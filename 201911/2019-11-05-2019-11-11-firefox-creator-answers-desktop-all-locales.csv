Every time I select one of those links, the web page overwrites the page I am looking at. If I don't remember to make a new tab, I must go back a page, open a new tab, and click the History or Bookmarks link again. I want History and Bookmarks links to ALWAYS open in new tabs. I can find no way to do that. I can find to keyboard shortcut that changes the behavior. Add-ons can do that for in-page links but not within Firefox links. I looked in about:config but found nothing of obvious relevance.
</p><p>Are there Firefox settings, Add-ons, or threats to Mozilla that will address this problem? Am I off track in thinking that this caters to the users of handheld device who lack space for many tabs?

I am running current Firefox on current W10 64bit 1903 desktop PC using Ethernet with Spectrum as my ISP.  I am having a couple of problems in Firefox that are not happening in current Chrome.  1.  Page-not-found 2-8 times a day that resolve every time by simply clicking the ""retry"" (or something close to that) button.   I reset my router to ""factory"" and installed most current router firmware but that did not help.  Netgear Support has been unable to help.  2.  In current LastPass addon, I have to re-login to LastPass every time I start Firefox - did not used to do that (a year ago), and in Chrome or Edge that does not happen.   I have re-installed the LastPass add-on.  I have upgraded Firefox many times and have cleared history/cache many times.  
So now I want to COMPLETELY remove Firefox, reboot,  and then install Firefox from scratch.  Can someone please point me to the web page that tells me how to properly remove all of Firefox so that I can re-download/install it from the beginning?  I do not care about retaining my Firefox settings or other from my current Firefox install.

Asi que lo que hice fue crear dos perfiles, el default lo llamé ""home"" e hice uno nuevo llamado ""work"". Luego en ~/.local/share/applications/ hice dos accesos de escritorio:

Exec=firefox -P home -private-window
</p><p>La única diferencia entre uno y el otro es que uno ejecuta el perfil home y el otro ejecuta el perfil work y cada uno tiene sus menus contextuales para gnome por separado para cada perfil.
</p><p>Entonces, desde el menú de gnome3 he agregado ambos accesos de firefox y funcionan muy bien, cuando hago click sobre el ícono firefox home inicia firefox con el perfil personal y cuando hago click a firefox work me aparece el perfil de trabaj con las pestañas, archivos y accesos del trabajo.
</p><p>El problema es que cuando inicio firefox este no mantiene el contexto de ejecución de la aplicación en el ícono de gnome, se crea un tercer ícono de firefox en el menú lateral y cuando inicio los dos perfiles estos se mezclan en este mismo tercer ícono.
</p><p>¿Porqué sucede esto?, ¿Cómo puedo hacer para que la ejecución de firefox quede asociada al ícono que lo ejecuta solamente?
</p><p>Por otro lado, no sería mala idea que Firefox pudiera utilizar de manera mas cómoda los perfiles y poder intercambiar entre uno y otro. Antiguamente usaba los grupos de pestaña para englobar mis pestañas del trabajo y los personales, pero desde que los eliminaron que he tenido que mezclar todo y uso muchas pestañas y se me hace un desorden, los grupos de pestaña eran una genialidad y me ayudaba a ordenar y separar todo. Así como lo hace Android por ejemplo que es capaz de mantener perfiles de trabajo y separar la ejecución de una misma app en dos contextos (trabajo y personal) en dos iconos separados (uno con una insignia de maletín), asi mismo sería genial que firefox tuviera la posibilidad de crear perfiles dentro del mismo navegador y poder acceder a estos perfiles a traves de accesos directos diferentes con insignias definidas por el usuario, talves de una lista pequeña de insignias que sean nativas de firefox, asi podriamos tener perfiles de pentetsing, desarrollo, personal, trabajo, etc. Me dirás ¿porqué no hacer todo eso en un mismo perfil?: porque por ejemplo para desarrollo uso github, para el trabajo tambien y cada ves que trabajo debo cambiar de cuenta, estar cerrando sesion y luego a la noche estar volviendo a iniciar sesion con mis cuentas personales, algo similar le pasa a la gente que usa facebook web de manera personal y para sus pequeñas empresas, por ejemplo conozco a gente que debe usar chrome y firefox al mismo tiempo para poder usar dos perfiles de facebook a la ves.

</p><p>As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css (see below for more info) that reduce the width of the address bar once placed in the Firefox <em>Profile</em> folder. In order to do that create a Folder named <em>chrome</em> on the desktop. Step two: Create a .TXT file, rename the Extention from <em>.txt</em> to <em>css</em> rename it <em>userChrome.css"" and place into the </em>Profile<em> folder with the following Code

</p><p>The scripts still works, again as mentioned on the 1st line of this post, As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css. So you will have to enable it to do so, or it won't work. In order to do that 
(1) Open a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.
(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste the word <em>userprof</em> if it's disabled, double click it to enable it. 
(3) In the search box above the list, search for <em>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</em> preference is not already set to true, double-click it to switch the value from false to true.
</p><p>(4) Close Mozilla Firefox 
(5) Insert the <em>chrome</em> folder you created it into the Firefox Profile folder (Tips on how to find that folder, above).
(6) Insert the userChrome.css file with the code in it (Instructions above) into the chrome folder in Profile folder. 
(7) Open Firefox.
</p><p>Sidenotes. The numbers located in the userChrome.css file are adjustable. If your URL/Adress Bar are too long or short,
lower the number incrementally to suite your preference. This is a working Tutorial as of Firefox 70.0.01

This is happening on my Win10 machine - my Win7 box is not having any issues since the update.
</p><p>I have followed the advice of creating new profiles, checking for locked profiles (and being unable to remove the lock?).  I have completely removed Firefox from my system - uninstalled via control panel, deleted all folders in Program Files and Users etc, removed temp files and edited the registry to completely remove any Mozilla/Firefox entries.  Completely clean install - as far as I can tell - but the problem re-appears as soon as Firefox is reinstalled.  I've tried all this in WIn10 safe mode as well but still no joy.
</p><p>The issue seems to be that there is a process running that cannot be terminated but I'm unable to kill the single remaining Firefox.exe process listed in task manager.  When I try 'taskkilll /IM firefox.exe /F' from the command prompt I get an error that the process can't be killed as an instance of it does not exist.  If I try 'taskkill /IM firefox.exe /T /F' it advises that a child process is keeping the main process alive - explorer.exe.  Terminating explorer.exe does not free up the firefox.exe process for termination (same error of the instance not existing).  The only way to clear the process is to reboot my system, Firefox will then start ok but when closed the issue will occur again.

The first sentence said (after the Did Not Connect part) makes it sound like YOU/Mozilla stopped it from working or going to the site, even though it's clearly the site itself that doesn't work in general (maybe from that expired certificate, NOT because it's an hour off LOL, OR they got attacked with malware like some others in past months). At least I know it's not just me that can't use those apps for now.

This is the worse software design I have ever seen from firefox. The old versions allowed you to delete ALL passwords with one simple click, it looks like the only way I can get passwords removed in firefox lockwise is do so individually. Who was the mental defect that designed firefox lockwise without providing a ONE CLICK way to remove all passwords?

</p><p>This isn't what I want, because I do want to be updating Firefox regularly, but I do not want it to interrupt things I am in the middle of working on to do it by *refusing to load pages* until I restart it.
</p><p>This is a nightmare when working on things that require multiple tabs, or worse when I'm submitting something via a form as this restart page and forced restart destroys what I was doing.
</p><p>I would be happy for it to automatically install the update on next restart. I will tolerate nag screens to remind me to restart the browser as soon as is practical. I *cannot* tolerate it absolutely ruining what I was doing by suddenly showing a demand to restart instead of the page I just submitted, or having something half written I need to check something for in another tab to find that I cannot do that and so cannot finish what I was doing before restarting.
</p><p>This update process is hostile, and disabling updates entirely is not at all what I want to do, I just want to control where my workflow is interrupted and avoid LOSS of work. But I can only seem to find the extreme options of no updates at all, or automatic updates that will randomly ruin what I am doing.
</p><p>If this is the new reality for Firefox I'll have to find something else to use, but having spent several hours trying to find a fix for this - and this not being the first time I looked as this has impacted me several times previously - even if there is a workaround it's incredibly poor form to not allow this option in a simple manner or to have such information easy to find.

I am trying to find the history of a specific URL, like the last time I opened it yesterday, but it seems that the most information History records or shows is the last time I opened it (today) and the total number of times I accessed this URL (4). I can't find any actual history of this URL in the History library. Am I missing something, or does the History feature record only the last access?
This would be very bad and a far cry from any kind of history.
Also, the Search feature does not seem to take into account the range of dates selected in the left pane. For instance, if I select ""September"" and search for my URL, it returns the URL that I accessed in November and that didn't even exist in September. The Search feature could be a little more contextual, and work on the whole history only if the root ""History"" folder is selected. But that's aside the main question, how to find the full history of a specific URL, not just its last access time.
Thanks.

I tried the device management in my account page, but I can't see anything on my new PC except itself, meanwhile I can see my old PC and iPhone itself on my iOS Firefox. I tried to re-sign in on my iPhone, and shockingly found that I can only use my old password to successfully sign in, the new password working on my new PC is a wrong one for my phone.
Then I tried to delete the account with new password on PC. After delete successful, sign in on my PC with that E-mail was correctly reported as ""unknown account"", but I can still sign in with the exact same E-mail and the old password on my phone, like nothing happened at all. At the same time, even if I tried the exact same combination of E-mail and old password on PC, the result is always ""unknown account"", like it already be deleted.

</p><p>My first time here, just recently switched from Chrome to Firefox, but seems like it's a bit problematic. 
Version 70.0 worked fine, but ever since 70.0.1, Firefox starts crashing (randomly). 99% of the time there is no error message, the browser just crashes(closes) and that's it, no crash report, no error, the only thing I can do is to restore previous session. Usually, after crashing, it will crash again 2-3 times upon opening the browser, until it will finally work...for a while. 
Rarely there have been errors, saying the same thing - memory could not be read (attached in the post). Does not happen with any other browsers. All my drivers and software are up to date, memory is OK, (did windows memory diag and memtest86), hardware is okay, tried disabling plugins and hardware acceleration, still nothing. All that ever since 70.0.1, before that it worked fine. Is it just me or anyone else having that problem? 
If any additional info is needed, let me know.

</p><p>I do the IT support for my dad (85+ years): 
Firefox 70.0.1 64 bit on Windows 10 Home 64 bit, all up to date.
He has various passwords saved in FF, but I specifically instructed FF to exempt the sites he uses for Online Banking sites from saving passwords. 
</p><pre>  ""Access &amp; Passwords"" &gt; Exceptions: sites listed (entered by clicking ""NEVER save"" when asked on login). 
</pre>
<p>I have FF delete all data upon closure: 
</p><pre>  ""Delete history when FF is closed"" all EXCEPT for ""Website Settings"" (which I learned would also kill the password save barrier)
</pre>
<p>Now, I don't know what my dad does; every time I check after a week these settings are gone and FF is happily back, offering the saved login details to his Online Banking sites, also the Exception list is empty. My dad cannot say what he did to change this and maintains ""he didn't do anything"" (see also: typical IT support customer statements). 
Sometimes I find he has even reinstalled FF for no good reason (which I can see in the Apps bar). But this should not affect the Profile settings, and even if he should have agreed to delete profile data: the bookmarks are still there, so it's not all gone. 
</p><p>For now I have deactivated FF from saving any passwords, which is the safe choice when Online Banking is involved (no, my dad won't agree to close the Online Banking Account altogether go to the bank). But this creates new problems with all the other less sensitive sites where he needs to enter passwords (newspaper sites etc.), which he misplaces and keeps on resetting them (to passwords which he will again not remember the next time round). 
</p><p>My next thought was to set permissions.sqlite to read-only, as I found this is where FF stores the exception list. Unfortunately, I realized that FF apparently updates this file every time it's run and ignores it if it finds it is out of sync with what it expects, returning to the clear sheet. So this doesn't help. 
</p><p>I guess I could set up an autorun batch file to delete the profile directory and restore a golden reference directory, but this could be error-prone too. 
</p><p>So I was wondering if the community can point me to a way to permanently fix a given list of Password-Save-Exceptions which cannot be altered by the user? Something like a config setting, available or hidden? 
</p><p>Thanks for any advice or pointers,
Akebinko

After browsing for a while when I open a new tab and try to load a web page large parts of Firefox become unresponsive, for example I can close other tabs, move tabs, use websites in other Firefox windows largely unaffected but I cannot view other tabs in the window I opened the crashing tab. The unresponsive tab just sits there with a loading animation in the tab name, white screen, what ever website I tried to visit cleared from the address bar.
</p><p>Opening additional tabs is possible but the crashing window will not switch to those tabs, while in another window I can open a new tab but actually visiting a site or opening a link in a new tab will crash that window. 
</p><p>Opening new windows once I'm crashing results in a crashed window regardless if I use the empty page or load a URL.
</p><p>Lastly if I click on a link before a tab crashes nothing will happen. No tab will open, no tabs will crash, the link won't turn purple. But at this point I can go fully about my business reading the existing loaded content in all my working tabs and windows. Opening the link in a new tab with context menus will crash the new tab immediately.
</p><p>Once a tab has crashed I am forced to close the browser. It usually takes a while to fully shutdown, but it's never unresponsive enough to need to be killed in the Task Manager.
</p><p>And sometimes this entire process corrupts my profile and I get to re-login to everything on the web again.
</p><p>Now, here's the frustrating part. I don't know how to troubleshoot this. The issue has persisted through:
- Firefox versions 67, 68, and 70
- My machine was re-imaged with a new Windows image when I was upgraded to an SSD. The previous image didn't have Firefox preinstalled, the new image did(68). I purged that and installed 70 and the issue continues.
- I have disabled hardware acceleration multiple times(because my profile keeps getting reset).
- There are no crash logs.
- I haven't taken to time to reproduce the error with no extensions but I've A/B tested that I can crash running just uBlock or just Tusk. I'm not running a lot of extensions because the profile keeps getting reset.
- Firefox isn't actually crashing, no crash reports are being generated, Windows event log is clean.

</p><p>At this point in time, I have been using Firefox (standard installation) in some kind of black/night/dark mode for a few weeks.
Because the color scheme is not always helpful, some websites are just not able to be navigated and I want to turn it off.
</p><p>For reasons unclear, I cannot.  If I go to Settings Bars (hamburger?)&gt; Options&gt; Colors...
The settings already indicate black text and white background.
</p><p>Uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox changing various choices about (refreshing, or not) has NOT worked.
</p><p>Note:  I am running in a Windows 10 Dark Mode environment ~~~ I don't know if Firefox is merely inheriting that.
Regardless, even installing a dark/night mode extension to place controls in the browser bar does nothing to restore a normal look to Firefox.  By contrast, Chrome allows a toggle switch, per browser window, that allows me to change up the color scheme so I can see important information while searching a give internet page.
</p><p>How do I return to normal Firefox appearance when uninstalls do not correct the problem??
</p><p>Truly Exasperating.

There has GOT to be a better answer. It's been too many years of this making excuses.
</p><p>If nothing else, can't someone develop JUST a rinky dinky program/add-in that loops through all open pages one by one, closing, pausing while we check Taskman, then reopening so we can see the effect? That would be TRIVIAL for someone to write just that crude thing. But it would save people breathtaking amounts of time because we're having to do this manually, over and over and over and over and over. Even with this simple routine, it could be enhanced to record the CPU load from Taskman or TaskInfo or something, since we'd be slowly, ploddingly writing down or pasting the results as I stepped through the pages one by one.
</p><p>Better yet, ideally, just do this, which also should not be technically difficult - seriously. Take some unused field and populate it with identifying information (like the Save As name of the page), then inform Microsoft (for taskman, resmon) and Iars (for TaskInfo) where it is. Or write our own CPU monitor extract just to measure FX CPU, that displays which PID goes with which window)(s).
</p><p>THAT'S WHAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. An indication of which browser instances go with which PIDs. Even if there's some overlap, if PID 6632 is using an entire core and more of my desktop, if I can just even partially limit which browser windows are burning there, that would be enormous.
</p>
<pre>For example
PID....FX-ID
15......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
15......mozilla.com / (name of page, ...
15.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
25......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
25.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
33.....ameritrade.com / (name of page, ...
33.....yahoo.finance / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....goduckgo.com / (name of page, ...
etc.</pre>
<p>If the reason no one's done this is because there's more than one page associated with each PID, that's covered in the listing above. Just list what you know, every one of them. Do you see how powerful that would be, if we knew that PID 15 was shredding the CPU, and we could at least limit it to a limited number of possible criminal pages?
</p><p>I keep numerous windows open and like it or not the reality is that one or more of them are running obscenely rude loops to refresh the page or scan for input or whatever. I have a very well equipped desktop but it is hammered by one or more such sites. I and I am sure others have wasted hours and hours and hours hunting and pecking to diagnose this, and there's NO END to it, because there will continue to be piss poor webpages that suck CPU and disk. Even from <a href=""http://microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">microsoft.com</a>, as you surely know to be often the worst performers of all. I use NoScript but that is not perfect; you have to continuously adjust it for different sites, and you don't know WHICH sites need to be throttled down. It's wildly inefficient when we're shooting in the dark, because we DON'T KNOW WHICH BROWSER WINDOW is the jerkoff.
</p><p>BTW I have many WINDOWS open - almost never tabs. It is almost always massively more efficient than using tabs when you have many. Namely, with windows I can use Windows' own alt-tab, or click or hover the taskbar to navigate.
</p><p>I volunteer a lot of my time, a lot, both in technical areas and in personal charity. I'd do this myself, but I have no browser or HTML development background. Can't someone please come up with something? Asking for the millionth time, please? Sorry I'm getting nasty but there's all this senseless massive waste of time, and it will never go away - unless you heroically answer the call.

Have used it for quite a while and no problems printing either from online or from a desktop application. I am constantly printing PDFs from online -- e.g., receipts of bills paid, articles to do with my work, etc. In past, when I print a new PDF, it automatically opens, just like when printing from within desktop applications. This is a very necessary step in my work because of the volume that I print. I've been doing this for YEARS, and it has always worked. Now, suddenly, the PDFs no longer open upon printing from online (printing from desktop apps still works as expected). I have not personally changed any settings in either Firefox or Acrobat DC. But something must be different. Is it a glitch due to a Firefox update? Or could something have changed a setting for me?

</p><p>I love Mozilla products but with the push to get users on your cloud services Sync and Lockwise (I've got a bone to pick with you about that but that's another subject) where are the tools to support users wishing to make a Subject Access Request, do they exist already and I've missed them?

Constantemente, o Windows 10 instala sozinho alguns aplicativos e consequentemente, substitui o Mozilla Firefox como navegador padrão, o Adobe, instala loja, etc. Já fiz bloqueio pelo BlockEdge mas não resolveu.. 
O Outro problema grave é que com a instalação sozinha feita pelo Windows 10, tudo que estava configurado no Firefox (Página Inicial, favoritos, Barra de Menu, Segurança de senha, etc) desaparece. Tenho que configurar o navegador Firefox tudo novamente. 
Por favor, alguém pode me ajudar como resolver e inibir que o Windows faça essas alterações no meu PC?
Geralmente, essas atualizações acontecem quando eu ligo o PC. 
Inclusive, quando eu coloco algum bloqueador, o PC fica sem ligar as vezes, até que seja instalado todas as atualizações que o Windows 10 quer... Eu já pensei que fosse problema com fonte, memória, ou coisa do tipo.. mas não é.
Um absurdo isso que o Windows está fazendo.. Esse navegador edge é muito ruim,,,,
Aguardo orientações...

</p><p>I enabled hardware acceleration in about:preferences.
Furthermore I set to true the following in about:config:
</p><p>-gfx.direct2d.force-enabled;
</p><p>-gfx.webrender.all;
</p><p>-gfx.webrender.enabled;
</p><p>-layers.acceleration.force-enabled;
</p><p>-webgl.force-enabled;
</p><p>Nevertheless I notice that opening multiple tabs cause YouTube audio interruptions in the case that one of Firefox’s tabs is playing a video on YouTube.
Doing the same with Chrome doesn’t cause audio interruptions even opening a lot of tabs.
I think this is because hardware acceleration in Firefox isn’t working.
I think this because I see that the processor it is very loaded when opening multiple tabs of Firefox.
Processor is not very loaded opening multiple tabs of Chrome.
Am I right?
Why this problem doesn’t happen on Chrome?
How can I make Firefox like Chrome?
Thank you in advance for your answers!

On the proprietary website of my credit union, after their recent 2-factor security upgrade, I now see ghosts of code instructions associated with drop-down menus and fill-in boxes. (Please see attached screen capture.) Have not encountered this on any other website. When I log in to the site on Chrome, I don't see this, just the regular page I am used to. I have turned off AdBlockers. Anything else I could do to get a normal image back so I can see the boxes I want to fill in? I am still on Windows7 for Home (will upgrade this Christmas) using Firefox 70.0.1 (64-bit). Any advice, beyond opting for Chrome?
