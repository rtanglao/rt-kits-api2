</p><p>I tried to define one of the bookmarks that is supposed to be in the toolbar, but could not. Firefox is happy to let me _edit_ it, because it is already defined, and will let me move it to any location except the toolbar, which is where it now is -- except that it isn't. How can I make Firefox display my bookmark toolbar again?

Pinned tabs are so unstable that they are basically useless. Currently pinned tabs are unpinning themselves when I load and work in forms on the corresponding pages. I'm not accidentally unpinning them. It's happening spontaneously for no apparent reason. It isn't related to any tab extensions. I am certain of this because I have disabled all of them and it still keeps happening. Click tab, work on page, click other tab to do form work on other tab, go back to previous tab and it's not there because it's unpinned. It's gotten maddening to be perfectly honest as there doesn't appear to be any solution to the problem and I've honestly reached the point after this feature being so unstable for so long that I don't understand why the feature even exists since it's never worked reliably sine it's inception. What's going on with this? I used to be able to use tab locking addons that worked far better than this but now no one is able to make them due to the changes. Is this ever going to improve or should I just give up dreaming?

</p><p>Alright, there was maybe some trouble-shooting I skipped over however this had its reasoning.  However onto the problem.  I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser.  My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ).  The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load.  In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space.
</p><p>I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked.  I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter.  So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe.  However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on.  When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine.
</p><p>Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head.  I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default.  I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem.  Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem.
</p><p>Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet.  Here's hoping I catch some good advice.  :3

<p>As can be seen under the default profile listing is the locked=1 line or setting.
So does this lock the profile so no changes can be made, or only lock some parts or does the 1 indicate it is unlocked or what?
All the profile.ini articles and examples do not show the locked= line at all or even mention it as an optional setting.

Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit) does not always use GDI rendering,"<p>Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit) is the only version that allows switching to GDI rendering with hacks. The hacks involve setting gfx.canvas.azure.backends and gfx.content.azure.backends to just cairo.

</p><p>The problem with DirectWrite is that the text is rendered with way too many dark gray pixels, causing text to become unrealistically thicker and more distorted. On the other hand, GDI uses correct gamma and fully respects font hinting, meaning text renders exactly as the type designer intended.

Currently using a gtx 1070ti, and Nvidia had no insight on the issue after much runabout with their live chat support, and I've since isolated that it only occurs with firefox and hardware acceleration within it enabled. On occasion I see elements on webpages vanish or go blank until you mouse or click a bit, images tessellate or show up very large for a second, and I've seen it cause entire screen-wide flickers of horizontal white lines for a very brief moment. 
</p><p>I'm curious if this issue is known or how I can make it known. I was worried it was a hardware issue at first, or that it was drivers, but after complete fresh installations and removals with ddu, nothing else having issues for 2 years, and isolating the problem to only occur with firefox open and hardware acceleration enabled and other issues unique to inside the browser, I think it's more likely something on Mozilla's end. At this point I think there's nothing left for me to do on my end, but maybe somebody has some more insight.

I have a lot of memes and pictures (5000+)... the ""search"" in the upper right hand corner does not allow me to search anything about 99% of the time ... I click into it but the cursor never appears ... stays in the lower filename below ... I can scroll through the entire list if I happen to know the image file name and grab it to insert it ... just the search doesn't work - very frustrating .... I thought it was facebook privacy settings per person I was replying to, but then I finally opened up Windows Edge browser and now it works all the time in that browser.  I made sure ""search"" service is turned ON in my Windows 10 environment ... appears to be a problem mainly in Firefox (latest version) and Internet Explorer 11 ... now I know Edge works but I like Firefox better.  I don't have many addons - I do have adblock for firefox but it does not make any difference in this area.

However in Firefox, when I go to print a crossword puzzle from the wall street journal it prints the puzzle in the upper left quadrant, about half size.  Doing the same thing with another site, everything is fine, and if I use a different browser, it is fine.  Also, depending upon the site, I get a different print set up page, and it appears that the problem lies only on one of these setup pages.  I have tried changing just about every setting to no avail.

I have talked to apple...they tell me to use safari.  I like firefox.  Now, my issue.  When I am on a web pags (this occurs randomly) I am bounced from the web page I am on to a previous web site I was on.  I do nothing nor click on anything to cause this.  It just happens.  When I am on facebook, this will happen and bounce me off facebook and put me on a web page i had been on during the same session.  This was not happening until I just got the latest Catalina update a week ago.  I do not know how to fix this issue.  Are there settings needing to be changed in the apple IOS?  If so what are they?  Is there something I can change in my facebook account?  Is there something I can change in my Firefox browser account?  Or should I just sit tight, grin and bare it until firefox makes changes via an update and fixes this issue.  I am beginning to think, I should have stuck with my windows 10 system instead of moving to apple.  I am just frustrated that I can not fix this issue.  Any ideas out there?  Thanks, Jim

Certain operations caused Firefox to crash, but no crash reports are created &amp; I do not receive a Crash notification. One example is that when I receive an email that contains something I need to print like labels or tickets, Firefox crashes when I try to print &amp; if continue to try to print, it always crashes. Here is an example of a return label.
<a href=""https://www.wayfair.com/session/secure/account/print_labels.php?label_id=11186731&amp;Or=2953552973&amp;Svc=&amp;csn_id=A691DFAE-672C-4481-9D3B-EB2D17913431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wayfair.com/session/secure/account/print_labels.php?label_id=11186731&amp;Or=2953552973&amp;Svc=&amp;csn_id=A691DFAE-672C-4481-9D3B-EB2D17913431</a> 
Another example is downloading. If I try to download, Firefox crashes, again with no crash report or notification to me. Many times when I try again it works the second time. But sometimes it doesnt. Firefox just closes without a trace. Then I have to do restore last session. As I said, with some operations, it works if I do it again, but with others it does not. 
I looked at Windows Event Viewer &amp; the application log. It has many evens for each day &amp; a total of 17,703. I found one from a couple of days ago that mentions Firefox &amp; another one that mentions Software Protection &amp; lists a number of items with a long list of letters &amp; numbers that look like Firefox crash reports  
When I use Chrome, I dont have these problems. So I have made Chrome my default browser although I prefer Firefox if these problems can be fixed. Thank you. Jonathan Rose

removed Mozilla from AppData folder. No instances of Firefox popped up in task manager and resource monitor during process just to make sure.

My first stop was the ""customize..."" option in the Firefox menu. Why can't I ""customize..."" Firefox so that the address bar, and navigation buttons are hidden?. And why is there no way to disable+hide the use of tabs in ""Preferences""?. I spent the better part of two weeks searching the Internet (and Firefox add-ons) trying to find a way to achieve this chromeless experience. I remembered that there is JavaScript that will automatically open a webpage's popup window(s) in a chromeless mode. I found examples online and decided to create a local "".html"" file on my Linux Mint 19.2 (XFCE) system, add the code, then have Firefox open this local page (file:/home/user/Documents/index.html) instead of a online homepage. I disabled the ""Block pop-up windows"" option, and added the local ""index.html"" file to the exceptions. It didn't work. I checked the ""about:config"" settings in Firefox and found JavaScript to already be enabled. I used all the examples I found online, but none of them seem to work.

Currently Firefox 71.0  cannot connect to the internet in any of them.  Opera can connect in both Org and Ma accounts but not the Pu account .  I have used Firefox and Opera without any issues for the past few months.
</p><p>CHRONOLOGY
Late last week Firefox and Opera could not connect from either Pu or Org while Chrome and Edge could.   
Removing Firefox and Opera from the list of allowed programs in Zone Alarm, cold booting and adding them to Zone Alarm did not work.
I upgraded Opera from 65.0.3467.62 to 65.0.3467.72
I executed netsh winsock reset and netsh int ip reset
As a result Opera can connect to the internet from Ma but no longer can connect from Pu.
After uninstalling Adobe Flash Player Opera was able to connect from Ma.

I get odd spaces between them and even at the beginning of the tab bar.  (see image).
</p><p>I don't use plug-ins for the tab parameters/behaviors, they're all .css- based.
</p><p>The things I want: 
</p><p>- tabs below the bookmark toolbar.
- Bookmark toolbar below the below the address bar.
- Fixed width tabs (100 px).
- Less height being used by the bookmark tool bar. (~30px).
- Tab height a little larger than the bookmark height (~40px).
</p><p>Over the years, I've sort of piecemealed the .css code and it's probably a blazing mess right now for what I want to have.  My old .css worked GREAT in FF 70, but it doesn't in FF71.  I probably need to have it cleaned up by someone who had a lot more experience than I do.

</p><p>For example, Options - General - Files and Applications - Applications - Choose how Firefox handles the files you download from the web or the applications you use while browsing. Content Type: PDF, Action: [we change it to what we want, such as ""use Bluebeam"" or ""use Adobe"" or ""preview in Firefox"", and then it will re-set to something else, such as ""Save File"" (which saves the file to Downloads and does not open the file in a program)]
</p><p>And also Options - General - Firefox Updates - Keep Firefox up to date for the best performance, stability, and security. 
Allow Firefox to...
Automatically install updates (recommended)
OR 
Check for updates but let you choose to install them
[in older versions of the browser, there was also a third option for NOT automatically checking for updates at all. But newer versions of Firefox do not seem to offer this.]
Whichever of the first two options we choose, we have had cases where Firefox does not preserve the selection and switches the user to the other selection.
</p><p>When the selections get re-set to something other than what the user chose, it likely happens due to a Firefox software update. 
</p><p>I have been told by an IT consultant that the way to preserve the selections is to use Firefox Sync and under ""choose what to sync,"" make sure the ""Options"" box is ticked. But we have done that, and users with Sync turned on still find that not all of their Options selections are preserved.

So I lost my Firefox 52 install with all of my extensions (that still worked).  Now, I'm running v. 57 Quantum, and a few things aren't working correctly.
</p><p>First, the MAJOR problem:  when I open a link from a bookmark, it's clobbering an existing tab that I was using (that's why it was open, obviously).  That is completely unsat and can not be allowed to continue.  How do I correct this?  I can't find the option under settings--&gt;tabs to fix this problem.
</p><p>Second issue (major annoyance):  I can no longer create a bookmark directly in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar.  I used to be able to open that bookmark folder, and the first option was to bookmark the currently open tab.  That option has vanished, and i use that all the time.  How do I restore that?
</p><p>Actually, one more issue:  I have two tabs that are pinned and are supposed to be protected (i.e., nothing can clobber them, and I can't close them without deliberately turning the protection off (context menu right-clicking on tab).  I need that back, because for some reason, firefox thinks it's ok to open a bookmark in those tabs, too, when it most definitely is NOT ok.

On the left, when I'm not connected to the headphones, the sound plays via the speakers and you can clearly see mozilla's audio levels in green are ok. When I connect the headphones (middle photo) the sound still plays via the speakers but there are two firefoxes and one is playing audio, the other is not. I don't know why there are two, I only have one tab open. Lastly, when I switch the audio device to headphones, Firefox completely disappears from the list of applications playing audio. I opened up other browsers and played audio in each and they are listed in the applications, as you can see in the last photo. They are actively playing audio as indicated by the green audio levels and I can hear them via the headphones. Firefox on the other hand, is still playing via my computer's speakers.

Neither of these options are preferable. Is it possible to bypass HSTS for this site or will firefox force me to wait for the site admins to fix it (doubtful because the certificate expired in early October)? Is there a command line flag, or a patch to the source code that will permit this?

I then restarted firefox. However, the shockwave flash plugin is not present in the plugins tab. This is odd as it was a couple of days ago before I redid this. Sites like newgrounds worked perfectly. Back when flash was working, I noticed on some sites that used html5, it would instead try to use flash. For a whille, the openh264 was stuck on ""will be installed shortly."" Now when I go to those sites, it will show the thumbnail, but not play. Youtube videos still work, however.

3) first Visit about:profiles in latest firefox, set the default profile to a new profile ""switchToMeBeforeLoadingOldFirefox"". Close browser and reopen, note a default blank profile. Close new firefox. Open old firefox without internet at above - frustratingly just doing this with my 'real' profile open in the mac's finder, I can see the sqlite temprary files being created in my 'real' profile when firefox 51 is open, corrupting it all as above. The files in the profile 'switchToMeBeforeLoadingOldFirefox' seem unaltered
</p><p>That last point was particularly unexpected! Can someone provide a fullproof process please?

The behaviors started some time in the last six months or so.  I just noticed them in the last week when I updated the website.  The website is <a href=""https://281connections.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/</a>  and I am using using Firefox 71.0 on Ubuntu Mate 19.04  . . .
Question 1
When accessing the hosted site, the script that toggles the menu to drop down is ignored (<a href=""https://281connections.us/#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/#</a> ).  (Using a Chromium browser, I can get the script to run by telling it to “load unsafe scripts”.)  The script in question is run in Firefox without objection when the same code/site is invoked from files local to my machine.  I can not find a setting in Firefox to allow the script to execute when invoked from hosted source.  I have tried an assortment of settings changes, but can’t find anything that works.  Can you help?
Question 2
Javascript that runs a dynamic page (<a href=""https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html</a> ) runs just fine using Firefox and the hosted website.  However, when invoked on local files, it does not run.  (It presents a large circle, but never fills it with information.)  Is there a setting that will allow me to see dynamic page when invoked locally?  (BTW, the behavior is identical using Chromium for what that is worth.)

When attempting to use FF to log in to One Drive directly -- meaning, I go straight to the One Drive login page via bookmark, and do not attempt to enter One Drive via a ""side door"" such as a link on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> -- I encounter significant latency and, often, outright non-responsiveness. Last Pass will not autofill the login credentials; nor can I type them in directly with anything other than crippling latency, if at all. Same latency with password and 2-factor entry. If I am able to survive log-in, One Drive presents significant lag to clicks, often accompanied by fleeting clues in the lower-left corner of the screen, usually involving cryptography such as ""waiting for cdn-15 <a href=""http://office.net"" rel=""nofollow"">office.net</a> . . . "" or something similar. Often the word ""Excel"" or ""Word"" will be displayed in one of those messages, but they are so fleeting (and appear to be truncated for display) that I can't capture them completely.
</p><p>Switching off extensions appears to have no effect. The lag and general unresponsiveness continues.
</p><p>Interestingly, when I instead log in directly to Outlook (and not One Drive), and then move into One Drive via a One Drive link that is presented in the Outlook waffle button, then One Drive appears to behave promptly and normally. No lag issues that I can determine. (Also, with all FF extensions=true, login and use of Outlook is satisfactory. No problems that I can see).
</p><p>The Windows One Drive app, which runs on the local system, also appears to function normally. I can see/modify files in my One Drive via the local app. That's groovy, but sometimes you need to see the file system in the web browser.
</p><p>So I guess that's the workaround: Get access to One Drive by going *through* Outlook. Okay, but why? What's going on? How to fix?

</p><p>Periodically, at unpredictable intervals, Firefox reverts my choice of spellcheck dictionary (English US) to English Australian. In the FF Preferences i don't even have Australian as an option: i have only UK, US, and Canada. Nonetheless, now and then, FF will start marking the word ""color"" as misspelled, at which point i know that the dictionary has once again been swapped out. Right-clicking the misspelled word and selecting ""Languages..."" reveals that Australian is always, without exception, the one it's been switched to.
</p><p>My system-wide language is US English. Nothing, on any of my systems, is configured to use Australian, so FF making this particular choice of dictionaries completely befuddles me.
</p><p>The ""troubleshooting information"" which was automatically attached to this post confirms that i don't have Australian English activated in FF.

</p><p>Thanks to Mozilla for continuing to develop such a clean browser, with movies made of GIF instead of much larger files.
</p><p>So we have developed an extension or add-on for many years using the same method. But recently ( maybe I forgot ), with a new developer profile, I am unable to edit any files because the .xpi extension in the extensions folder, is compressed and cannot be navigated in a file Explorer.
</p><p>In the past, I just install the extension and change the file extension from .xpi to .zip, and then extract into a folder with the same name. Then delete the .xpi/.zip folder, and the new folder acts as a pointer for the same instance of installation. And I can just modify the files in that folder usually and I don't need to restart the browser to see the changes. But lately I cannot do this.
</p><p>What is the best way to debug the add-on with the least number of steps?
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>Josh

I understand how difficult Sync is and have read the deep dive article on how it is being (or has been) rebuilt to work ""properly"".
I have just one question - but here's why: Sync still has the ability to mess up bookmarks between my 5 Windows machines. 
So all I want is a clear way to do this: 
I'd like to fix up all my bookmarks on one machine : let's call it ""A"" - and then propagate that to all the others. 
I tried doing this by 
A. Stopping sync on all, 
B. Fixing up the duplicates, empty folders and other messed up things in bookmarks on A manually
C. Starting Sync again. 
And within a day my 5 hour marathon had been completely wasted as they were in a heck of a mess again. 
Could someone please try and include ""A straightforward way to reset and rebuild your bookmarks- AND SYNC THEM!"" in the design doc?
And put that a set of clear instructions somewhere?
But in the meantime - please let me know how I do this. Surely ""reset  and rebuild from here"" is an obvious requirement?
Thanks guys - this hurts because I'm completely in love with the ""new"" Firefox and how safe I feel with it. So help me here!

</p><p>In both instances, after logging in, it doesn't give me any indication of being finished - instead it prompts me to ""install on another device"". Most recently, on this computer, it asked me to send an SMS to my phone to login to Firefox Sync on my phone.
</p><p>This would be reasonable, except for the fact that I'm already using Firefox on my phone, and have it actively logged in with the account I'm logging in to. When I go to look at my devices on <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>, I have 6 devices listed, including my phone ""last seen 7 hours ago"" and my main computer ""last seen 3 hours ago"". It's clear to me that these are active devices, and that I don't need to install on any other devices to get sync working.
</p><p>The main reason this is annoying is that I don't get any confirmation that I've completed logging in - only a prompt to do something unnecessary. I can work around this by simply ignoring the prompt, but I'm concerned for other less tech-savvy consumers who might be confused, thinking they're still not done when they login to Sync on their second device! Imagine someone logs into their phone first, and then the computer - it'd be pretty confusing to then have the computer ask them to sign in on the phone.
</p><p>I personally was slightly confused, and had to double check that bookmarks were actually syncing and that I hadn't accidentally made a new account or done something to erase my previously logged-in devices...

I used the places.sqlite from that but I was still getting an empty history and it was also not recording any more new history. I also tried pasting the entire backup profile folder onto the main profile folder. And I tried creating a new profile and transferring my places.sqlite there but I get the same result. However my bookmarks are still there. 
</p><p>Is there no way to get my history back? I'm guessing it is a corrupted places.sqlite. Is it possible to repair the places.sqlite? Sadly I don't have any knowledge on how to use SQlite shell to repair it myself. It would be nice if someone could do that for me! Strangely, the places.sqlite file size is 10240kb, which seems a bit too small for my entire history. 
</p><p>I'm terrible at explaining things so I apologize if it was hard to follow. I'm distraught about this and pretty desperate to get my history back. I'd appreciate any help.

</p><p>I am NOT having a performance issue.  Instead, the browser is not responding as expected when given tasks.
</p><p>1.  It will not open a link in a new tab.  The tab does not open and it's as if I never clicked on the menu item.  Same with open in new window.
2.  It will not open the default search engine from the URL bar.  Instead, it responds as if I mistyped a URL.
3.  It will not allow me to set a Default Search Engine.  The option to do that in Preferences is a drop-down arrow that does nothing when clicked.
4.  It will not allow me to Remove an add-on.  Usually issues with Firefox are related to add-ons, but when I Remove an add-on, then restart Firefox, the add-on is still there.
5. (silly, minor issue) I'd like the tab bar to be dark, again.  The white tabs are too bright!  I know this is silly, but you asked...

Not only does it not update for that UID, instead putting it into the ""no username"" storage for this website, but it is storing asterisks (in the same amount as the actual password) instead of the password.  Yes, I clicked on the little ""eye"" next to the password field under Tools.Options.Privacy .. and yes, I tried trusting and just using the stored password both for the UID (it kept the old password) and also for the ""no username"" and neither works.  I can update the password manually when under Tools.Options.Privacy, but I do not have the time nor inclination to do this for hundreds of logins.

However there's not means of archiving, syncing or backup for all your fastidious work configuring your various websites to open within specific containers.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu)
</p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible. Keep in mind it is already installed. I want to find the page for it at <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> so that I can reinstall it in the future should I need to do a fresh installation.

So, is there some setting somewhere in the about:config where I can control which monitor is default? I can't find an obvious one, at least.
EDIT: I was wrong. It doesn't always open the video on the 1st monitor. It just always opens the video on the monitor to the left of the one the browser is on. :D

I would like to give each of them a rating to help other people find better extensions, but there seems no easy way to do so.
On Google Play you can review installed extensions in Play Store easily by click each of them and use the one-tap rating button.
On iOS, if you allow them, App Store will even prompt you a one-tap rater after you've installed some app and used for a while, which is even more convenient.
I wonder if Firefox (could) have the same experience. Without it, it's harder to encourage people (who wish to spare the time) to involve in the rating system.

Now if FF crashes for some reason or there is a power outage, sometimes session restore only works for one profile that is restarted first, while the others lose all the tabs that were open last time. Now I have a feeling that this is much more likely to happen if the browser was recently updated (it happened several times on the first restart after the update).
I reckon that this might have something to do with the session restore only restoring one of the opened windows (which, as I understand, is now fixed).
In each of the profiles the automatic session restore is set on.

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected. 
</p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there.
</p>
<ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install. Stylus also doesn't work, and all my styles have vanished. Tampermonkey worked running a script on Youtube, but once again, on startup, the script was gone.

Os dejo el enlace al complemento:

I mistakenly clicked a link in Outlook that opened Firefox for that webpage.  I quickly closed it from the toolbar, realizing I might lose all the other tabs, and I did lose them.  I had at least 14 in one, 16 in another, and is there any way I can go back and retrieve them?  Does Firefox keep any backups of open tabs so I can get to them?  I had so many open, there's no way I can remember which ones they were, because I multitask like crazy.  Now, I'm afraid to use it at all, just in case the more I do, the more the previous sessions will be lost.  YIKES!  I just moved, got my computer back up and running, and now this.  I could chew my own arm off for this.  Can anybody out there help me?

Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment.
</p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again.
</p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem....
</p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.  And just FYI, the rep also agreed that my ad blockers should not have been an issue.  Reluctantly, I went to MS Edge - I was able to log in.   I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible.
</p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password.""
	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway
	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.'
	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.  However, I do not use the 'saved log ins' feature or use a oligarch password - I get the impression that is what would be affected if I followed the provisions outlined, and so may not apply to my issue.  Right?
</p><p>All that said... does anyone have any idea why I cannot log in to the SSA site using FF?

I am extremely frustrated, and at my wits end dealing with this problem.  Any reasonable assistance and solutions are appreciated.  Thank you.

This is done with the Task Manager.
However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks.
Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10.
I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes.

Even when I enable the ""offline mode"",  tabs with heavy javascript continue trying to load, consuming CPU resources. I want they to stop immideately. I tried different extensions, but results are unsatisfactory. Does anybody know some trick?
My goal is to find a method to flush all javascript structures in RAM. I explored about:memory, and tried the vmmap.exe (process memory analyzer) from the Sysinternals Suite, but I have not succeeded so far.
Auto unload tab -- is not a solution. For example I clicked on links and opened 30 tabs in background. PC starts working very slow, Now I want to stop all them, and to read the loaded information (webpages). How to do it? I think it is the weakest side of Firefox. Needed to abrupt all attempts to make network connection, after the ""offline mode"" is enabled.
I need something to stop javascript's attempts to connect, to calm it down. I want to start read webpages already loaded, and javascript occupies CPU. To kill threads in the Process Manager is not a way to do at all, Auto-unload also, I want to read those webpages.  I have enough of RAM, it is not used more then a half. 
Many years ago, when there was HTML4, I used for a little the Maxton browser. It had a button to stop all pages. All similiar Firefox extensions do not act effectively like that.
the issue not in scarcity of RAM, but in a badly design of browser's architecture, that javascript occupies users' PCs.

</p><p>I log out of devices that I do not own when I'm exiting Firefox. Today I opened Firefox on a device that I'm 100% certain I logged out of yesterday - and found that my bookmarks, bookmarks bar, and add-ons were already visible and active, and one of my add-ons was already logged in.

I was not logged into Firefox - and the Firefox interface confirmed that this morning, in addition to confirming it when I logged out yesterday - yet somehow not only were my personal bookmarks showing, but one of my add-ons was also logged in, providing further access to anyone who might have opened a Firefox window from this device.

The other is AnonymoX which I use for general purposes.
</p><p>A few days ago I upgraded to Firefox 71.0 as well as updated my Windows 10 to the latest 1903 version. Today I noticed that both extensions have stopped working. AnonymoX just doesn't work, whereas the other plugin, upon activation, says (translated) ""Conflict detected! Proxy settings are controlled by a different plugin or cannot be set up"" Trying to circumvent a block (and only then - unblocked websites work fine) now either redirects me to the ISPs blocking page, or alternatively produces a ""Secure Connection Failed PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR""  message after a long TLS handshake. Running the same extensions in Chrome does not reproduce the issue - blocked websites become accessible as usual. The issue also persists for three different connections - a public wi-fi network, a private network and a tethered 4G connection, all served by different ISPs. Finally, I am not running any anti-virus software or firewall. Thus this seems to be a Firefox issue and not a system or network issue. 
</p><p>This also doesn't seem to be an issue with the country's blocking system itself because other users around me are still able to circumvent blocks using the same extensions and I am able to circumvent blocks using a similar extension on my Android phone with a local SIM. 
</p><p>Things I've tried so far:
1) Made sure that both Windows and Firefox are set to not use a proxy
</p><p>2) Reinstalled the extensions
</p><p>3) Created a different profile in Firefox. The extensions don't work in the new profile either, although the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR does not appear - I just always get redirected to the respective ISPs block page
</p><p>4) Cleared all cache, cookies, site settings etc.
</p><p>5) Deleted the cert9.db file and let Firefox recereate it
</p><p>So far nothing has worked. I'm frankly at a loss here. I have half a mind to just reinstall Firefox altogether since this is not my main PC and losing bookmarks wouldn't inconvenience me on it, but figured I'd ask here before.

1274301,2019-12-04 14:02:33 -0800,2019-12-06T17:38:45Z,What caused profiles to torque two days ago?,"<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask the question that comes at the end of this note.  If you scroll to the end, you can see it marked as MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
</p><p>As I was posting the question, I took advantage of the moment to reflect on the fact that FireFox's perseverance over its long history of ups and downs today has made FireFox one of the real hopes for humanity.  Long Live FireFox!
</p><p>Back in the dark ages, before the ascendance of Google's Chrome browser, I learned to recover FireFox's guts, to cope with its gastric spasms of projectile digital vomiting, which seemed to occur every few weeks.  Most software in those days contributed full shares to the unusable stew, made the accumulation of digital barf that needed cleanup as often as I needed to clean up after hangovers from over drinking when I was a stupid youth. Those were the days when running a computer all day without being forced to restart taught me to weild Windows Task Manager as weapon, which usually provided a side step around enough of the binary vomit top cut restarts from 4 a day to only one or two.
</p><p>Years later, while Microsoft was recovering from the largest, most expensive public mistake in software history (Windows 8), Google got a handle on Chrome.  After that, around 2014, Google either found Popeye's spinach factory, or aliens joined them in their Mountain View offices, because no human force can account for the rate and quality of significant upgrades to all their systems since then, for Chrome browser, underlying Chromium technology now used by everyone, not just for browsers, but all manor of application software to run on all kinds of platforms, Android for phones and apps, YouTube video processing that spots copyrighted sound and images in every video that has it, the world-leading advertising systems and dashboards, and their search engine so much better than anyone else's our choice is to use Google Search or be stupid and slow, or use Google Maps or be lost.  Google pumps out new and better software features one hundred times faster than any other organization.  If you missed the media reports explaining this, that is because Google's super productivity has not been celebrated in anything like the degree warranted. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, Google also has become so evil  it probably cannot be prevented from destroying the system of human checks and balances invented in the United States 240 years ago. As simple and feeble as those checks and balances are, without them it is hard to see how any substantial part of the human population ever could have experienced and lived with Liberty and the productivity it makes possible.  For example, without the Liberty growing throughout the world after taking its initial root in the United States and our written Constitution, one of the most ingenious and consequential documents ever written, the normal result of military conflict would have been one murderous, tyrannical, wholly self-serving dictatorship or another forcing 99% of the human population to live as serfs or politicians in the involuntary service of people like you know who.  Google and the rest of the power players in commercial media are destroying that, through political bias they lie about.  The problem with their lies is they have the power of their media platform to perpetrate them.  Google is evil and needs to be neutralized.  The main thing I can do about this is to stop using their products.  The other thing I can do is tell people about what is happening.  I was raised to see things this way, but for until recently, I did not see this is the way we have to look at things because this is the way that works.  Until recently, I did not know society cannot stop functioning, but now I know that the functioning we all take for granted, including the people fighting against it, is rare as diamonds when viewed in the context of human history, Some of the people attacking our country want to break it down, because they want the United States to become like the places people now leave in order to come here.  The sickness is the same that has affected all gluttons for power.  They have learned that force of military arms tends to galvanize people like you and me.  Instead, they lie to us. pretending to harbor the same loves for life you and I have, when in truth they see us is idiot patsies, making us deserve their the damages wrought by their treachery.
</p><p>Therefore, I stopped using Chrome, returning to the FireFox way of browsing.  I was with Chrome so long, I forgot all about recovering browser profiles.  FireFox is a lot more reliable today than it was before Chome blew everybody out of the water, but its profile system still ha regular bouts with projectile digital vomiting.
</p><p>Today, my FireFox is not blasting bile all over the house, but is being rather brave holding the contagion within itself. I noticed passwords not filling into web forms that used to be there. I am not sure of the timing.  I probably was a long time ago, but I kept getting messages from FireFox babbling about their new security system.
</p><p>Today, I needed to identify active profile (i.e., the one I use) from the half dozen profiles piled into my FireFox installation.  I don't know why there is more than one.  Unfortunately, I just could not glean the one I need to look at from their names:
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p>The online guide provided the usual waste of time.  I asked the computer how to know which profile is the active one.  I immediately found thousands of articles which each spell out the same eight or ten reasons why a person might wish to know which profile is active. The people writing these articles know their articles are filled mostly with spam (information we already have or don't need), but their editors are evaluated on word count, needed for diluting the concentration of ads in their publication.  It's been years since the ANSWERS were easy to pick out of spam portions of the articles they appear with.  From this agony-inducing swill I found information that looked like it might tell me how to spot the active profile.  ""Look for "".default"" as part of the profile name.  So I looked again,
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p><br>
All of the profile names contain "".default.""
</p><p><br>
MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
Then I noticed the dates
</p><p>Months ago   b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
Months ago   n34593ht.default-release/
Two days ago   n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
Today  q412vz1p.default/
</p><p>Evidently, two days ago, FireFox ditched my profile and gave me a new one.  This leads to my question, my reason for posting this thread:
</p><p>Why?
</p><p>In other words, 
</p><p>Why did FireFox ditch my profile and give me a new two days ago?

Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560.
</p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices. Re-Installing the G560 drivers does not change anything.
</p><p>So if I wanna have any sound in Firefox I am depending on the error message popping up... which happens only rarely. But that can't be the solution :( It seems to me the problem is with Firefox, in the way it handles the sound channel or content or whatever... and does not recognize my G560 via USB as speaker system. Even though it is the only one set active in my system.
</p><p>I am really looking for any help and input to solve this please... !

Clicking the Firefox icon in Windows 10 (whether that's in the Start menu, the taskbar or the app itself in Program Files) won't launch Firefox. The blue loading spinner appears briefly next to the pointer, then disappears. Sometimes a Firefox process appears in Task Manager then instantly disappears, but sometimes it doesn't. Here's what I've tried so far:
</p><p>- Restarting
- Reinstalling
- Deleting my Firefox profile and all Firefox app files
- Launching in safe mode by holding shift
- Launching in safe mode by adding the ""-safe-mode"" comment
- Running as administrator
- Checking it's not being blocked by antivirus
- Loading the Firefox profile manager by typing ""firefox.exe -P"" in the run dialog box. This does the same as trying to load Firefox - nothing happens
</p><p>I can't think what else to do. It may be a coincidence, but my primary monitor died, I restarted the PC and then Firefox wouldn't work. I can't see how it could be related, but who knows.

Have tried customise toolbar not there,"<p>I have Firefox 70.0.1 (64-bit) running on Windows 10 Pro. I recently added several addons to firefox on a fresh install (new laptop) prior to syncing to my account from another PC, but despite appearing on the list of addons as enabled, (and all having worked for me previously on my old laptop) the new extensions do not appear in my toolbar or on the list of items to include in the toolbar when I click on customize. I have closed and restarted both firefox and my machine, and removed and reinstalled the addons several times but none of this has helped. I also synced my account and  clicked the include addons checkbox and this did not help either.
