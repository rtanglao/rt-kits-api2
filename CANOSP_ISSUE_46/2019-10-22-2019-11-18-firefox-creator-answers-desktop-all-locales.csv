The issue seems to not be tied to the link itself; if I track down the same link in my feed, I can click it again and it loads with no problems. Furthermore, the issue has occurred on both my laptop and my desktop. I've also encountered it on two different Wi-Fi networks. I think there is something wrong with the Firefox browser itself. I am using the current version.

</p><p>I'm still using an older version of firefox to keep essential add-ons that Quantum no longer had.  I'm having problems on a windows 7 computer with the version I have on it, and would like advice on the best way to proceed.  
</p><p>I had copied over my profile from a different computer where I'd been using FF55.  I'd had some problems with 55, so I installed 52 on this computer, but using that profile.  It's not working very well as I can't get vertical tabs or vertical tabs reloaded to work, it's also crashing fairly often for no apparent reason, etc.  Now even the ""+"" symbol to add a new tab has disappeared from the tab bar, and I don't have a clue why or how to get it back!).  For what it's worth, this isn't a malware/virus problem - I'm running McAfee and also periodically malwarebytes etc., and scans aren't finding problems. Computer has been restarted several times and so on, and I'm still having the problems.  Could this be because the profile was from a firefox 55 version and it's being used on a FF52 version? Or would that not cause this sort of problem?
</p><p>I don't want to go to 56 because I gather it won't be able to access my older saved sessions (I use Session Manager and those are the sessions I'm concerned about - so if this is NOT a problem, please let me know).  I'm concerned about this because wiki says:  ""...Another change was the introduction of the mozlz4 format, a proprietary variant of the lz4 compression format (.mozlz4 and .jsonlz4 file extensions instead of .json.lz4 as per unix/linux standard). Session data is stored in the lz4 format instead of plain text. Firefox 56 can not recognize the legacy plain text session files, only the lz4-encoded ones....""
</p><p>So I'm wondering if I should go to 55 on this computer, or 52ESR?  I gather the ESR would have better security - but want to know if there's a difference in add-on compatibility or other features since 52ESR is, I gather, based on older code than 55?
</p><p>If someone could talk me thru the pros and cons of using 55 versus 52ESR I'd sure appreciate it!!!
</p><p>Also, I would be VERY grateful if folks could point me towards:
1. a reasonably safe site where we can search and install legacy add-ons
2. any webpage which has a good information showing which legacy add-ons now have reasonable replacements in the current FF version.

I noticed this issue quite a few times: When I open the cookies privacy settings, the two buttons ""Clear Data"" and ""Manage Data"" often appear grayed out.
I don't use private browsing or disabled offline cache like I saw in other threads, and I use only 4 regular extensions.
The funny thing is that the buttons become functional on their own after a couple of minutes if I just leave the tab open.
So it seems that Firefox is running some very long process before enabling these buttons the first time the settings page is opened.
If I close the privacy settings tab and open it again, then these two buttons immediately appear enabled, not grayed out.
</p><p>Firefox should probably change the very confusing and counter-intuitive way it is handling these two buttons, or at least display some animated icon to indicate it is doing some stuff, but if it's reading all cookies before deciding to enable the two buttons (and I don't think I have an unusual number of cookies), I'd rather have Firefox enable these buttons immediately and run this cookies analysis process AFTER I click on one of these two buttons, not before.
By the way, it would be great if the about:support page could provide the number of cookies or web sites with cookies so we might use this for technical support. I have no idea how many I have and if this number is a problem.
</p><p>In any case, for all other users that experience the grayed out cookie management buttons: Leave the settings tab open, do other stuff on Firefox or the computer, and come back to this settings tab after a few minutes, you'll find the two buttons enabled.

I have tried removing and re installing fire fox, I have my direct X up to date, i have adobe installed/ up to date. I downoo9aded the Microsoft media feature pack, I have tried disabling all my addons/ extensions nothing seems to work. If anyone could help me out that would be amazing. I really dont like google chromes set up but if that is the only way i can stream videos i might have to get used to it.

</p><p>Back in 2015, Mozilla destroyed the search bar by removing the text labels, making it almost impossible to search because you can't find the engine you want. They also removed the ability to switch engines, meaning you have to nominate your engine every single time you search.
</p><p>On top of this, Mozilla reversed the order you do things: It used to be that first you chose the type of content you wanted, then you thought about your exact query. But now, you first have to specify your exact query and THEN think about the type of content you want to search for, which is totally counter-intuitive and terrible interface design. It's like being asked for the name of the meal, movie or book you want, before you've even decided whether you want a meal, movie or book!
</p><p>The reason Mozilla gave for these awful changes was to ""make searching faster"", but that simply is not the case. The new search bar requires just as many clicks, yet it's drastically slower to use as it's almost impossible to find the engine you're looking for from all the unlabeled engines. Plus, having to type your query first is completely counterintuitive to the user's thought process and slows things down even further.
</p><p>Solution:
</p><p>For a couple of years, Classic Theme Restorer was the perfect solution, bringing back the old bar exactly as it should be. However, since Firefox Quantum, Classic Theme Restorer doesn't work, so I've been using Jefferson Scher's excellent userchrome script. (Thank you Mr Scher!)
</p><p>Sadly, with Firefox 70, the script seems to be broken again and many of the engines are missing from the list. I've tried taking the script directly from Jefferson Scher's website, but doing so just makes text labels disappear. It just seems to be broken again.

It is a good system as designed - but I found that one of my W10 PCs had only two backups, and all of them had huge gaps in the saved-bookmark dates. A few sequential, then a gap of weeks or months and another set - but hardly any more than two days in a row. And old backups are pretty useless to me.
This is odd because have been I using FF as my main browser for a while now - I would expect consistent backing up every day.
So why are the backups so unreliable? Is there anything I can do to make sure FF backs up every day (like it is supposed to!) ? My FF installs are kept up to date. 
It is a worry, any suggestions/explanations most welcome!

""Using an older version of Firefox can corrupt bookmarks and browsing history already saved to an existing Firefox profile. To protect your information, create a new profile for this installation of Firefox.""
Because I am forced to create a new profile I can´t access the original profile with the certificate I need. 
I tried going to about:profiles and setting as default to no avail several times.
I have tried the firefox.exe -P command as well. 
I can´t import the cert9.db file to the certificates setting. I also tried moving the cert9 file to another profile while Firefox is closed but I because I must create a new profile when I open it again and can´t switch profiles once its open it doesn´t make a difference. I´m running out of ideas and it was such a hassle to get the certificate in the first place I can´t afford to lose it. 
Is there another way around creating a new profile? Or anything I´m not considering?

I transferred the profile from the Windows machine to the Linux machine and everything came over perfectly. But the passwords are not offered after selecting a login.
Example: There is a page with ""login"" and ""password"". I have two accounts for this page. I click into ""login"" and both login-names are offered by firefox. I select one account. Now I'd expect that the password is filled automatically. But it isn't. Even if I click also into the ""password"" field. The same with pages where I have only one account.

</p><p>Finally decided to make a topic about it as all of my attempts in the past few months to fix it have been in vain.
Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally.
</p><p>I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed.
</p><p>The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it.
</p><p>(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text)
</p><p>From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates.
</p><p>Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here?
</p><p>Thanks in advance,
Rasmus

I was taken to an App called ""Authy"".
After spending ten minutes filling in all the crap they want for me to establish an account, I added them to 1Password and opened the application.  The FIRST instruction is for the User to ADD the site they will be using Authy to retrieve an Authentication Code in order to log into Firefox.  I typed in Firefox and you are NOT in their list of supported applications.  Facebook, Twitter, Chrome, etc. are all there.  Moreover, I could NOT add Firefox as one of their supported applications.  I had to submit a request.
Did it EVER occur to the Firefox Developers that maybe before you throw up a list of Authenticator Apps that support FireFox, that you first determine if they actually do????????    This is sixth grade coding and a waste of thirty minutes.  It makes me question if any of the supposed features in your browser are anything more than ""Vaporware"".    Listed features that are supposedly running in the background, but actually aren't even coded in.  
I'll skip your security features since its obvious you don't have a clue how to implement them, or they are just there for another type of ""fake marketing scheme"".   
The attachments ARE from the downloaded application, yet there is NOTHING for me to input in Setup04  Attachment Pic, because I can't create an account that is tied to Firefox.

</p><p>Hi there,
</p><p>Thanks for writing in! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble.
</p><p>I believe this is an issue of your browser blocking multiple download from the same site. I have attempted the bulk downloader myself on Chrome and had success with the bundle you mentioned, so that is the only factor I believe may be holding you back. There is an article regarding this issue for the Firefox browser here:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075</a>
</p><p>Installing that add-on may help you correctly download the products in question.
</p><p>If you continue having trouble, let me know and I can discuss this issue with my team further. We may not be able to provide an immediate solution, but we can hopefully address this issue in future updates to this feature.
</p><p>Kind regards,
</p><p>-Finn

<p>Funny, so I try downgrading Flash via YUM, which can't be done as Adobe promptly removes old versions from its repos.
OK, so I just YUM erase Flash, only to achieve an INVALID IcedTea plugin. What?
</p><p>Did I perhaps use FF 68.2 for 2 weeks without noticing the issue? Well if that's the case a downgrade to 68.1 will fix things, right?
So I re-add via YUM the latest Flash plugin, but alas 68.1 still thinks that and IcedTea are INVALID.
</p><p>Mumble. Well let me get the big hammer and further downgrade to FF 60.9, remove pluginreg.dat, fire FF up again and... oh. Still INVALID. Now I'm 100% sure there's something weird - but what is it?

Audio is fine in general.
However, when I try to skip ahead in a video (YouTube, e.g.), I can hear a very small but audible ""pop"" sound from my headphone, which is super annoying.
My UNEDUCATED guess is my headphone seems to turn off instantly when the video starts buffering, and then turn back on again when buffering is done.
Any idea I can deal with this issue?

I have tested Edge, Opera, and Chrome.
Edge is behaving the same way as Firefox does.
Chrome and Opera is fine without that ""pop"" sound when skipping video ahead.

With Javascript, I change divs, tables, &amp;c., from display:none to, e.g., display:block.  All the attributes work EXCEPT the background image.  So, for example, if background color is #000000, the background shows solid black, and if I change that ahead of time or even on the fly to, e.g., #FF0000, the background changes onclick to solid red.  But, the background image appears pretty much at random as the computer pleases.  So, for example, the background-image is set by css for a table where display:none is the setting.  The template changes the table to display:inline-block.  The table appears, the background color appears, but often no background image appears UNLESS I open the console and uncheck, then recheck some property, e.g., height, associated with the background image.  If, however, I set the initial table property to, e.g., display:inline, the initial result shows a bunch of garbage, but once the display is switched to inline-block, all the background images appear normally and regularly.  This appears to be some kind of bug with Firefox, but for the life of me, I cannot fix it.  If the display of an element -- article, div, table -- starts in the css as ""none,"" the background image often does not appear when display is switched on.

Frustrated, i decided to fully uninstal and download and re-install afreash. However, after doubleclicking the .exe Firefox install file the process stalls after unpacking saying ""You may not have the necessary permissions to use all the features of the program you are about to run. You may run this program as  a different user or continue to run the program as the current user."" The two options are; run as current user or run as administrator (with associated password field). Choosing the first option then stalls the instal process. Choosing the second option there is a login or password conflict, even though the current user 'is' the administrator account.

Today I realized that recent bookmarks were not loaded on the  ESR; I checked in the preference/Sync and I was apparently logged. Because I wanted to ""force"" the sync I log-out and then tried to log-in. The I realized that it was impossible to log in again because ""no connection available. You need internet to log in"". Of course ESR has no problem in whatsover other page, just in the login page.
Final step was to see if th the FF/sync was working in the new mac and then the number of connected devices to this account: the message I got is that ESR associated but the last time it was active was one month ago. Meaning that ESR lost the ability to sync (w/o any alert) one month ago.
It is just me or the sync is deprecated for good in ESR machine?

This problem usually happens to me over google. When click to a different web page on Google, i can't go back to the google search page. It's happened a couple of times on other sites. But it doesn't always happen. I remember there was no such problem before the update (btw not sure). I really dont get it what's the problem. When this happens return(previous) button being deactivated.

I am running current Firefox on current W10 64bit 1903 desktop PC using Ethernet with Spectrum as my ISP.  I am having a couple of problems in Firefox that are not happening in current Chrome.  1.  Page-not-found 2-8 times a day that resolve every time by simply clicking the ""retry"" (or something close to that) button.   I reset my router to ""factory"" and installed most current router firmware but that did not help.  Netgear Support has been unable to help.  2.  In current LastPass addon, I have to re-login to LastPass every time I start Firefox - did not used to do that (a year ago), and in Chrome or Edge that does not happen.   I have re-installed the LastPass add-on.  I have upgraded Firefox many times and have cleared history/cache many times.  
So now I want to COMPLETELY remove Firefox, reboot,  and then install Firefox from scratch.  Can someone please point me to the web page that tells me how to properly remove all of Firefox so that I can re-download/install it from the beginning?  I do not care about retaining my Firefox settings or other from my current Firefox install.

</p><p>La única diferencia entre uno y el otro es que uno ejecuta el perfil home y el otro ejecuta el perfil work y cada uno tiene sus menus contextuales para gnome por separado para cada perfil.
</p><p>Entonces, desde el menú de gnome3 he agregado ambos accesos de firefox y funcionan muy bien, cuando hago click sobre el ícono firefox home inicia firefox con el perfil personal y cuando hago click a firefox work me aparece el perfil de trabaj con las pestañas, archivos y accesos del trabajo.
</p><p>El problema es que cuando inicio firefox este no mantiene el contexto de ejecución de la aplicación en el ícono de gnome, se crea un tercer ícono de firefox en el menú lateral y cuando inicio los dos perfiles estos se mezclan en este mismo tercer ícono.
</p><p>¿Porqué sucede esto?, ¿Cómo puedo hacer para que la ejecución de firefox quede asociada al ícono que lo ejecuta solamente?
</p><p>Por otro lado, no sería mala idea que Firefox pudiera utilizar de manera mas cómoda los perfiles y poder intercambiar entre uno y otro. Antiguamente usaba los grupos de pestaña para englobar mis pestañas del trabajo y los personales, pero desde que los eliminaron que he tenido que mezclar todo y uso muchas pestañas y se me hace un desorden, los grupos de pestaña eran una genialidad y me ayudaba a ordenar y separar todo. Así como lo hace Android por ejemplo que es capaz de mantener perfiles de trabajo y separar la ejecución de una misma app en dos contextos (trabajo y personal) en dos iconos separados (uno con una insignia de maletín), asi mismo sería genial que firefox tuviera la posibilidad de crear perfiles dentro del mismo navegador y poder acceder a estos perfiles a traves de accesos directos diferentes con insignias definidas por el usuario, talves de una lista pequeña de insignias que sean nativas de firefox, asi podriamos tener perfiles de pentetsing, desarrollo, personal, trabajo, etc. Me dirás ¿porqué no hacer todo eso en un mismo perfil?: porque por ejemplo para desarrollo uso github, para el trabajo tambien y cada ves que trabajo debo cambiar de cuenta, estar cerrando sesion y luego a la noche estar volviendo a iniciar sesion con mis cuentas personales, algo similar le pasa a la gente que usa facebook web de manera personal y para sus pequeñas empresas, por ejemplo conozco a gente que debe usar chrome y firefox al mismo tiempo para poder usar dos perfiles de facebook a la ves.

</p><p>As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css (see below for more info) that reduce the width of the address bar once placed in the Firefox <em>Profile</em> folder. In order to do that create a Folder named <em>chrome</em> on the desktop. Step two: Create a .TXT file, rename the Extention from <em>.txt</em> to <em>css</em> rename it <em>userChrome.css"" and place into the </em>Profile<em> folder with the following Code 
</em>
</p>
<pre>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keyoligarch/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keyoligarch/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>""); /* numbers are adjustable */

#search-container { max-width: 200px !important; }</pre>
<p>In order to Locate the folder, 
If your Firefox was installed by .EXE file the <em>Profiles"" folder will not the Program Files Folder (In order to locate it 1. Hit the Windows button Lower left 2. Hit </em>This PC<em> 3. Locate C Drive 4. Go to Users, Find the name you named your PC 4. AppData 5. Roaming 6. Mozilla 7. Firefox 8. Profiles) unless you are using the </em>Portable version"" in which case the <em>Profile</em> folder is in the <em>Data</em> Folder.   Or just search for <em>Mozilla"" to find the Data folder from there, then open the Profile folder. 
</em>
</p><p>The scripts still works, again as mentioned on the 1st line of this post, As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css. So you will have to enable it to do so, or it won't work. In order to do that 
(1) Open a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.
(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste the word <em>userprof</em> if it's disabled, double click it to enable it. 
(3) In the search box above the list, search for <em>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</em> preference is not already set to true, double-click it to switch the value from false to true.
</p><p>(4) Close Mozilla Firefox 
(5) Insert the <em>chrome</em> folder you created it into the Firefox Profile folder (Tips on how to find that folder, above).
(6) Insert the userChrome.css file with the code in it (Instructions above) into the chrome folder in Profile folder. 
(7) Open Firefox.
</p><p>Sidenotes. The numbers located in the userChrome.css file are adjustable. If your URL/Adress Bar are too long or short,
lower the number incrementally to suite your preference. This is a working Tutorial as of Firefox 70.0.01 
</p><p>I thought i'd take time to create this because I had much difficulty trying to find the solution. Hope this helps.

This is happening on my Win10 machine - my Win7 box is not having any issues since the update.
</p><p>I have followed the advice of creating new profiles, checking for locked profiles (and being unable to remove the lock?).  I have completely removed Firefox from my system - uninstalled via control panel, deleted all folders in Program Files and Users etc, removed temp files and edited the registry to completely remove any Mozilla/Firefox entries.  Completely clean install - as far as I can tell - but the problem re-appears as soon as Firefox is reinstalled.  I've tried all this in WIn10 safe mode as well but still no joy.
</p><p>The issue seems to be that there is a process running that cannot be terminated but I'm unable to kill the single remaining Firefox.exe process listed in task manager.  When I try 'taskkilll /IM firefox.exe /F' from the command prompt I get an error that the process can't be killed as an instance of it does not exist.  If I try 'taskkill /IM firefox.exe /T /F' it advises that a child process is keeping the main process alive - explorer.exe.  Terminating explorer.exe does not free up the firefox.exe process for termination (same error of the instance not existing).  The only way to clear the process is to reboot my system, Firefox will then start ok but when closed the issue will occur again.
</p><p>I'm on my 4th clean install and the issue persists, so any help or advice beyond what I've tried would be appreciated.

<p>This has NEVER happened before. Some of those also don't work/function on Chrome. It obviously isn't my clock, it's either Facebook &amp; other sites running the videos &amp; games or a certain site running them. The first sentence said (after the Did Not Connect part) makes it sound like YOU/Mozilla stopped it from working or going to the site, even though it's clearly the site itself that doesn't work in general (maybe from that expired certificate, NOT because it's an hour off LOL, OR they got attacked with malware like some others in past months). At least I know it's not just me that can't use those apps for now.

</p><p>This isn't what I want, because I do want to be updating Firefox regularly, but I do not want it to interrupt things I am in the middle of working on to do it by *refusing to load pages* until I restart it.
</p><p>This is a nightmare when working on things that require multiple tabs, or worse when I'm submitting something via a form as this restart page and forced restart destroys what I was doing.
</p><p>I would be happy for it to automatically install the update on next restart. I will tolerate nag screens to remind me to restart the browser as soon as is practical. I *cannot* tolerate it absolutely ruining what I was doing by suddenly showing a demand to restart instead of the page I just submitted, or having something half written I need to check something for in another tab to find that I cannot do that and so cannot finish what I was doing before restarting.
</p><p>This update process is hostile, and disabling updates entirely is not at all what I want to do, I just want to control where my workflow is interrupted and avoid LOSS of work. But I can only seem to find the extreme options of no updates at all, or automatic updates that will randomly ruin what I am doing.
</p><p>If this is the new reality for Firefox I'll have to find something else to use, but having spent several hours trying to find a fix for this - and this not being the first time I looked as this has impacted me several times previously - even if there is a workaround it's incredibly poor form to not allow this option in a simple manner or to have such information easy to find.

I am trying to find the history of a specific URL, like the last time I opened it yesterday, but it seems that the most information History records or shows is the last time I opened it (today) and the total number of times I accessed this URL (4). I can't find any actual history of this URL in the History library. Am I missing something, or does the History feature record only the last access?
This would be very bad and a far cry from any kind of history.
Also, the Search feature does not seem to take into account the range of dates selected in the left pane. For instance, if I select ""September"" and search for my URL, it returns the URL that I accessed in November and that didn't even exist in September. The Search feature could be a little more contextual, and work on the whole history only if the root ""History"" folder is selected. But that's aside the main question, how to find the full history of a specific URL, not just its last access time.
Thanks.

I tried the device management in my account page, but I can't see anything on my new PC except itself, meanwhile I can see my old PC and iPhone itself on my iOS Firefox. I tried to re-sign in on my iPhone, and shockingly found that I can only use my old password to successfully sign in, the new password working on my new PC is a wrong one for my phone.
Then I tried to delete the account with new password on PC. After delete successful, sign in on my PC with that E-mail was correctly reported as ""unknown account"", but I can still sign in with the exact same E-mail and the old password on my phone, like nothing happened at all. At the same time, even if I tried the exact same combination of E-mail and old password on PC, the result is always ""unknown account"", like it already be deleted.

</p><p>My first time here, just recently switched from Chrome to Firefox, but seems like it's a bit problematic. 
Version 70.0 worked fine, but ever since 70.0.1, Firefox starts crashing (randomly). 99% of the time there is no error message, the browser just crashes(closes) and that's it, no crash report, no error, the only thing I can do is to restore previous session. Usually, after crashing, it will crash again 2-3 times upon opening the browser, until it will finally work...for a while. 
Rarely there have been errors, saying the same thing - memory could not be read (attached in the post). Does not happen with any other browsers. All my drivers and software are up to date, memory is OK, (did windows memory diag and memtest86), hardware is okay, tried disabling plugins and hardware acceleration, still nothing. All that ever since 70.0.1, before that it worked fine. Is it just me or anyone else having that problem? 
If any additional info is needed, let me know.

</p><p>I do the IT support for my dad (85+ years): 
Firefox 70.0.1 64 bit on Windows 10 Home 64 bit, all up to date.
He has various passwords saved in FF, but I specifically instructed FF to exempt the sites he uses for Online Banking sites from saving passwords. 
</p><pre>  ""Access &amp; Passwords"" &gt; Exceptions: sites listed (entered by clicking ""NEVER save"" when asked on login). 
</pre>
<p>I have FF delete all data upon closure: 
</p><pre>  ""Delete history when FF is closed"" all EXCEPT for ""Website Settings"" (which I learned would also kill the password save barrier)
</pre>
<p>Now, I don't know what my dad does; every time I check after a week these settings are gone and FF is happily back, offering the saved login details to his Online Banking sites, also the Exception list is empty. My dad cannot say what he did to change this and maintains ""he didn't do anything"" (see also: typical IT support customer statements). 
Sometimes I find he has even reinstalled FF for no good reason (which I can see in the Apps bar). But this should not affect the Profile settings, and even if he should have agreed to delete profile data: the bookmarks are still there, so it's not all gone. 
</p><p>For now I have deactivated FF from saving any passwords, which is the safe choice when Online Banking is involved (no, my dad won't agree to close the Online Banking Account altogether go to the bank). But this creates new problems with all the other less sensitive sites where he needs to enter passwords (newspaper sites etc.), which he misplaces and keeps on resetting them (to passwords which he will again not remember the next time round). 
</p><p>My next thought was to set permissions.sqlite to read-only, as I found this is where FF stores the exception list. Unfortunately, I realized that FF apparently updates this file every time it's run and ignores it if it finds it is out of sync with what it expects, returning to the clear sheet. So this doesn't help. 
</p><p>I guess I could set up an autorun batch file to delete the profile directory and restore a golden reference directory, but this could be error-prone too. 
</p><p>So I was wondering if the community can point me to a way to permanently fix a given list of Password-Save-Exceptions which cannot be altered by the user? Something like a config setting, available or hidden? 
</p><p>Thanks for any advice or pointers,

I had inadvertently removed my bookmark webpage star from my browser (Firefox v.70).  I searched and couldn't find an answer as to how to get it back on my address bar.  The closest answer involved clicking the ""Page actions"" (which looks like an ellipses; 3 dots) button which is adjacent to the bookmark webpage star button by default.  Both were missing from my address bar.

Refresh the browser.
Right-click on an empty area of whatever webpage.
A context menu will popup with a star that appears in the upper right side of that popup window.  
Make your new bookmark and click ""Done"".

After browsing for a while when I open a new tab and try to load a web page large parts of Firefox become unresponsive, for example I can close other tabs, move tabs, use websites in other Firefox windows largely unaffected but I cannot view other tabs in the window I opened the crashing tab. The unresponsive tab just sits there with a loading animation in the tab name, white screen, what ever website I tried to visit cleared from the address bar.
</p><p>Opening additional tabs is possible but the crashing window will not switch to those tabs, while in another window I can open a new tab but actually visiting a site or opening a link in a new tab will crash that window. 
</p><p>Opening new windows once I'm crashing results in a crashed window regardless if I use the empty page or load a URL.
</p><p>Lastly if I click on a link before a tab crashes nothing will happen. No tab will open, no tabs will crash, the link won't turn purple. But at this point I can go fully about my business reading the existing loaded content in all my working tabs and windows. Opening the link in a new tab with context menus will crash the new tab immediately.
</p><p>Once a tab has crashed I am forced to close the browser. It usually takes a while to fully shutdown, but it's never unresponsive enough to need to be killed in the Task Manager.
</p><p>And sometimes this entire process corrupts my profile and I get to re-login to everything on the web again.
</p><p>Now, here's the frustrating part. I don't know how to troubleshoot this. The issue has persisted through:
- Firefox versions 67, 68, and 70
- My machine was re-imaged with a new Windows image when I was upgraded to an SSD. The previous image didn't have Firefox preinstalled, the new image did(68). I purged that and installed 70 and the issue continues.
- I have disabled hardware acceleration multiple times(because my profile keeps getting reset).
- There are no crash logs.
- I haven't taken to time to reproduce the error with no extensions but I've A/B tested that I can crash running just uBlock or just Tusk. I'm not running a lot of extensions because the profile keeps getting reset.
- Firefox isn't actually crashing, no crash reports are being generated, Windows event log is clean.

There has GOT to be a better answer. It's been too many years of this making excuses.
</p><p>If nothing else, can't someone develop JUST a rinky dinky program/add-in that loops through all open pages one by one, closing, pausing while we check Taskman, then reopening so we can see the effect? That would be TRIVIAL for someone to write just that crude thing. But it would save people breathtaking amounts of time because we're having to do this manually, over and over and over and over and over. Even with this simple routine, it could be enhanced to record the CPU load from Taskman or TaskInfo or something, since we'd be slowly, ploddingly writing down or pasting the results as I stepped through the pages one by one.
</p><p>Better yet, ideally, just do this, which also should not be technically difficult - seriously. Take some unused field and populate it with identifying information (like the Save As name of the page), then inform Microsoft (for taskman, resmon) and Iars (for TaskInfo) where it is. Or write our own CPU monitor extract just to measure FX CPU, that displays which PID goes with which window)(s).
</p><p>THAT'S WHAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. An indication of which browser instances go with which PIDs. Even if there's some overlap, if PID 6632 is using an entire core and more of my desktop, if I can just even partially limit which browser windows are burning there, that would be enormous.
</p>
<pre>For example
PID....FX-ID
15......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
15......mozilla.com / (name of page, ...
15.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
25......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
25.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
33.....ameritrade.com / (name of page, ...
33.....yahoo.finance / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....goduckgo.com / (name of page, ...
etc.</pre>
<p>If the reason no one's done this is because there's more than one page associated with each PID, that's covered in the listing above. Just list what you know, every one of them. Do you see how powerful that would be, if we knew that PID 15 was shredding the CPU, and we could at least limit it to a limited number of possible criminal pages?
</p><p>I keep numerous windows open and like it or not the reality is that one or more of them are running obscenely rude loops to refresh the page or scan for input or whatever. I have a very well equipped desktop but it is hammered by one or more such sites. I and I am sure others have wasted hours and hours and hours hunting and pecking to diagnose this, and there's NO END to it, because there will continue to be piss poor webpages that suck CPU and disk. Even from <a href=""http://microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">microsoft.com</a>, as you surely know to be often the worst performers of all. I use NoScript but that is not perfect; you have to continuously adjust it for different sites, and you don't know WHICH sites need to be throttled down. It's wildly inefficient when we're shooting in the dark, because we DON'T KNOW WHICH BROWSER WINDOW is the jerkoff.
</p><p>BTW I have many WINDOWS open - almost never tabs. It is almost always massively more efficient than using tabs when you have many. Namely, with windows I can use Windows' own alt-tab, or click or hover the taskbar to navigate.
</p><p>I volunteer a lot of my time, a lot, both in technical areas and in personal charity. I'd do this myself, but I have no browser or HTML development background. Can't someone please come up with something? Asking for the millionth time, please? Sorry I'm getting nasty but there's all this senseless massive waste of time, and it will never go away - unless you heroically answer the call.

Have used it for quite a while and no problems printing either from online or from a desktop application. I am constantly printing PDFs from online -- e.g., receipts of bills paid, articles to do with my work, etc. In past, when I print a new PDF, it automatically opens, just like when printing from within desktop applications. This is a very necessary step in my work because of the volume that I print. I've been doing this for YEARS, and it has always worked. Now, suddenly, the PDFs no longer open upon printing from online (printing from desktop apps still works as expected). I have not personally changed any settings in either Firefox or Acrobat DC. But something must be different. Is it a glitch due to a Firefox update? Or could something have changed a setting for me?  
</p><p>As I said, I do a lot of my printing in volume, so this is becoming very frustrating as it means every time I print to PDF from online, I have to leave Firefox and go find the particular folder and make any necessary notations (or even just make sure the PDF created at all, before I dare leave the web site I've just printed from), vs. having the PDF right there in front of me immediately as has always been the case for years in the past.
</p><p>I've already posted to the Adobe forum, and no help has hit the money spot as yet. And, as I said, I've checked all my actual Acrobat settings, and they appear correct (plus, as I said, the PDFs do open automatically when I print from desktop applications).

Por favor, alguém pode me ajudar como resolver e inibir que o Windows faça essas alterações no meu PC?
Geralmente, essas atualizações acontecem quando eu ligo o PC. 
Inclusive, quando eu coloco algum bloqueador, o PC fica sem ligar as vezes, até que seja instalado todas as atualizações que o Windows 10 quer... Eu já pensei que fosse problema com fonte, memória, ou coisa do tipo.. mas não é.

</p><p>Nevertheless I notice that opening multiple tabs cause YouTube audio interruptions in the case that one of Firefox’s tabs is playing a video on YouTube.
Doing the same with Chrome doesn’t cause audio interruptions even opening a lot of tabs.
I think this is because hardware acceleration in Firefox isn’t working.
I think this because I see that the processor it is very loaded when opening multiple tabs of Firefox.
Processor is not very loaded opening multiple tabs of Chrome.
Am I right?
Why this problem doesn’t happen on Chrome?
How can I make Firefox like Chrome?

</p><p>However, when being authenticated for the /docs directory, the credentials are also sent when requesting /apex/ or /i/ URLS - thus disturbing the Oracle APEX Authentication (which uses cookies).

I got a message that due to changes in Firefox the Firefox profile cannot be used anymore. Then I copied the profile folder manually and checked profiles.ini, but no way. I found an Firefox help article how to copy several files manually to the new profile (""Recovering important data from an old profile""). This seems to be a workaround, but I'm not sure if it restores the Firefox profile completely, and it is unexpected additional work to complete the Windows Restore. 
So my questions: 
Is there an easier way to get the restored Firefox profile running? Firefox synchronization is not allowed due to company policies. 
What is the technical reason for not accepting copied profiles anymore? BTW, there is still an article in the Firefox help recommending this: Back up and restore information in Firefox profiles

For instance, I have a bookmark titled ""Snooker livestream"" but it does not appear when I type ""snooker"" in the ""Search bookmarks"" bar on top. Furthermore, I have also discovered that I am no longer able to remove bookmarks by right-clicking on them and pressing ""Delete"". I have attempted to do so when my account was synced as well as when it was not synced. I have read that it could be a ""syncing"" issue, but that does not appear to resolve the trouble.

With every new upgrade I HOPE it will fix the last problems, but MORE problems arise. The last straw was when I suddenly stopped being able to use my email. The reply/forward text boxes close up and disappear and I can't use my email with Firefox. It works with Chrome, IE, Opera &amp; even vivandi. Just not Firefox - ever since the last 2 upgrades. I can't view captcha boxes - don't even know they are supposed to be there until I get the error message that I can't get onto a certain page because the captcha failed. Have to switch to Chrome or Opera and start all over. So aggravating. Popup boxes I am supposed to get to fill in infor are grayed out and you can't type. Firefox has been impossible to use with everything. If I didn't have all my bookmarks saved, I'd delete it and not even bother. Is anyone else having these problems? Any fix other then the usual babble about reinstalling because that doesn't work. Using windows 7 home edition 64 bit. Upgraded to Firefox 70 32 bit and wish I could go back a few years to the old Firefox.

It would sometimes just vanish from the desktop, taking with it anything I happened to be typing into a browser window - forums, Facebook comment threads, anything. There are no error messages before or after or when I open the program again.  It just vanishes without warning. 
</p><p>I have had different ISPs, different computers, different OS's, and it ALWAYS does this. Days go by in between, sometimes just hours, but it's always done it. I switched to Safari for a while but I still like Firefox, so I came back, rationalizing that surely after many updates and months it must have been fixed. There is literally nothing the same on my current system - the OS is the latest. I use different software packages than I used to. The current Firefox installation is updated and running. And yet, it still just - vanishes. Randomly. No errors apparent. Nothing in the logs.
</p><p>The only thing in common over the years has been me - I'm just browsing the internet and using stuff. I have no idea what this could be.
</p><p>Before I abandon Firefox entirely I thought I would ask - is there something I am missing here? What the heck is going on that it keeps doing this to me? I don't have stray seizures that strike the command key and Q - my hardware works fine and the batteries in the keyboard are fresh, my aura doesn't disrupt other electronics, I don't have other people using my system, I've refreshed Firefox and scanned for viruses and malware and gremlins and pixies - what else can I possibly do to fix this randomly disappearing browser window issue? The entire program just quits and all the windows go away. POOF. If I restart it pops right back to the windows I was using and restarts, only without whatever I was typing at the time it vanished. It's the only software that does this to me. 
</p><p>It did it once while I was typing this on the support site.

Instead it prints the first, last, and sometimes one middle page.  The print preview function suffers the same error.

It doesn't seem to be a coding error in the web page as other browsers like IE, Chrome, and Opera render the page accurately.  Because I don't print pages often, I can't tell with what version the problem showed up.

Make these add ons better behaved. Show an indicator on the three bar menu icon, which already shows permission changes. I will get to it when free.  I want to choose when to view update info, and would be happy with a short update message with links to more info. Also would like to designate time of day or weekday that<strong>bold text</strong> Add Ons are allowed to update. Or have just one tab opened in the background where all such update messages appear. Also, as add-ons come in via Sync, do not default to adding to tool bar. That shrinks my URL text box at inopportune times.

I suspected these are simply the empty starting page and using a third party website to inspect the contents trhe suspicion turned out to be correct.
</p><p>So, what I'm wondering is are there any other older backup files saved anywhere in the FF folders that could be used instead? I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups. And further, is it possible to recover all those tabs and windows somehow if the only backup files are blank as I discovered? I have not closed FF after relaunching the first time after the crash in order not to create any more blank backups.
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any light you might be able to shed on this.

Question is can I get rid of Lockwise or it it built into FF?  Wish they (Firefox) had warned me about this when updating.   Then they are forcing me into having a Firefox account and trying their best to make me sync passwords which I don't want to sync anything.  Besides, I only use FF on this PC.  Mozilla is getting into too much cloud storing issues for me.
</p><p>Also, it seems FF started syncing just about all my data, passwords, bookmarks......... when I started an account.  I went into options and stopped by unchecking all they checked without asking and did a disconnect.   But there was a message that seem to say they already had sync and I couldn't delete their data they synced.

</p><p>Firefox 70 on a Fedora 30/31 KDE machine will freeze the entire machine within minutes (sometimes seconds) of launch.  A hard reboot is usually the only way to reset.  The issue is not associated with any particular URL.
</p><p>The System: 
</p><p>Operating System: Fedora 31 /
KDE Plasma Version: 5.16.5 /
KDE Frameworks Version: 5.61.0 /
Qt Version: 5.12.5 /
Kernel Version: 5.3.7-301.fc31.x86_64 /
OS Type: 64-bit /
Processors: 4 × Intel® Core™ i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz /
Memory: 7.7 GiB of RAM
</p><p>When It Started: 
</p><p>The problem began as soon as Firefox was updated to version 70 on the Fedora 30 installation.  I then upgraded Fedora itself to 31, but the Firefox problem persisted.
</p><p>What I have tried:
</p><p>1. I created a brand new user on the system and ran Firefox from that account.  Problem still exists.
</p><p>2. I launched Firefox from the command line in safe mode. Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ firefox -safe-mode
</pre>
<p>3. I launched Firefox with Wayland.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
</pre>
<p>4. I launched Firefox with X11.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-x11
</pre>
<p><br>
Something odd:
</p><p>The user agent string being presented by Firefox is inaccurate.  It is presenting itself as 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
</p><p>And yet this is definitely FF70 on Fedora, as I can attest to, unless I have gone insane and am not realizing it yet.   It particularly troubles me that I have to post this support request from a different browser (so disregard the auto-detected user agent associated with this post).  Oh, the humanity!

I have to use a custom built GStreamer based video decoder plugin and that is why I'm using v51. There are two screens each playing 4 streams each. The videos play at 30fps without any problem once displayed on browser. There is a switch button which can switch between 2 sets of 4 streams each (quad view). When the pages are switched, say for about 100-200 times, the responsiveness of the browser slows down gradually and at one point, it just stops to respond to any further clicks.  When Firefox froze, CPU utilization is about 30%, RAM about 25%.  
I tried to modify about:config parameters, but could not figure out which are the most relevant to my use case and the optimum values to be set. 
</p><p>I request community's help to identify the parameter combinations in v51.0.1 that could potentially keep Firefox from slowing down. In case more information is required, I will be glad to give them, but please suggest on how to get them out of the browser.

I hope someone can help!  I've tried everything.
</p><p>I’m using a desktop; Dell; newer. Windows 10; 1903; plenty of speed and space left.
No viruses, etc.; have done many scans (malwarebytes, adware, etc.) 
</p><p>For whatever reason (I think I incorrectly shut down Firefox and/or my computer, and that was the beginning of the problem), Firefox is causing lot of issues.
</p><p>Won’t open or close. followed all the advice on this site.
</p><p>Found out on this site to try ending Firefox in task manager; when that didn’t work; went in to and deleted parent.lock from the profile.
</p><p>Then rebooted the computer; still wouldn’t open (or did once, but then had the same problem?)
Tried shutting off the computer and restarting rather than rebooting many times during all this process as well.
</p><p>I followed what someone said about adding the word OLD after places.sqlite.
So in the original profile folder I have:
</p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD
    places.sqlite-shmOLD
    places.sqlite-walOLD
</pre>
<p>that didn’t help things.
Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’
</p><p>So I have:
</p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD
      prefs-1jsOLD
      prefs-2.jsOLD
      prefs-3.jsOLD
                  Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them
</pre>
<p>That didn’t help.
</p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop.
Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it.
</p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’).
</p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile. 
Same issues.
Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again.
Rebooted.
</p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open).
</p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox).
I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; …..
</p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile!
</p><p>The ‘default-release’ profile and the brand new one I created were never changed or touched; never added the word OLD to anything in there; made no changes.
</p><p>So Firefox wouldn’t close; so I had to do all of the above again (try to end task in task manager; delete parent.lock, and reboot).
</p><p>So now I’m at my wits end!!!
</p><p>I can’t find anything left to try.  : (
</p><p>I hope someone can help!

Since the GPU is non-metal I am forced to use Dark Mode, which turns the Firefox 68esr bookmarks/history sidebars (among other Firefox items) to almost unreadable black text on black background. Partial workaround I have found is this CSS, below, which works perfectly for the history sidebar, but not for the bookmarks sidebar. (Note, the same CSS works perfectly in Waterfox Classic, using Classic Theme Restorer, Custom CSS Code, for both history and bookmarks, where the different sidebars can be selected from buttons, instead of only from a dropdown in the FF68.)
</p><p>EDIT: PLEASE NOTE, after posting, the CSS is not formatted correctly. Not seeing any way to format as code, nor do I see any other formatting options for this original post. Several of the number/hash signs (#) are replaced by 1, which is not correct. Other formatting issues as well. PLEASE SEE SCREENSHOT OF CORRECTLY FORMATTED CSS:

a. saving the new firefox loader to my computer
b. Deleting the Firefox folder in Program files
c. Deleting the Mozilla ""upkeep"" files. (I can't actually remember the name of this folder)
d. fixing broken links in the registry.
e. reloading Firefox.

</p><p>Since release of the Firefox 70 I noticed that all FTP content opened via direct links is being saved right away, instead of being displayed. As I understand, this was done to close this ""bug"": <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699</a>. Though I guess this change can be beneficial for most users, it's also causing unnecessary problem to me a my colleagues at work.
</p><p>We are technical support team and we are working in the ticketing  system called BMC Remedy. All file attachments sent by our customers are uploaded to our internal FTP server and then linked to the tickets via direct FTP links. Before release of the 70th version it was very convenient for us to click on those files, and get files opened straight inside browser. It worked flawlessly, especially for image and text files and saved us a lot of time. It was also the main reason we used Firefox, since in Chrome always (at least recently) saved files instead of displaying them.
</p><p>But the release of 70th version messed up everything for us, and now all the files need to be saved before they can be opened which causes a lot of inconvenience. So much so, we had to downgrade back to 69th version to work normally.
</p><p>As I said at the beginning, I do understand the reason behind this change since FTP vulnerabilities can harm users on public websites. However, inside closed environments like intranets there is no such threats, and losing ability to quickly preview FTP resources can hurt productivity. So in my opinion, while it's a good idea to have this behavior enabled by default, there should be an option under about:config to enable rendering of the FTP resources back. Or maybe someone at least can make an extension or Greasemonkey script that would bring this functionality back.

Ich habe mir eine UserChrome.css gemacht, die gut funktioniert hat, dann kam Firefox 57? und die Anpassbarkeit war Geschichte.
Wer mit mehreren Tabs arbeitet und dafür sind die Tabs doch da, muss die Maus mehr bewegen und es ist unübersichtlich. Wäre es nicht sinnvoll, dass was ich am häufigsten benutze, in der Nähe der Arbeitsfläche zu haben? Wäre es nicht besser die Tab Leiste standardmäßig nach unten zu legen und wer es anders möchte, der kann sich alle 10 oder 15 Versionen, eine UserChrome.css basteln.

This LIVE DVD crashes or drops out from time to time so each time this happens I have to re-sync the Firefox it brings up.  This re-sync requires a verification code to be sent by email, but because that email has to go through my Google filtering process,  it usually takes longer than the code's 5 minute validity before I  receive it.   When I do finally get it and enter the received code back in Firefox,  I'm told the code is invalid or expired.   This is because 5 minutes validity is just too short a  time for my setup.  If it were 10 minutes, that would allow me to go into Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt;  Accounts &amp; Import -&gt; Check email from other accounts -&gt; and then order Gmail to perform a special immediate mailcheck on my selected account.   
As a slow elderly old codger myself,  I find it too hard to do all this within 5 minutes.  Why can't we make it 10 mins?

I find my access to Facebook content is completely blocked, whereas all other websites appear to be fine. Screenshot from one of the Facebook groups I follow is attached. I have spent hours trying to figure out your new security settings to enable access to Facebook, including switching off all blocking, and nothing is working, except to abandon Firefox and use Microsoft Edge (which is giving me perfect access). Also very ironically I have to use Microsoft Edge to log into Firefox support as Firefox tells me my cookies aren't enabled...except they are. I have been checking out Permissions to ensure everything is correctly enabled and I notice Load Images keeps reverting to Default rather than Enable – I don’t know if this is significant. At any rate Facebook images and data are not loading and it is clear all the pages are being blocked. I also wonder why my Avast online security is not being recognised by Firefox at the moment. I have been happy to use Firefox as my default browser for at least the last 10 years, but this is ridiculous, and I hope there is a simple solution to these issues or I will be changing to a different browser.

It's sluggish and its cursor focus behavior is enervating. I click a field and start typing, then Gmail, with its (or my computer's, or browser's) slowness takes a second or two to apply focus to its desired field, so it starts inputting my typing in the wrong field or worse, interpreting my inputs as actions (archiving, deleting, starring, muting conversations, opening chats, opening Google Tasks sidebar, deleting open draft, etc., really freaking messy). Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before.
</p><p>How can I prevent sites (or at least Gmail, specifically) from controlling/changing cursor focus? Is there an about:config key or an add-on for this, please?
</p><p>BTW, I don't mind Gmail and/or Firefox being a bit slow, I recognize I contribute to it by have a few add-ons installed and running (though not so many). What I don't want is Gmail choosing for me where my typing input is going.

At some point in the past few years, this setting disappeared from the up-front user option pages (but might still be around in some deeper, less-obvious setting as I have an older machine which still seems to honor its limit set long ago).
</p><p>Since I routinely have to purge the webpage cache in order to regain responsiveness and function of FF when my regular tabs remain open for most of the day, I would like to see this setting return to the user-option front pages -- or know where it is located in some deeper option page.
</p><p>More to the point, though, I would really like FF to constrain itself by design from bloating out on webpage cache -- reminds me too much of the 'memory leakage' problem which came to plague the Opera browser that I finally abandoned 10+ years ago for FF.  I realize that many website developers these days are enamored with the bells, whistles and flashy graphics needed to gain eyeballs and earn something from clicks and click-throughs, but the present-day notion of some endless user supply of RAM grates quite hard with someone of my vintage and experience with computers since the late 1960s.

Now I got a second laptop for work. I want to be able to send tabs from one laptop to the other via the ""send tab"" feature. So I obviously have to log into Firefox sync. But I DON'T want to have all my bookmarks, settings, history and especially extensions synced on my work laptop. Since I want to have a different set of bookmarks on my work laptop (related to work) I need to turn off the syncing of the bookmarks (unfortunately I don't  think it's possible to sync two different sets of bookmarks). Same goes for the extensions, settings and history. So long story short, I want to only use the send-tab feature, and to sync opened tabs. 
</p><p>Now here's the problem. When I log into Firefox sync after a fresh install on my work laptop and I enter my credentials, you are not asked what to sync. The default is to sync everything. After that everything is synced right away within a few seconds, and by the time I went to settings to turn the syncing of bookmarks, extensions etc. off, the bookmarks already synced and a ton of extensions start to appear. And probably all my settings that I don't want on my work laptop are synced, too. 
</p><p>Is there a way to choose what to sync BEFORE the syncing starts? That would actually be pretty smart...

</p><p>I'm experiencing multiple issues on Firefox and I'm wondering if these can be fixed, or I'm I'm better off re-installing. To wit:
</p><p>1) Certain sites have stopped loading properly. For instance until earlier today I could load Facebook with no problem, but now only the top blue menu bar will load; the rest of the page is blank white. Oftentimes this has happended with certain other sites; for instance I've not had full functionality on Vimeo or the New York Times' sites for a while. Until recently when I've had this issue with Facebook I've been able to clear the cache and re-load and that has been working, but today I tried this and now that solution doesn't work.
</p><p>2) Certain buttons don't function, such as video playback buttons on The Guardian's site, or certain playback and navigation buttons on Netflix. 
</p><p>3) I tired to log into my Firefox account and got the warning message ""Cookies and local storage are required. Please enable cookies and local storage in your browser to access Firefox Accounts. Doing so will enable functionality such as remembering you between sessions."" Cookies *are* enabled, however, and nothing seems to turn them back on. I've even tried trashing the cookies.sqlite file and re-starting, it doesn't help.
</p><p>I'm tempted to trash the whole install and start from scratch (I've been upgrading from one to the next for over ten years now), but I have thousands of bookmarks I want to preserve, plus many passwords, and now I cannot even log into my Firefox account on the  browser itself due to the erroneous ""cookies"" error massage to confirm that all my passwords are safely backed up. I've tried re-starting in safe mode with all plug-in disabled, and that did nothing to solve my problems.

All it did was open a video conversion website, which worked for the first video I tried (with alot of popups) but the second video I tried, it redirected me to a fake Firefox update page. 
As soon as I tried to cancel it, a login popup kept appearing and all my open tabs immediately went haywire trying to do some kind of redirect, and I it would not let me click on anything. I quickly ended the process to force close the browser, restarted Firefox and cleared my cache and uninstalled the extension. I am concerned about what kind of malware this may have installed on my machine. 
I reported this user over a month ago, but it is still available on the add-on page, and other people also commented about it having malware.
Any suggestions?

</p><p><br>
I have stumbled upon a weird issue and can't seem to solve it - some of the pages I visit seem to be blurry and lack sharpness in general. You can see it all on screenshots attached. This happens in different places, using gmail just as an example. I am currently typing this in a tab next to that gmail one, text and images here are in perfectly good shape. 
</p><p><br>
What I have already done:
</p><p>- forced my NVidia GPU to work with Firefox since I intially suspected that it might be an integrated Intel GPU that is causing this (I might've done something wrong so if you suspect this might be it - please elaborate on how I could address this);
</p><p>- double-checked font settings, zoom - all seems to be fine;
</p><p>- reset ClearText settings;
</p><p>- checked if this presists on an external monitor - it does.
</p><p><br>
I am not claiming this just started happening after the last update: I haven't used Firefox for some good time and am now considering switching back. Version is included on screenshots just for reference. I am currently on 70.0 (64-bit). 
</p><p><br>
Any input would be immensly appreciated!
</p><p><br>
Thanks in advance.

I'd guess 6+ seconds?  The loading icon on the tab will move, but there is no network activity indicated at the bottom of the window nor in the Network Monitor (ctrl+shift+e) until after a few seconds.  Once this delay period has passed, all pages load as normal.  It does this every time, without fail, even in safe mode.  I am using the 64-bit version but also had a 32-bit version still installed, so I decided to launch that version instead, since it still uses my profile and so everything should otherwise be the same.  This version did not have the delay.  I was able to load a webpage immediately.  I have deleted this 32-bit version, thinking it may be interfering somehow (perhaps because using the same profile? idk), but it changed nothing.  I can't imagine how the 64-bit version would perform worse than the 32-bit, so I don't just assume switch over.  I'd like to continue with the 64-bit version, as I have sufficient RAM to make use of it.  I've tried a good handful of solutions, but nothing.  Any ideas?  I've included troubleshooting info, in case that's useful at all.

</p><p>Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search. It wasn't there the last time I reviewed addons (which I do frequently, trying to find the best addon's for my usage) and I hadn't installed anything new recently. Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.
</p><p>I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. 
</p><p>It is not in the Control Panel. 
It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder.  
Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.
I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. 
It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.

Sometimes (not always) when I restart the pc and open firefox some extensions are completely frozen (mainly LastPass) and some tabs as well (usually Youtube or other Google related pages). Cleaning the browser cache never helps.
If I restart firefox in temp mode (extensions disabled) all is good, but when I restart it in normal mode the issue is there again. I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves. 
Any idea what could be causing this? A particular extension? I don't have many installed (I attach a screenshot of my current ones).

Since a recent update, I can no longer log in to various web sites.  The exact problem differs from site to site but ultimately Firefox just doesn't want to log in to sites. I also had an issue trying to create a Firefox login as the Firefox website told me to enable cookies even though they were already enabled; I'm currently using Safari.
</p><p>Specific examples:
Ebay: clicked ""Sign In"" button, entered username but Continue button remains greyed out.
YouTube: clicking Sign In button does nothing.
Hotmail: I can enter my username, then on the next page enter my password, but the next page is just the blue Outlook envelope.
I have cleared the cache and restarted Firefox several times.

Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.
</p><p>Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.
</p><p>In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.
</p><p>Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.
</p><p>Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.
</p><p>Many Thanks.
</p><p>P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means.

</p><p>Well it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. 
</p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. 
</p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. 
</p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!
</p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.

Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. 
</p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time.

This generally works very well.
</p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.  I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.
</p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.
</p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.
</p><p>I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.
</p><p>Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile?

That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.
</p><p>Admit you ""jumped the gun"" and do the right thing by us.

I changed my primary email address at a time, when Firefox Sync did not support changing email addresses.
I now checked to see if changing email addresses was possible and indeed, you can now add a secondary email address and switch it to be the primary one. So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".
I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.
</p><p>Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?
</p><p>If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?
