I have no idea if there is a separate new installation (I can't find it on my C: drive, just the one installation) and I will lose a lot of information if I close the old application and the new one pops up.  I suppose the question boil down to, first, how do I get back to the old version, or how can I synchronize without a smartphone?  This has to be the most disruptive upgrade I have ever seen.

Today my Firefox browser (Version 68.0.2 (64-bit), Win 10) stopped displaying all pages. The loading spinner was rotating indefinitely, and nothing happened. Safe mode did work.

</p><p>Everything worked in safe-mode, but not in the default one.
</p><p>So I backed up all my bookmarks and decided to uninstall ff. But before that I made sure that I'm signed in to FF Sync, and the tabs are synced (there is a checkbox ""Open tabs"" which was checked and is checked now).
</p><p>After reinstalling Firefox I found out that the folder called ""Old Firefox Data"" appeared. I still have it.
I signed in to sync and found zero tabs there. None. All the bookmarks are in place, the history is there, but no tabs.
</p><p>Could you please help me restore the tabs?
</p><p>Copypasting ""Old Firefox Data"" into the ""Local Directory"" (from about:profiles) didn't help.

I found my way into a place on FF where I was able to 'forget' a website which seemed to fix the <a href=""http://vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vegas.com</a> site. However after trying to make a reservation on the site later in the evening the same problem appeared. Pick travel date particulars and the site skips over what should be the next twp steps (booking the hotel &amp; flights) No amount of cookie and or history clearing seems to make the site work again. Seems to me that the security built in to FF is a tad too strict or something and keeps sites from loading correctly, Redbox still will not remember my log-in credentials from step to step while trying to rent movies on line. Anyone else have some suggestions? Disabling all Tracker / Ad  Blockers does not seem to help either.
</p><p>As before, these problems do not occur if I use MS Edge.

Each thing I try to do asks me to reenter my log-in info. Can no longer rent movies. For <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a>, if I try to look at Air/Hotel packages the website always skips the pick a hotel and pick a flight steps and goes right to the option to pick a show to see. Again, this does not happen if I use MS Edge. What could be going wrong with FF new attention to privacy and security that is breaking these sites. I have shut off Content Blocking on both of these sites already.

</p><p>I'm using Quantum 68.0.2 with the Google homepage as my start page.  In recent weeks Firefox has begun to save my search history across multiple sessions (image 1), without any settings having been altered.  This is alarming, as not only have I instructed Firefox not to save search history (image 2) and disabled history in Sync settings (image 3), but as you see I've also set it to clear history when closing, which of late seems to do nothing.  Even after clearing history manually, searches I've made days ago still pop up in my Google suggestions after restarting the browser.  Everything you see in purple is stuff I searched for last Friday, and even had the computer shut off over the weekend.
</p><p>This happens even if I restart Firefox with all add-ons disabled.  I've trawled the forums looking for a solution, but everything I've found is pretty old &amp; involves ""about:config"" parameters that no longer apply as of quite a few versions ago.
</p><p>Notice I have Google search suggestions turned on (image 4), but from my understanding this is separate from saving history, and should merely suggest frequently searched keywords.  Of note is that the history in image 1 does not show up if searching Google from the address bar.

1267427,1566776311,1566776805,SLOW startup: Why does Firefox 68 send/receive more than 550MB of data upon startup?,"<p>I was trying to solve a slow-startup problem with my new upgraded Firefox 68 when I stumbled upon this.
</p><p>If I disconnect my internet, Firefox 68 starts instantaneously.
</p><p>If internet is available, Firefox is taking 45~60 seconds to appear. Worse, while it is background-starting, it is also freezing my UI (Windows Explorer (W7-64)) during the entire time it is conducting these private transactions.
</p><p>After searching for a solution via the forum, reading the support docs for ""slow startup"" (why do they always steer me towards the ""it's not us"" solutions?), I decided to monitor FF with my TCPViewer.
</p><p>After what I found, I decided to create a Firefox account (I didn't want to), just so I could report this here, and hear what people might say about this. Is this happening to anyone else?
</p><p>TCPView showed me eight (8) local ports opened by Firefox (not a problem, part of the architecture, local is blazing fast), followed by 5 to 8 remote TCP ports-- some to a distant 443 (https, and secure), but also a few 80's (http, insecure).
</p><p>One transaction, which was repeated on two consecutive startups, was a pull of more than 550MB from a site belonging to Microsoft (per GeoIP).
</p><p>Please note that my Firefox has uBlock Origin as its only Add-On. I upgraded to 68 because 67 wouldn't stop popping the ""update available"" message, and now I've also added my own policies.json (so I am now free of the pestering). Are these factors?
</p><p>My bottom line question is, why so much remote data exchange before completing startup?

In a non-persistent VDI environment, on occasion we have users that experience the dreaded ""Couldn't load XPCOM"" popup error message. In my research this usually is attributed to a faulty/corrupt update. We are a VMware View shop using instant clones with what's called a ""Writable Volume"" which is, in essence, a file system filter that allows certain user data to be written to persistent storage and the rest is written to the non-persistent VM. Upon logout the persistent disk is detached and the non-persistent VM is removed/rebuilt.
</p><p>We are using the ESR branch of Firefox with policies configured to disable automatic updating, so I'm not sure where Firefox is breaking. Is there anything I can do to assist? On top of this, it's more difficult to reproduce since I'm unable to causing it to error out myself.

Currently, to my limited knowledge, if a particular entry in the browsing-history is deleted, then all instances of that web-page are deleted from historyÂ ; e.g. if I visited a certain web-page of YouTube on 1st Jan, then again on 20th Jan, and then on 30th Mar, but wished to remove the last entry - I would right-click that entry in the ""Library window"" and select ""delete"" and that would result in all of the three visits getting wiped out. I am sure the features of ""most recent visit"" &amp; ""number of visits"" are useful for many but like I explained before, combining all entries in one creates a bigger problem of hampering the flow of recording one's activities (even if it helps reduce RAM usage). 
Currently, this is one of the main problems that I face while using Firefox (for over a year) and always forces me to go back to Chrome (where extensions exist to properly manage history, but are not available for Firefox because of fundamental differences in both programs, while the current Firefox add-ons regarding history are all useless).              
If anyone could properly guide me out of this problem, I would be grateful. Thanks in advance.

It's undoubtedly Firefox built in security devices that are causing this block.

Like right now we have 68.0.1 packaged, and 68.0.2 just came out and Firefox automatically updates to that. Firefox won't work when Altiris installs 68.0.1 because of the detection check looking to see if Firefox 68.0.1 is installed, but it doesn't so it installs 68.0.1. Firefox then says that I'm using an old version and need to make a new profile and I lose my bookmarks, internet history, and logins. We would like to prevent this from happening.

I also worry that if I'm only using one computer and it dies, I'll lose all the custom settings I've created for Multi-Account Containers.
</p><p>We spend so much effort putting specific websites in specific containers, that it is a pity to lose that info, or to have to manually synchronize it to multiple computers.

Having spoken to the credit card issuers, it looks like Firefox blocks the outgoing request for authentication since neither MasterCard nor Visa had any record of a transaction being attempted or authentication being requested. Consequently, the authentication window stays open for ever with nothing happening. I have already alerted my MasterCard issuer, a major retail business, in the hope that their complaint to Mozilla will carry more weight than mine. In the meantime, I wonder if anybody knows of a tweak or change of settings that may resolve this problem until Mozilla role out a fix.

I suspect this problem is related - on the primary window, the work ""File"" is blacked out ... looks like a depressed black section of the menu bar.

Off course, most often from one of the google's pages, such as <a href=""http://gstatic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gstatic.com</a>, <a href=""http://googlesyndication.com"" rel=""nofollow"">googlesyndication.com</a>, <a href=""http://google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google-analytics.com</a>, etc. Warning is usually followed by ""Invalid chrome URI: /"", but not every time.
</p><p>I've already tried these steps to resolve my issue, but without any success.
- restarted FF in safe mode without extensions (no change)
- disabled all blocking features included in FF (no change)
- checked, that javascript itself isn't disabled (it isn't)

1266862,1565984103,1565989207,Need help on reducing bookmarks line spacing,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>First of all, I would like to say that I am a Firefox user since 2007 (since we are in 2019, that's 12 years).
I like it and I thank all the Firefox people that worked on it.
</p><p>However, about two weeks ago I have updated my system from Debian 8 to Debian 10; and with it came a new version of Firefox.
</p><p>And I don't like the way this new Firefox version looks:
- it's ugly 
- it has out of proportion line spacing in the bookmarks
- it has out of proportion line spacing in the Preferences menus
- it is much less visual appealing than previous versions
</p><p>Nevertheless, under the hood, I don't doubt that it is more advanced and better.
</p><p>I just think it's a wrong move from the people leading Firefox at the moment.
Maybe they believe they have to follow the (stupid) trend that many other software houses are following: 
- non intuitive icons
- poor use of colors
- exagerated simplifying in icons design
- minimalistic screen organization
- menus with less options, forcing the users to edit configuration files
</p><p>All this leads to the user having to ""try and guess"", trying to discover how things work.
20 or 10 years ago, the softwares weren't so advanced, but they were more organized and with better menus.
Today, if seems the need is to build something beautiful.
But that beauty soon loses it charm after 5 minutes of interaction.
</p><p>This is the sensation I get from interacting with Firefox nowadays.
And it extends to the support forum, with lack of tast in the design, colors, etc.
Too many steps back, in my opinion.
</p><p>Using Firefox now is not as good an experience like it was some years ago.
We need something that works, that has good menus, that we like to see.
And not being forced to like something that others think it's the present trend.
Firefox is used for the internet, so it needs to be a very good tool.
Stop fooling around with it, please.
</p><p>Also, when I try to solve this problem using themes, I'm stumped because I find some many themes.
But the problem is that they are poor quality themes.
Much quantity, but poor quality.
And the search function, is horrible to say the least.
</p><p>Besides, I don't understand that Firefox now calls themes to simply adding an image to the menu bar.
Is that really a theme?
Is this really a good service?
I don't think so.
I think this is dumb.
And steers users away.
</p><p>I don't care for flowers or manga characters in my menu bar.
I just want well designed folder icons and line spacing that makes sense.
</p><p>Why doesn't Firefox gives the user the choice of using the previous themes?
Aren't we in 2019?
Something like: Menu - Tools - Themes:
- Firefox 55 theme
- Firefox 56 theme
- Firefox 57 theme
[..]
- Firefox xx theme
</p><p>Can you imagine how many hours are you wasting from your millions of users that use Firefox to work and would benefit of something like this?
</p>
<h6 id=""w_"">================================================</h6>
<p>Having said this, now I present my goal with this post:
I would like to know:
- how can I reduce bookmarks line spacing?
</p><p>I use Firefox to work everyday.
I need it to be functional.
I have thousands of bookmarks and I have organized them so they fit my screen.
</p><p>Right now, I am losing much time scrolling up and down within my bookmark folders, because this new version of Firefox has a bigger line spacing than the version I used before.
</p><p>Please see the attached picture.
</p><p>Thank you.

They are different subject versions, not copies  or editions of each other. Depending on which version I am using at the time, Firefox would routinely backup either version, and it can be seen in the Profile. Either version is also visible as a function of time and size, if I want to restore them. When I manually back either version up I do so to a separate folder in ""documents"". There has been no problems for over two years until today. I backed up Version A at 10:00 manually and Firefox also shows one at 10:06. Normal. At 10:15 I restored version B which naturally overwrites version A. Worked fine, as it has in the past. I edited version B using Firefox ""show all bookmarks"". On finishing I selected backup&gt;chose file&gt; version B and nothing happened. So I tried export to HTML with file name - nothing happened. I selected a book mark to open in new tab and it worked. I tried to delete the bookmark, and it would not delete. I can see that my account is synching and has been for about two hours.  This practice of alternating bookmarks version has worked without a hitch for a very long time.

</p><p>This question has to do with the VERY poorly written v68.0.2 update.
</p><p>If you read my prior post, address above, I MUST KEEP V56.0.2 ALIVE IN ORDER TO SAVE REPETITIVE CONSECUTIVE SCREEN PRINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTLY - v68.0.1 HAD NO CAPABILITY OF DOING THAT, AND NEITHER DOES V68.0.2 APPARENTLY.
</p><p>FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF SEVERAL CONTRIBUTORS - I WAS TOLD THAT I JUST NEEDED TO INSTALL v68+ IN A DIRECTORY OTHER THAN ""Mozilla Firefox"" SUCH AS ""Mozilla Firefox - NEW"", IN THE C:\Program Files DIRECTORY.
</p><p>I HAD v56.0.2 RUNNING ON ANOTHER TASK, OPENED V 68.0.1, WHICH DEMANDED AN UPDATE - IT COULD NOT EVEN TELL THAT THE MESSAGE CAME FROM 68.0.1, INSTEAD IT UPDATED THAT TO 68.0.2, BUT IT ALSO TRASHED MY INSTALLATION OF 56.0.2
</p><p>WHILE EXECUTING THIS HORRIBLE UPDATE, IT DID NOT ASK WHICH DIRECTORY TO INSTALL IT IN - IT JUST PLOWED AHEAD AND DESTROYED MY V56.0.2 INSTALLATION, AS WELL AS MY ACCESS TO THE ONLY USABLE SCREEN CAPTURE ADD-ONS - SINCE V57+ DESTROYED THOSE.
</p><p>THE FACT THAT NOW EVEN UPDATES ARE SO POORLY WRITTEN, IT APPEARS THAT THE END OF THE ROAD IS AHEAD FOR MOZILLA.
</p><p>I MUST HAVE A DOWNLOAD LINK TO V56.0.2 WHICH SHOULD RESTORE MY ADD-ONS.

</p><p>IF MOZILLA WILL NOT FIX THE WEB-EXTENSIONS - THIS USER MUST HAVE V56.0.2  BACK NOWÂ ! !Â !
</p><p>RETALIATING AGAINST USERS WHO REQUIRE 2 INSTALLATIONS, JUST TO COMPLETE BASIC BROWSING TASKS (56.0.2 &amp; 68.0.2) SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO PRODUCE USABLE SCREEN CAPTURES WITHOUT HAVING TO REPETITIVELY RE-NAVIGATE TO THE SAME DESIRED DIRECTORY TIME, AFTER TIME, IS TRULY EVIL.

Unfortunately, I am finding that the scroll bar is always ending up at the bottom when I click to move to the next page. The reason this is happening is that when I click to navigate to the next page from the previous page, I have to scroll all the way to the bottom in order to click to get to the Concur Expense Reporting page, so the scroll bar isn't smart enough to go all the way back up when it's on the Concur Expense Reporting page.

My server has a software console port that, for reasons passing understanding, required https protocol so every time I try to access the console I run into security/certificate errors because, presumably, the certificate built into the console software is out of date.
</p><p>A more recent issue is a Tripp Lite KVM console with remote access that has become useless because the SSL protocol that is used by the KVM is no longer supported by any browser.  (Cipher mismatch).
</p><p>The easy answer, of course, is to call up HP and tell them to rewrite the console code - or tell the system owner to toss out his servers and buy new ones .... and of course, learn never EVER to buy a Tripp Lite product.

</p><p>Main problems at the moment:
My address bar in Firefox54 shows lots of options.  They disappeared when I upgraded.
In Firefox54, when I open multiple tabs, they open on their own ""line"".  In Firefox68, all I see is a ""floater"" with one tab. I want all my tabs to show at the ""bottom"". (I use tabmixplus).

Top line: oldstyle menu (File, Edit .....Help)
Next line:  address bar  search bar pocket googleoptions home ......
Next line:  bookmarks
Next line: Prefbar
Bottom line:  open tabs
</p><p>Firefox68:
Top line: old style menu (File, Edit, View, ...)
Next Line: address bar &amp; search bar and that silly 3bars to show the menu.  (everything else has disappeared)
Next Line: bookmarks  (all OK)
</p><p>That's it. Even when I load multiple tabs, all I see is a tab that ""floats"" over the address bar &amp; if I open multiple tabs, they seem to partially ""hide"" behind the menu area so I can vaguely see them behind the bookmarks &amp; address bar - which is very disconcerting

I have a problem logging in to my Firefox Sync account.
I've set up 2-step login before.
When logging in, a 6-digit code from the authentication application is
required. Unfortunately, there is still information that the code you
entered is incorrect.
I have changed the password, but the error with the code still appears.
Unfortunately, after changing the computer, I do not have a recovery key.
Is it possible to delete my account so that I can create it again?
I have already accepted the loss of data, but I care about the address

First my congrats on FF overall of course, to you and your many volunteers.  But I notice a large philosophical programming problem which you might consider.
</p><p>This problem mostly shows with multiple tabs open.  Web servers certainly are slow, and many pages' Html etc poor.  This all results in lots of delays such as reported during:
</p><pre> Waiting for ()
 Read ()
 Transferring data from ()
 Performing a TLS handshake to ()
 Connecting to ()
</pre>
<p>These display the moving ""working"" dot in the left of the affected tab title.  And less often, ""(not responding)"" in FF's title bar, which eventually gets cleared automatically.
</p><p>I have reviewed all 17 screens, and a number of the individual results, from today's FF forum search of:
</p><pre>  169 results for (not responding) for Firefox
</pre>
<p>None address the lack of prioritized co-operative multi-tasking/ threading, DURING such delays as ""Waiting for ()"".  During such a necessary wait, it is very slow at best, e.g. for a user to switch tabs.  Even to one which is ready for display.
</p><p>Responsiveness to user input should be the top multi-tasking priority.  Tab switching.  Rendering/ display of the foreground tab.  Scrolling that down.  Tab closing by user!, and ""X"" to STOP a page from loading -- give those user clicks priority.  Let's not have to wait 10 seconds for a right-click to open its option box.  Let the other busy tabs finish up their work, overlapped in the background priority-wise.
</p><p>This could be done now, but perhaps it would be difficult for volunteer programmers.  Worse case might require a custom replacement, for the effective TCP part of the default vanilla TCP/IP stack.  However I suspect a lot could be fixed short of that, with the correct management encouragement and guidelines.  At least if the continuous motion of the ""busy dot"" indicator in the tab title is a task, just change that to something like just gray-ed out while busy.
</p><p>My experience is with much headroom:  CPU (50%), memory, disk, and network bandwidth, per Task Manager.  NO McAfee.  Mainly just ZoneAlarm taking 30% of that CPU 50% usage.  This is not a problem with start-up delay.  And delays within only one open tab are necessary, of course.  Cheers

How-to can I disable the policy for My Personal FireFox ? ?,"<p>I usually use and update my PortableApps version of FireFox, that runs from my Thumb/Flash drive, at the Public Library network's workstation due to my use of their facilities for research.  
The Library uses this same version of FireFox on each of their workstation, too.  About three weeks ago, PortableApps indicated that FireFox had an Update to version 68 ready for my copy of FireFox to use.  I accepted to update My Personal copy of FireFox to this version while using the Library's workstation running Windows 7.  
Now when I startup my personal copy of FFox from my PortableApps Flash drive, I immediately noticed that INSTEAD of showing the Home page that I had chosen many years ago and was still using, it had changed to the Library's selected Starting Webpage, as if I was starting FFox or Chrome from THEIR installed software ON this workstation (please see -- the attachment showing the Grayed-out selection about the Home Page).  
I have contacted PortableApps via IRC and they confirmed that they do not effect the installation of FFox other than install upon the logically identified drive as the target device.  They felt that there was some background process running and this process might have applied an Enterprise Policy file to this installation process.  They then suggested contacting Mozilla's support. 
I would like to properly address this change and also see what other preferences may have been affected.  I have posted this Question due to having been hurt by using a Generic solution (in the Past) described for a similar but not the same issue (i.e. How to Disable the Enterprise Roots Preference).  
Reading a bit further, there seems to be two methods of accomplishing this type of control (MS's - Group Policy -or- a policy.json file).  
In the meantime, I thought that I would seek Mozilla's Support more specific advise and help.  
I find this VERY annoying considering, I am using my personal version of software and they Only recently ( after using their network for years ) affected my copy without ANY notice posted on their network of this type of change for my consideration.  
My benefit to the use of a my personal copy is to be able to save found sites to My - Bookmarks/Favorites.  Otherwise I would not have this ability, but with notices, I would have found either other public networks or methods to have this functionality years ago. 
</p><p>I hope that someone may have a better process of figuring out how and what to do to in these types of situations.  Also what would be the best way to protect an otherwise operating Browser - Say backing up, WhatÂ ! ? Prior to making changesÂ ?  Thanks ahead of timeÂ !

I tried <em>browser.chrome.toolbar_tips</em> but it doesnât work. 
It occurs with Firefox 68 and 66 one.

Essentially, if I wipe out Firefox entirely ( I went as far as creating a new Firefox Sync account) things work for a while. Problems start to show up in this order:
1. No suggestions from my history when typing in the address bar
2. Old bookmarks show up, ones that have not existed in the new Sync account (I did, however restore my bookmarks from a clone of my SSD made a couple of weeks ago, so they may have been somewhere in there)
3. Cannot delete these old bookmarks
4. Export bookmarks to html creates a file with only folder titles, no links at all (I tried this to see if I could edit out the unwanted bookmarks there and re-import)
5. Export bookmarks to html fails altogether; no file is written
6. Cookie stops being able to read and delete Firefox cookies. The new cookies arrive, can be seen in my Privacy prefs, but don't show in Cookie 5.
</p><p>Most of this sounds like places.sqlite is becoming corrupted. I don't think that is affected by Cookie 5, as I understand it stores only history and bookmarks. I'm waiting to hear from SweetP to confirm Cookie 5 doesn't touch places.sqlite. I suppose I must try to confirm this by starting over again and keeping a copy of places.sqlite when it is fresh, then using it to replace the file in my profile when the problems start. To save time, I plan to try first to replace it with a copy from yesterday from a TimeMachine backup.

Every time I fix it it recurs again a month or two later.  I have read every article online that matches, followed all advice and still the problem comes back.  This time I can't even fix it:
</p><p>It starts with Firefox preventing Macbook Pro from shutting down (OS 10.11.6 - late 2011 model).
It won't force quit
I have cleared the library and the cache.
I have uninstalled and removed the whole Firefox folder from Library/APplication Support.
The macbook then shuts down properly.
I have re-installed firefox.  
BUT without even opening Firefox just putting it in the applications folder, the mac now won't shutdown - the desktop and top menu bar disappear and the wallpaper just hangs.
I have run Malwarebytes to see if I have some malware issue - but it's come up clean.

1266485,1565496374,1565500852,Firefox slow to start and responding to shortcuts,"<p>Hello,
This issue started a month or two ago. Previously, Firefox takes about 1 second to start. The next day, starting my computer, Firefox consistently takes about 5-10 seconds to start. Not only this, but it also takes 5-10 seconds for an already running Firefox to respond to links from external programs (e.g. Adobe Acrobat, Word), as well as opening a second Firefox window by clicking on the Firefox shortcut. Interestingly, everything is fast and smooth with normal browsing and opening a new window via Firefox Ctrl+N is fine. Other browsers and software have no issues (e.g. Chrome). This has been really frustrating as I'm heavily reliant on Firefox and I have tried the following methods to no avail:
</p><p>â¢ Disabling all add-ons / Start Firefox in Safe Mode
â¢ Reinstalling Firefox with fresh / no profiles.
â¢ Disabling anti-virus software (ESET Internet Security)
â¢ Uninstalling anti-virus software
â¢ Flushing DNS and resetting adapter
â¢ [WORKED] Starting Windows in Safe Mode
â¢ Disabling start-up services and processes systematically without Windows Safe Mode [Firefox slow again]
â¢ Disabling all services [still slow]
â¢ [WORKED for a few days...] Clean reinstalling WINDOWS
â¢ [WORKED for a few days...] System Restore (in between restore points I did almost nothing to PC, did not install any new programs, etc.)
</p><p>Sounds like a software issue, but if you want specs:
Intel 7700K, 16GB 3000MHz RAM, Z270, Nvidia 980 Ti, Crucial M500 SSD.
</p><p>What are your thoughts? To me, it seems like something that run in normal Windows mode is slowing Firefox to start. Possibly conflicting apps? But I couldn't figure out which. Obviously, I can't run Windows in Safe mode all the time, so I was wondering if you have a solution?
</p><p>Many thanks
Cam

On both computers, in the ""Devices and Apps"", both do show up as connected, but the work computer still will not sync.  When I click to ""connect another device"", it only tried to install Firefox on my phone - no other option.  I have spent 15 hours doing everything I can find on line to fix, but nothing works.  I even uninstalled Firefox and ALL related items on my work computer and tried to install a couple of older versions, thinking maybe I could get it to sync and then do an update; however when ever I try to install any older version, it only installs 68.0.1.  I am a CEO/software engineer I know my way around computers very well, but still can not solve this problem.  I may be forced to switch browsers.

This started happening about the time that I updated Firefox. I canât say for sure about the exact timeline because I donât go to that website everyday, but thought Iâd mention it in case this was a common problem.
</p><p>I only reboot the PC about once a week, and my wireless Chromebook worked OK accessing weatherbug. 
</p><p>The first thing I did was to clear Firefoxâs cache &amp; cookies. That let weatherbugâs first page load, but I could not navigate, &amp; clicking on its different options just gave a spinning circle. Closing &amp; reopening Firefox gave the 502 Bad Gateway message again. IOW clearing cache &amp; cookies was good for a one time only first page load of weatherbug. All following attempts gave the 502 message.
</p><p>I rebooted the modem &amp; router but that made no difference. I didnât expect it to because the Chromebook worked, but I figured why not give it a try anyway.
</p><p>I then rebooted the PC and that solved the problem.
</p><p>But Iâm curious, what could have been âstuckâ in Firefox that might have caused this problem?
</p><p>Is there something that I could have done to Firefox to fix the problem, instead of rebooting the PC?

1266419,1565391880,1565473979,"Firefox gives a ""Firefox already running"" error despite reinstalling repeatedly","<p>The version I've installed recently is v68.0.1 (x64), my OS is WIndows 7.
</p><p>This error began after my PC suffered a significant error that crashed out most active programs, including Firefox; attempting to start Firefox again caused the relatively common ""Firefox is already running but is not responding. The old process must be closed to open a new window"" error to pop p, with the options ""Close Process"" and ""Cancel"". Clicking either button caused the error message to become unresponsive, and after a few minutes a second identical error would pop up (without the original one ever closing); sometimes when there were several unresponsive errors it would sometimes crash Windows Explorer if I tried to interact with new popups. In Task manager there were multiple Firefox processes running, but attempting to ""End Process"" would not end two of them, they simply stayed there active. By this point I'd resolved all other issues from the PC crash, as far as I could see, and no other programs were showing any issues at all.
</p><p>I restarted the PC several times but the error persisted; I was able to create a new profile in Profile Manager but this did not stop the error. I uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted the parent.lock files in the Appdata/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles folder (they were 'in use by Firefox' if I didn't uninstall and restart the PC first, even though no Firefox processes were listed as running in Task Manager). I then reinstalled Firefox, but I still got the same error popup (though it at least didn't become unresponsive and crash Windows Explorer any more - but I still have the un-ending processes in Task Manager).
</p><p>By this point I've (after backing them up!) uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Roaming folder, everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Local folder, and under Program Files (X86), then reinstalled Firefox again. The error persists, unchanged.
</p><p>Any further suggestions on what I could try would be welcome, I'm stumped by this. Chrome and Avast Browser work fine; Internet Explorer works about as well as it ever does. No new programs had been installed around the time of the problem (to my knowledge) and I've been using Firefox for years on this PC.

When I come back to the facobook page, and it starts to zoom in and out violently, the macbook processor starts to blow hard, because of the increased processor load.

I am not sure if this is a Google of a Firefox problem. In this past week there has been a new information frame appear. Before when one clicked on an image it would be highlighted amid the search grid with some associated information (original site, image size etc). Now this pops out as a separate panel to the right of my browser screem. Due to the quick way I need to work, this is cumbersome and annoying.
</p><p>Also if I right clicked and opened an image in a new tab, it would open with the image filling two-thirds of the screen on the left, which gave a decent view of it. On the right hand panel would be the information about site, title, caption etc. Now all of this is squished into a portrait sized panel that looks as though it has been designed for a tablet or phone. It also means with each image I am having to conduct an additional action to right click to expand to full size so I can actually get a decent view of what it is because it has been so squished down to only medium size by all the other data.
</p><p>My question is this. Up until a few days ago this panel was not there. It would occasionally appear sometimes, especially if I was logged into a Google account but mostly not and would be gone next time I searched. From my investigation of this it is something that appears with some browsers and not others. If this is something that does/doesn't appear in Firefox, how do i make it go away?

I have all the dependecies installed in /home/linuxbrew/.linux and the build setting works previously with firefox 64.0. It seems the build system is looking for dependency in /usr/lib, which contains ancient version of compiler toolchain that can't build firefox. How do I tell the build system to exclude looking into /usr/lib at all?

</p><p>The issue: When a user downloads a .PDF file with Firefox and opens the file via the 'downloads library' it opens the file in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. When the user then attempts to use the 'Attach to Email' function in Acrobat, it returns the error ""the file ""[location of users Outlook .OST file]"" is in use and cannot be accessed. Close any application that is using this file, and then try again. You might need to restart the computer.
</p><p>The issue does not present itself if the .PDF file, downloaded via Firefox is opened from the 'File Explorer' download folder. (EG by clicking the corresponding  'folder' icon next to the download, then opening the .PDF file from there or by any other means of accessing the file in question through File Explorer)
</p><p>There are also no issues downloading .PDF files and attaching them in the same manner, using other browsers or their versions of the download manager. (IE, Edge, Chrome)
</p><p>This issue has appeared on two computers tested so far and is repeatable/persistent.
</p><p>I suspect that the message regarding the .OST file is a bit of a red herring. I think the FF downloads library window is somehow locking the PDF opened through it and thus causing an error when attempting to pass the file over to Outlook to send as an attachment.
</p><p>Any assistance regarding this would be appreciated.

I went back to IE9. Yes 9, as Microsoft couldn't repair Windows 7 to get a later version installed. Anyhow, after my motherboard became erratic and the replacement meant Win 7 no longer worked at all, I decided it was time to 'upgrade' to Win 10. After a complete reinstall of my software from scratch I realised just how bad Edge is and thought I might see how Firefox was holding up. I thought the sync could be useful and was getting on with it until 68.0.1!
Since updating to this version automatically (the settings in options still do not work), it appears it is updating/resetting itself after every reboot. It restores the defaults and behaves as if it has just updated each time. Also after doing this for five times it appears to have broken ADBlock which advises it cannot work any more. I have had to uninstall it to get the tab to stop.
So, as my questions were never answered previously, I'll ask again:
1. How do I get Firefox to stop updating itself? Options 'check for updates but let you choose when to install them' clearly still doesn't work as it updates regardless.
2. How do I get to keep my preferences. Having to go through them all each time Firefox updates is a pain. Surely it cannot be too much to create an ini file?
3. How do I convince Firefox not to keep installing version 68.0.1 over itself?
4. As Adblock no longer works in this version (I'm sure they are pleased with this result), what good alternatives are there?

Why is that?,"<p>Four or five months ago, I saw the Content Blocking shield icon in my Firefox browser.  When I clicked on it, there was no option to disable Content Blocking.  Then I realized that I probably had to create a Mozilla account.  Did that, and suddenly the option was there to disable content blocking.  Today I was at the MSN website - which has been crashing my video driver lately, and I thought that perhaps if I shut off content blocking it would help.  Lo and behold there is no more shield icon but there is an information icon which contains content blocking info (it is an i inside a circle).  Once again there is no 'disable content blocking for this site' option.  What gives?  How can I get the shield icon and the disable option back??  I currently use Firefox version 68.0.1 (64 bit)

How can I solve that problem? I've been using Firefox for years and this never happened. Before, I just opened, let's say, YouTube and I was automatically logged-in to my account.

I cannot update Firefox.  I cannot get any Mozilla approved add-ons to download.   I have tried to connect to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> using all of the Big Three browsers out there and I have the same problem of not being able to connect to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> or any of Mozilla's affiliated websites on any of the browsers.  I am using Windows 10 and currently have the Firefox 68.0.1build.  I have separately ran three different top-tier antivirus programs on my desktop PC and nothing noteworthy was found.  I completely uninstalled the antivirus programs and still no connection to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a>. I tried DNS flush and tried a different DNS server, I tried resetting the modem and router, checked the PC's date and time settings, ensured that no parental controls were enabled, ensured that JavaScript was enabled, removed all Firefox extensions, restarted Firefox in safe mode, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and still have the same problem.  I tried connecting to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> with a free online proxy VPN and was finally successful although Mozilla's GUI didn't completely load correctly.  I am able to quickly and efficiently connect to every other website on the web with any browser including Firefox, but none of the web browsers including Firefox will connect to any Mozilla affiliated or Mozilla extension websites on my PC.  When trying to access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website, the page buffers for several minutes and then the page display's the error code PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR.  Sometimes I get an auto-update message on my Firefox browser that states that a new version is available and so I click to download the new version and all I get is buffering and no downloading.  Then a new message appears after a few minutes stating that Firefox didn't download correctly and that I need to reinstall Firefox.  I uninstall Firefox but cannot access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website to reinstall Firefox because after clicking the link to access the Mozilla webpage there is nothing but buffer and no access.  Using the free online web based VPN I was able to reinstall Firefox, but I still have to same issues.  If I run Windows 10 in safe mode with networking I am able to access all <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> websites and install Firefox extensions.  Is there any known fix to get this issue fixed while running my PC in normal mode apart from completely uninstalling and reinstalling Windows?

I followed Firefox's process only to never get past making the oligarch password setup to work. I even once got the response that the oligarch password was set but when I cameback to it, I got the ubiquitous ""incorrect password"".

I downloaded the 64 bit version, created an account and synched - all went well and I was using the cloned version yesterday. Today after restarting my computer the new version reverted back to the initial install page, asking me to create an account or log in, and all my account info (settings/bookmarks/logins) is gone. How do I synch and then keep all info in new version? I'd like to migrate to the new one permanently and delete old version (which fortunately I haven't done yet). Thanks for any help!

1. Sometimes, all my tabs in Firefox just won't open or load incredibly slow. I can go open them on Chrome and they load up real quick, so it's not a website or connection issue.
2. I use a lot of different Google sites. I'm not totally sure what I did. I think I wanted Google search to be different from work related admin tasks. Anyway, if I open <a href=""http://admin.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">admin.google.com</a>, it totally freaks out. First the tab starts swapping between purple (Google Search) and orange (Work). Then it starts opening tab after tab after tab until I have to force Firefox to shut down. I guess I need to go in and edit settings for some of the containers, but I don't see how to do this?
