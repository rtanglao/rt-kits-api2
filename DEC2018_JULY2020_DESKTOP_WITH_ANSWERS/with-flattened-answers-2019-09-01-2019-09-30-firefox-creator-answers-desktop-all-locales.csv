1269825,2019-09-30 14:55:41 -0800,2019-10-06T20:18:20Z,Firefox 69 broke all cookie exceptions,"<p>Goal: BLOCK ALL cookies using the strictest setting, then use the (archaic) exception interface to allow specific cookies to be set so that specific websites function enough to be utilized as intended. </p><p>Firstly, I am a very experienced Firefox user of many years. I have had my firefox set up as described above since installation, so it's not some operator error problem.  </p><p>I'm uploading three screenshots that will spell out my problem in black and white. </p><p>The specific issue --as shown in the images-- is that immediately after installing firefox 69 all my exceptions no longer function at all. </p><p>As you can see in the image showing site information ""mail.google"" and ""accounts.google"" are being allowed. This is because I used the right-click method on the site to create a cookie exception via site permissions under the ""View Page Info"", so please ignore those two for the purpose of this discussion. If you'll notice in the same image, ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" shows as Blocked with a tiny X next to it. As shown in the image of the (archaic) Cookie Exceptions Interface, the very same site ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" is clearly set to ""Allow"". If I click the tiny X next to ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" in the Site Information's Cookie section (as shown in Image one) the ""exception"" is removed and it just shows ""Blocked"" as it does in the ""<a href=""http://play.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">play.google.com</a>"" <a href=""http://entry.Re"" rel=""nofollow"">entry.Re</a>-adding the exception to the Exceptions lists restores that tiny X but the cookie remains blocked. I have already covered adding redundancies and variants of each domain such as both HTTP and HTTPS etc. I have noticed, however, that entries like ""<a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>"" which used to cover all possible variations by avoiding the prefix altogether have entirely disappeared. It is my theory that this is part of the problem, but on this I am no expert. </p><p>In summary, I would like to restore my FF69 to what it was before FF69: with all cookies blocked and a few select cookies allowed through. Drastic actions like refreshing everything to new and that sort of thing I do not believe is the solution. What I am hoping for here is to alert developers so that they can fix it in an upcoming patch. </p><p>Irrelevant Comments: I had a terrible time trying to utilize this forum. I try to never make accounts and was forced to do so to post here. Fair enough, but in order to do so I had to use Microsoft Edge (BLECH!) because the site simply would not function on Firefox. This is likely to very strict settings on my end but I must say that many other forums work flawlessly. I find this disappointing. </p><p><br> I believe it is time for an entirely new cookie exception interface where entries can be sorted, modified and easily accessed. If you've ever scrolled through 8 zillion exceptions you know what I mean. The Site Preferences interface's cookie &amp; site data entries should be click-able with easy ways to allow or disallow. An advanced mode (with a warning for beginners) allowing more comprehensive exceptions on per cookie basis with features like are available in the browser extension named CookieBro would be absolutely ideal. Firefox seems to be becoming less and less friendly to the advanced user with less and less control over content on a per-site basis. My apologies for including some feedback here, but I can't find anywhere else to send it. </p><p>Thank you one and all for your time in advance, and any solutions that don't involve catastrophic actions will be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1255971;1255997;1256145;1256726;1256740;1257203;1257248;,avalanche238,"id:1257248,created:2019-10-06 20:18:20 -0800,updated:2019-10-06 20:18:20 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>See also: </p> <ul><li>bug 1556212 - Per-Domain Cookie Permissions are broken with FPI enabled </li></ul> <p>(<i>please do not comment in bug reports<br><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html</a></i>) </p> id:1257203,created:2019-10-06 15:03:00 -0800,updated:2019-10-06 15:03:00 -0800,creator:avalanche238,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1256740"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> What URL is that you're testing with?

One feature I very liked in Tab Mix Plus was changed tab open and close order. For example: 1. I open google site (on first tab - parent) and mouse click with Ctrl a few links. Several unread tabs open, one by one (e.g. 2 to 5 - childs).  2. I switch to the third tab. I read content. When I close this tab, Firefox should switch me to first tab again (with google site list in this example) - just to the parent tab again. Instead, without TabMix, Firefox switches to the nearest tab on the right, so I must manually switch to first tab. This is very annoying to me.   </p><p>In other words - FF upon close one tab, should switch to last visited tab - not nearest tab on the right.  </p><p>Is there any solution for this? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-690;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1255973;1256150;,kkk177,"id:1256150,created:2019-10-01 12:54:34 -0800,updated:2019-10-01 12:54:34 -0800,creator:kkk177,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi,  a tried Tab Manager Plus - unfortunately, this addon don`t have option to make switch to last visited tab after close active tab.

A long term problem with AOL web email is they change ads constantly, almost each time you move your mouse.  When one of these ads got hung and didn't load, they often hung Firefox too.  That seems to have has been fixed, thankfully.  Now when an AOL ad fails to load (probably a hung script) and it effects Firefox, Firefox will pop up a bright yellow banner at the top that reads, ""A web page is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do?,"" offering the option to either ""Stop It"" or ""Wait.""  Stopping it almost always solves the problem.  The problem I want to report is, if you step away for a while and then this happens, and you are not there to click either option, and then your computer goes to sleep (I have a Mac), when you wake it, it seems to have eaten all your RAM.  Everything crawls.  I've had to wait many minutes just to get enough RAM to try to force quit apps, hoping to kill whichever one is causing the problem.  Over time, I've learned when this happens, and my Mac slows to a crawl upon waking it, the source of the problem is almost always Firefox, with a hung up AOL ad.  If I can force quit Firefox, I can (albeit slowly) recover normal function.  My suggestion: put a preference setting for a  timer on these yellow banner ""Stop It"" or ""Wait"" alerts.  If, say, a few minutes go by with no action on the user's part, automatically ""Stop it."" </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-690;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1255939;1255960;1255992;,jimcook310,"id:1255992,created:2019-09-30 17:15:57 -0800,updated:2019-09-30 17:15:57 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>See also the Firefox Task Manager </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/task-manager-tabs-or-extensions-are-slowing-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/task-manager-tabs-or-extensions-are-slowing-firefox</a> </li></ul> id:1255960,created:2019-09-30 14:50:56 -0800,updated:2019-09-30 14:50:56 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Quite honestly, why don't you use an advertisement blocker such as uBlock Origin? </p><p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/</a> </p> id:1255939,created:2019-09-30 10:55:20 -0800,updated:2019-09-30 10:55:20 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>”Webpage is slowing down your browser” This is the new way the browser tells you there is a problem with the script program(s). <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/warning-unresponsive-script?cache=no"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/warning-unresponsive-script?cache=no</a> </p><p><br> </p><p>Have you tried Go to the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Add-ons Web Page</a> {web Link} (There’s a lot of good stuff here) and search for a good ad blocker. </p><p><br> </p><p><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/</a> Thunderbird is an e-mail browser also created by Mozilla.

I received questionaires about VPN about 1/2 a year ago, and it now from this link seems firefox want to ship with a vpn in future. Thats not going to end well.  We most probably will have to use firefox's future VPN if we want to use firefox at all in future if I understand correctly. So we have no choice about which vpn to use. This wont work. Its not transparent and void of choice. </p><p>If this is going to be any bit as disasterous as the DOH initiative where we are forced to use cloudfare as our DNS provider, which is dubous to boot, then I think it goes into the direction of firefox painitng itself into a corner. One option for DNS ..cloudfare. one option for transactions firefox's mystery vpn. </p><p>A browser is only safe if I can choose and construct my safety from a selection of competing services. The number of options  ""1"" is always a liability  in these matters.  Its called a pigeon hole, and this trend seemingly moves towards pigeonholing the users. It is ok if we can absolutely trust Firefoxs VPN, but who owns it and most importantly, who controls it?

Firefox out of the box as it currently stands, passes on your public IP address and your INTERNAL IP address by means of webRTC. This is serious.

Although the addresses could be hashed and unusable, the Ip addresses plus available audio device ID's can be used pretty easily not only for tracking, but clearly also possible for hacking.  What is the point you have a very good stealth firewall, when this security bug just passes on your internal and public address straight to any interested website. It is my opinion it is the basis of a lot of browser based intrusions.   I caught this as I am constantly monitoring lan &amp; wan traffic packages to and from my firewall and it picked up my internal address inside a package which lead me after some time to firefox being the culprit.  I would not at all be surprised if your trouble you listed is due to this. This flaw combined with e.g. FF ESR can create a lot of trouble if flash is enabled in ESR etc.  There is a lot of info a cracker can get when you just by accident visiting an infected site, while the webRTC flaw is active in Firefox. Once the internal IP address is known to a cracker, it is easy to attack by that address , no guessing necessary or to access microphones and audio/media devices.  Not even powerful intrusion tools such as NMAP can obtain your interal ip address  and media device IDs. This is very serious in my opinion.  Also remember to stop the microphone device ID leaks etc by doing the following.  To put an end to your microphones and other audio devices details to be visible on the internet (go figure !!)

Is that something which is popping up in its own window, or does Firefox show a Download dialog? I'm not sure what is happening. </p><p>Here are some general thoughts: </p><p>(1) Was your home page/startup page changed to an unwanted page? You can check that setting here: </p><p><a href=""/en-US/kb/how-to-set-the-home-page"" rel=""nofollow"">How to set the home page</a>  </p><p>(2) Could one of your add-ons be pushing this file? </p><p>You can view, disable, and often remove unwanted or unknown extensions on the Add-ons page. Either: </p> <ul><li> Ctrl+Shift+a (Mac: Command+Shift+a) </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Add-ons </li><li> type or paste <strong>about:addons</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return </li></ul> <p>In the left column of the Add-ons page, click Extensions. </p><p>Then cast a critical eye over the list on the right side. Any extensions Firefox installs for built-in features are hidden from this page, so everything listed here is your choice (and your responsibility) to manage. Anything suspicious or that you just do not remember installing or why? If in doubt, disable (or remove). </p><p>Any improvement? </p><p>(3) Could Firefox be resuming a failed download from a previous session? </p><p>You can call up your Download history using Ctrl+J and if there is a failed download you want to remove from history, you could try right-click &gt; Remove From History. </p> id:1255719,created:2019-09-29 09:35:28 -0800,updated:2019-09-29 09:35:28 -0800,creator:benyandell,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>BenYandell <a href=""#question-1269755"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I just installed Firefox.

So let's consider possible blockers: </p><p>Firefox's Content Blocking feature and extensions that counter ads and tracking may break websites that embed third party content (meaning, coming from a secondary server). </p><p>(A) Do you see a shield icon toward the left end of the address bar, near the lock icon? More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>. </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p> <hr> <p>If a site is generally known to work in Firefox, these are some other standard suggestions to try when it stops working normally: </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

This would be along the lines of video sites that pause when you switch tabs. Another possibility is that Firefox receives a signal from Windows to stop playing; I'm not familiar with how that works. Another possibility is that Firefox keeps playing, but since it didn't instruct Windows to keep the speaker active when power saving kicks in, Windows ignores the audio. Perhaps you can distinguish among these by checking the player when you wake up the system. Has it continued to progress beyond the point where the sound stopped, or did the player stop at that moment? </p><p>For testing, maybe use a locally saved MP3 so you can use the full controls. </p> id:1256960,created:2019-10-05 08:48:31 -0800,updated:2019-10-05 08:48:31 -0800,creator:frederik_franke,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Is there really no solution for this problem? </p>"

No blue header, no search box, no profile name, no home, no notifications, nothing, a totally blank page. Just <a href=""https://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com</a> in the address bar with the green padlock. If I click on another person’s FB link, I get ""Sorry, something went wrong"" ""we are working on getting this fixed as soon as we can. Go Back or help.”   Clue #1 The Firefox browser my FB was bookmarked on, started messaging that it was NOT my default browser. (it WAS; before the problem) When I tried to make it my default, Firefox was NOT on the list. Thought I may have a virus. From IE I downloaded and ran Microsoft Safety Scanner - zero infections. Clue #2 Other browsers (IE, Edge) on this computer, that had my FB bookmarked cannot excess any FB pages.  All other non-Facebook bookmarks work as normal.  One Chrome browser that only had my wife’s FB page bookmarked on it, was not affected (all her bookmarked FB pages are still accessible as before.) I can even see my FB page with it and can message to it. Another home computer (Windows 8.1) has the exact same problem – all browsers with my FB page bookmarked are blocked from getting to any other FB page. The Chrome browser with only my wife’s FB page bookmarked is not affected.   Clue #3 After two days I uninstalled my Firefox browser and downloaded a new Firefox browser. Firefox wanted me to sign up for an account.  I used the same email address for this new account as I had for my Facebook sign in account. I was unable to create the Firefox account, got ""500 Error Oh dear, something went wrong there. We've been notified and will get working on a fix."" And tried to verify this account via the same email and I got “Verification error (loading Chunk 23 failed)” Later I was able to create the new account and verify it by using an email other than the one for signing into Facebook. (My wife’s FB sign in email account is NOT the same email provider as mine.)  Clue #4 Found my Facebook page. I searched for it using my name and “Facebook,” it was at: <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/(my"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.facebook.com/(my</a> name)?refid=7.  Bookmarked it on my new Firefox browser. Researching M.Facebook , I get: “<a href=""http://m.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">m.facebook.com</a> is styleless version of the site with limited capabilities. It is intended for those with older phones and less powerful mobile browsers. It allows just viewing your feed and commenting on posts.” It only uses the center part of my computer screen. I didn’t have to sign into it. I can message my wife and she can message back. I can see my friends list and comment on their posts.  See screenshot of m.facebook. Note: a couple hours before this all started, my Firefox browser was hijacked with a message from Microsoft (see screenshot) I assumed it was malware and deleted it the way I normally do. Right clicked on my task bar&gt;task manager&gt;Firefox&gt;end task.   Sorry this is so long winded.

Před pár dny mi odpoledne ještě vše fungovalo a večer se stránka načetla nekorektně. Od té doby nemohu používat Firefox, ale ostatní prohlížeče fungují. Na druhém počítači se stejnými Win7/64b mi stejná verze Firefoxu normálně funguje, takže problém musí být v konkrétním prohlížeči. Stránka se načte v podivném textovém režimu s obrázky. Jsou na ní stejné informace jako mají být, jen jinak umístěné a cca 1/4 roku staré. Po kliknutí na odkaz proběhne jen refresh této stránky, ale nespustí se hra. V anonymním okně hra funguje jak má. Vymazal jsem historii, s tím že jsem zatrhnul vše a vybral i čas vše, vymazal jsem cookies a nic nepomohlo. Přes nápovědu jsem vyzkoušel spustit firefox v nouzovém režimu bez doplňků, ale ani to nefungovalo. Řešil jsem problém s podporou hry, ale netuší co může být špatně s konrétním prohlížečem.

I sent a copy of the entire Failure Message to them, after earlier explaining the entire situation in detail. Supposedly their engineers worked on this starting about three weeks ago. Really? I have gotten no feedback, no questions about my system from them, nothing of value from Yahoo so far. The suggestion ""Please use the new mail version for adding another disposable email address by switching mail versions."" doesn't help much because it ignores the situation; I have the New Mail version open in a supported (Firefox) browser, and it ignores the conflict shown in the second document of my last reply here.   . I have attached here a document with three sections, the first with the top of the Failure notice; the second being the last response from Yahoo C.S.; and the third showing the link to the Troubleshooting page  and the suggestions which are listed there.  I think the bottom data of the Failure Notice is of no value. I could also post it if you want. Edit: Sorry, forgot to add the attachment...and am having trouble finding it. Seems to be that I used an unsupported file type. Am working on a fix.  OK, have copied the text to Paint. May not look as good, but has the same information, although less readable.

I used to use IE11 for my mail and although it is now ""unsupported"",  can still use it to get the Basic Mail version, which gives me the same results as the New Mail version here in Firefox which is supported. Since Yahoo was taken over by Oath, and various other changes occurred in Yahoo Mail, I think the problem is in the mail program, not the rest of the system.  I've attached two edited screenshots of the mail settings page, one showing the settings page and the second after the ""Add"" (a disposable address) button is clicked.

If I send to any of the disposables using either the main or secondaries, I first get a notice the message was successfully sent but shortly later get a ""mailer-daemon"" Failure Notice (with error code 554) and the message never is received. I can send to a second (proton mail) address using either the Yahoo main or secondary address, but sending from Protonmail to  the secondary addresses also fails.  For years, I have used a few of the secondary addresses for agencies and groups I belong to. I haven't received any messages from any of the secondaries in a few months. I assume others get my messages from the secondary accounts, but I never get their replies.  I first realized I had the problem when I was going to set up a new address and found the original base name was missing; the page was asking me to establish one (that couldn't be ever changed), even though my list of current secondary addresses based on the old base name was still showing on the left of the page. I did nothing, including reentering the old base name, as I was unsure what the results would be. </p><p>I did also notice that Yahoo has a feature I'd previously been unaware of that lets one set up (different?) addresses which can only be sent from, not be received at.

What have you tried to fix the broken Pandora login page so far? </p><p>If a site is generally known to work in Firefox, these are standard suggestions to try when it stops working normally: </p><p><strong>Double-check content blockers:</strong> Firefox's Content Blocking feature and extensions that counter ads and tracking may break websites that embed third party content (meaning, from a secondary server). </p><p>(A) Do you see a shield icon toward the left end of the address bar, near the lock icon? More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>. </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom.

More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>. </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><em>Some other standard suggestions for problems with an individual website:</em> </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the option/alt key when starting Firefox. (On Windows, hold down the Shift key instead of the option/alt key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?"" Help &gt; Restart with Add-ons Disabled </li><li> (menu bar) Help menu &gt; Restart with Add-ons Disabled </li></ul> <p>and OK the restart. </p><p><em>Both scenarios:</em> A small dialog should appear.

The problem was switching another account. The same problem obviously through a computer browser (design mode). I understand that the error is Google, but still I believe that the browser must work even with such errors. I also encountered the problem of translating pages. Let's say from English to Russian. I have a google plugin. I think that it would be better if Mozilla had its own plugin and it was better than Google's. I see the pluses in you and I hope that the performance of your browsers will be better than Google and Apple, but when I see such errors, they unfortunately do not give such advantages. And I believe that it is necessary to work on the design of the browser for a greater desire to use and open it. I will be glad if listen to me.

This is frustrating. </p> id:1254500,created:2019-09-23 17:13:18 -0800,updated:2019-09-23 17:13:18 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>On Mac you need to check ""Preferences -&gt; Sync"" to have a button to go to the Firefox Account settings page (Manage Account), but you can go directly to the link I posted above. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/settings</a> </li></ul> <p>I assume that the Lockwise app for iOS has a three bar menu button in the top right corner just like the app for Android has where you can connect to a specific Firefox Account via the email and password for this account. </p> id:1254490,created:2019-09-23 16:38:17 -0800,updated:2019-09-23 16:38:17 -0800,creator:blindley,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi webmaster 1121 </p><p>When you click the menu icon in your browser, try clicking <strong>Logins and Passwords</strong> and that should pop up your Firefox Lockwise if i'm not mistaken. </p><p>Is that option available? </p> id:1254486,created:2019-09-23 16:29:04 -0800,updated:2019-09-23 16:29:04 -0800,creator:webmaster1121,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks for you suggestion.

This time you disabled all of them and make running my business impossible. I tried the fix you suggested by running the ""studies"". Nothing happened. You indicated the problem was with version 66. I have it happening with version 69.01.  I would like to know which version of Firefox was the last version that doesn't constantly ask me to update Firefox, and send me to that download site.  I plan to stay with that version forever because: 1) you guys can't seem to leave my ad ons alone, and you won't give me the option to update Firefox when I want to without constantly being reminded to update, and you won't provide the option to turn the reminder off. I'm swearing at the top of my lungs right now for the fourth time. You guys work hard at improving everyone else's experience in areas I care nothing about, But for us who spend hours reviewing ad ons to make our lives easier and for ad on you approved, you screw with us instead for some unknown reason. I really wish some of you experts would start up another Browser and allow us to impart chosen ad ons as a default part of the browser that programmers can't mess with.

My ISP, Verizon FIOS does not provide IPv6 but a Firefox extension does. I am happily surprised. </p><p>The problem is that for no apparent reason connections to any website will stop working.

The tab remains empty during this waiting time, while no sign of the loading process can be seen: The tab header shows no title, only the URL. The animated loading icon of the tab header is not shown. The  status bar shows no activity. For about 5 to 20 seconds it looks like the tab is frozen. (See hardcopy.) This phenomenon occurs irregularly, but repeatedly, approximately with 10-20 percent of all calls, regardless of the requested URLs. It typically occurs piled within a random period, that lasts between a some seconds and several minutes. It also happens in safe mode, regardless of the used profile (even an unmodified new profile) and both in private an non-private windows. As far as I can judge, the troubleshooting Information shows no abnormalities. There are no issues with the internet connection.

You can use multiple profiles (e.g. home/work) and connect them to separate Firefox Accounts each with their own email address. You would have to disconnect Lockwise from the account and reconnect to another account. I haven't checked whether this is possible and how many steps this takes. Maybe use a third profile with its own Sync account that has all the passwords and connect that profile to Lockwise. You can add new passwords to Lockwise on desktop. This is of course more work to keep the passwords up to date if you add a new password on either of the two other profiles, but is the only way to keep profiles separate. </p> id:1254072,created:2019-09-21 23:53:22 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 23:53:22 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi, </p><p>The people who answer questions here, for the most part, are other Firefox users volunteering their time (like me), not Mozilla employees or Firefox developers. </p><p>If you want to leave feedback for Firefox developers, you can go to the Firefox <em>Help</em> menu and select <em>Submit Feedback...</em> or use <a href=""https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a>.

UI no more than a slider, or open field to set days/hours.. Or even a line in about:config...

I don't know if the issue exists even with all plugins disabled, as sometimes it takes hours for this behavior to happen, and I need to have plugins enabled to do work.  </p><p>A couple times a day, all tabs within the browser show a spinner.  The only (useful) way to fix it is to restart the browser.  If I close the browser and wait, the window disappears, but I can still see (in the windows process manager) that there are two threads running.  If I wait long enough (3-5 min), firefox will crash and send a report to mozilla.  To get back up faster, I can kill the threads and restart firefox. </p><p>But I can also pull tabs into a new window and they will display correctly.  And then when I pull the tab back to the original window, it keeps displaying correctly for a while.

That might help people more quickly realize that an addon is causing the slow down (assuming that is the case). </p><p>I don't know what the best solution, but there has got to be a better way than refreshing, losing all data, and then being expected to selectively copy information into a profile! </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-690;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1253631;1253634;1253654;1254257;,john76,"id:1254257,created:2019-09-22 22:02:51 -0800,updated:2019-09-22 22:25:27 -0800,creator:john76,updated_by:john76,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks everyone for the feedback.

In the address bar, type about:config and press Return. o	The about:config ""This might void your warranty!"" warning page may appear. Click I accept the risk! to continue to the about:config page. 2.	In the Search field, type print_printer. 3.	Hold down the control key while you click on the print_printer setting and select Reset. 4.	Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click Quit Firefox. When you start Firefox again, try printing the page with which you had problems previously. Note:In old versions of Firefox print.print_printer was the preference name. The old preference name may exist along with the new name. That old preference can be removed via a control-click and Reset, then restart Firefox, and print something. That preference won't reappear, only the newer should be there. Reset all Firefox printer settings If the above steps did not work, you may want to reset all of Firefox's printer settings: 1.	Open your profile folder: From the Help menu, choose Troubleshooting Information. The Troubleshooting Information tab will open. o	Under the Application Basics section, click on Show in Finder. A window will open that contains your profile folder. Note: If you are unable to open or use Firefox, follow the instructions in Finding your profile without opening Firefox. 2.	Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click Quit Firefox. 3.	In your profile folder, copy the prefs.js file to another folder to make a backup of it. 4.	Open the original prefs.js file in a text editor (such as TextEdit). 5.	Remove all lines in prefs.js that start with print_ and save the file. If something goes wrong when you open Firefox, close it again and overwrite prefs.js with the backup you made. </p>"

When server and client both belong to the same HomeGroup, a protocol similar to Kerberos, Public Key Cryptography based User to User Authentication will be used instead of NTLM. HomeGroup is probably the easiest way to share resources on a small network, requiring minimal setup, even compared to configuring a few additional users to be able to use Password protected sharing, which may mean it is used much more than Password protected sharing on small networks and home networks. If the server is a device that supports SMB, such as NAS devices and network printers, the NTLM SSP may offer the only supported authentication method. Some implementations of SMB or older distributions of e.g. Samba may cause Windows to negotiate NTLMv1 or even LM for outbound authentication with the SMB server, allowing the device to work although it may be loaded with outdated, insecure software regardless of whether it were a new device. If the server is a member of a domain but Kerberos cannot be used. The client is authenticating to a server using an IP address (and no reverse name resolution is available) The client is authenticating to a server that belongs to a different Active Directory forest that has a legacy NTLM trust instead of a transitive inter-forest trust Where a firewall would otherwise restrict the ports required by Kerberos (typically TCP 88) </p>"

Btw. it would be a good idea, if profile settings (cookies, addon settings, look and feel could be synced for Firefox on different computers. </blockquote> <p>Firefox ESR release itself works quite well now after reinstalling all the extensions and reconfiguring them since they have been killed by the latest version. </p><p>The only problem still remaining and for which I still need the  69 Version, which I could luckily restore using a system backup - is that I still need to attend an quite important blog for me. I don't have any login or password settings, and it is impossible for me to get them,  I can only attend the block because of the cookie settings stored in this particular browser.  </p><p>It was extremly annoying and awful, to have suddenly no access to this importnant blog any more due to this f*cking overnight update! </p><p>Could you tell me please in particular, how I can reimport this cookies from the 69 versioninto the ESR release? I think this would help a lot.  </p><p>It is also extermely annoying, that with every update I have to redo all menu bar settings for my extensions on every firefox browser on different computers - not only once but for all browsers individually. It would be extremly helpful, if all this stuff could be integrated in the sync mechanism insted of making a lot of new fancy features which no one really requires.  </p><p>In my personal view, the old versions of Firefox were much more stable and quite better than nowadays. You could configure Firefox quite simply. For example, I still would like the bookmark list on top and the tab list below the adress field. If there is a large list of open tabs, it was so much better to have up to three rows of open tabs. Now the tabs are walking beside and out of my focus. I always have to check manually, if there are still more open tabs, hiding behind the edge of the browser window. I cant understand at all, why this great features have been removed. It seems that Mozilla wants to punish people for using firefox.  </p><p>I use the browser simply to do my daily work, I would really like a simple and stable version, individually configured for my personal needs, not changing too much over time. But instead, every single update creates a real mess. Nothing works anymore as expected, everywhere is an unexpected bomb shell. Nowadays it is not possible to surf the internet without google chrome. Try using eg using google maps on Firefox. It only works on a very lucky day. Many gov. administration sites have quite outdated stuff on their home pages. It is not possible to use them securely within firefox. It was not possible for me, to make an online declaration of my taxes, for whatever security reasons. In particular when you always declare your taxes in the very last minute, this is completely awful.  </p><p>There are e.g. webpages on the net, where the rendering of firefox is a complete failure. There is no problem applying chrome.  When I want to see a web page from my local intranet, I always get a warning, that my page may not be secure. What a bullshit. I am knowing quite well, that my web page is indeed fully secure. What the hell wants me the Firefox browser to tell? I don't think this problem can be solved by employing artificial intelligence, human intelligence would do a much better job here. </p><p>Kind regards </p> id:1253742,created:2019-09-20 15:10:51 -0800,updated:2019-09-20 15:10:51 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There is an ""-allow-downgrade"" parameter as a command line switch available that should be used with care, so make sure to backup your profile folder. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Command_Line_Options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Command_Line_Options</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles</a> </li></ul> id:1253677,created:2019-09-20 11:25:52 -0800,updated:2019-09-20 11:25:52 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Note: Once an old version of the browser detects that there is an update, it will do so.

Traditionally, it looks like the following, although there is a more modern numbering scheme as well: </p><p>173.248.187.15 </p><p>Once this address has been retrieved, the DNS query phase is done and Firefox can send the web request. </p><p>Normally your DNS resolver is your computer's operating system, which usually sends DNS requests to your network service provider. Sending DNS requests over HTTPS prevents intermediaries from reading those requests. This is helpful for keeping your DNS queries private, just as HTTPS web requests help keep your browsing private. </p><p>However, DNS over HTTPS doesn't play any role in how servers respond to web requests, whether you get back legit results or hacked results. DNS over HTTPS also doesn't bypass malicious add-ons you might have installed in your Firefox. And similarly if you have a ""man in the middle"" of your connection, DNS over HTTPS doesn't protect you from what the MiTM might do to your web requests. </p> id:1253871,created:2019-09-21 04:52:00 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 04:52:00 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello  jraju, </p><p>In addition to all of the above  -   would you please read this article : </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-caused-malware"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-caused-malware</a> </p><p>Run  <strong>all</strong>   malware scans that are listed there;   what one doesn't pick up,  the other one might. </p> id:1253870,created:2019-09-21 04:47:12 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 04:47:12 -0800,creator:user633449,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Have you run the Malwarebytes scan? </p> id:1253845,created:2019-09-21 02:21:44 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 02:21:44 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I looked up ""folmetor. com"" and all that I could find are scam removal tools for it so, it is obviously a scam site probably full of redirects. </p><p>Refer to your <strong>other</strong> thread for info regarding extensions to help prevent redirects. </p> id:1253842,created:2019-09-21 02:10:00 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 02:10:00 -0800,creator:jraju,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi, i have already enabled those but still redirects takes place </p><p>This is a new attack on browse pages by <a href=""http://folmetor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">folmetor.com</a>. i do not understand, why when my ip addresses are set over dns over https server, also produce this kind of redirects. am i missing in something. when you go to the site, there is nothing suspicious, but cliking on links on that auto redirects thro <a href=""http://folmetor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">folmetor.com</a> did you hear about folmetor annoyance </p> id:1253722,created:2019-09-20 13:42:21 -0800,updated:2019-09-20 13:42:21 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There are Firefox Add-ons which help block redirects: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?platform=windows&amp;q=redirect&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=extension"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?platform=windows&amp;q=redirect&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=extension</a> </p><p>And Malwarebytes Browser Guard can block malicious content when you are redirected: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/malwarebytes/?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/malwarebytes/?src=search</a> </p> id:1253609,created:2019-09-20 08:25:45 -0800,updated:2019-09-20 08:25:45 -0800,creator:user633449,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It sounds like you probably have a virus on your computer.

You can click that row to show more details on the right. </p><p>Possibly the format is indicated by the requested page name. Otherwise, it would be a parameter. </p><p>If it's a GET request, then the format should somehow be indicated in the URL of the request. If it's a POST request, the format may be in the form body. Either way, view the <strong>Params</strong> section on the right side and see whether that shows the wrong type (like CSV or QBO). </p><p>And if it is different each time, is there any pattern to it? </p>"

(It chooses a consistent one from some older bookmarks I have... let's call it ""random"" as there's nothing special about that older bookmark, but it's mostly consistent (more below on that.).   </p><p>If I drag from the URL line to the DESKTOP (or from a Bookmarks toolbar folder of links) it will have a different icon. The icon is again generally consistent but again random in that it has no relation to the item being linked.  I can't seem to figure out what condition causes one or the other.  Note that every once in a while it will also give me this alternate icon for a URL dragged to the menu/toolbar. Once it's done that, that will forever be the icon for that link - even if I delete the link and start over. Sometimes it gives me the Firefox default icon (when it should give me a favorite from the site) but that's in a few cases. Once again, I can't seem to figure out what condition causes one or the other (or the other).  </p><p>If I look at the Library pull down tool/menu of ""Recent Highlights"" it will be correct. However, if I look at the Library -&gt; Bookmarks under Recently Bookmarked it will generally be wrong. Sometimes it will be correct in both but continue to give me the wrong icon (Firefox default) when I drag it from the URL line or Bookmarks menu to the desktop.  </p><p>If the very FIRST thing I do is to Bookmark this Page upon arriving, it all works normally. But if I drag the URL first before doing that, I get the errant behaviors above.  Some can eventually correct by deleting and using the Bookmark this Page feature but generally they retain some errant behavior.  There is no consistent workaround that works (at all) or consistently.  </p><p>Note that the correct favorite icon appears in the TAB header, so it's not an issue with fetching the correct icon or there being one supplied by the web developer.  </p><p>This has been going on for a while... a month or more. It's probably related to an update but I can't tell you which specifically as I usually do them as a matter of course when they come out. I don't know if it was there in 67.* but it's been there in 68 and it's in 69. I've been through many reboots, full shutdowns, even an unrelated hardware swap of the disk drive to a different (but identical) machine, etc. It's not a transitional problem. </p><pre>Also note that the other browsers on my computer seem to be working normally including MSIE and Chrome. </pre>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-690;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1253485;1254266;,MozzieBob,"id:1254266,created:2019-09-22 22:44:06 -0800,updated:2019-09-22 22:44:06 -0800,creator:MozzieBob,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks...

Google's scripts are very difficult to read, so it might not be possible for outsiders to debug exactly why <em>most</em> characters are placed after the insertion point but <em>some</em> are placed before it. Or to put that differently, why the insertion point is correctly positioned after a new character <em>most</em> of the time, but sometimes isn't. </p><p>One thing I might suggest is to inject a keystroke listener script to report whether Firefox and other browsers might use different key codes/values for the affected keys on your keyboard (for example, by logging certain event parameters to the console).

Awesome landscapes those of the Tyrol, totally recommended. </p><p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure Google has something to do about it. I specifically tested v39 and the ESR because I recall using this versions in a previous job and never found this issue. Now it happens also with those. </p><p>As for the profile suggestion (thanks, i didn't think about that), I have just tried with a new profile (win+ latest FF) in a new google account and it isn't working. </p><p>All info you gathered is correct except that ""Any action (clicking or typing in sheet) after this, erases the entire cell"". It does not erase the whole cell content but the cell reference introduced previously (using the mouse or arrows) that was...so to say 'selected'. For instance, if I try to write this formula =MAX(23; C14+C15) I end up with this one =MAX(23; C15)+. That's because I write the first part, then click on C14 to add it to the formula, then '+' (the cursor stays between C14 and '+' while C14 is selected), then click on C15 (that overwrites the C14 reference writing C15 in its place) then close the bracket (that goes before the '+' because the cursor is still there). I can make another gif with this latter example. So, please, tell me if I didn't explain that clearly enough. </p><p>Two other things I would like to point out: first I used portable FF of all previous versions (didn't want to uninstall the latest one). And second, I'm using physical Spanish keyboards (both the laptop's and an external Logitech). In my tests I changed the layout in the OS. Maybe changing a EN keyboard to ES layout can replicate the issue. </p><p>Thanks </p> id:1253762,created:2019-09-20 17:32:16 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 01:18:43 -0800,creator:Noah_SUMO,updated_by:Noah_SUMO,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hey Coriscow! </p><p>Thanks for all your diligent testing to try to find out when this bug first broke &amp; by checking a lot of our past versions! I was going to suggest that so I'm happy you already did it on your own. :D </p><p>That leads me to believe it's a weird issue originating from Google Sheets but in a way that Firefox doesn't like or can't understand. We used to have a lot of weird issues with Google Docs for example. To the point we believed Google was actively sabotaging the GDocs experience for Firefox users, just so people would switch to Google's Chrome to use GDocs instead. </p><p>In this case, I can't say that's what's happening for sure. Especially since it works ok in EN-US. But I just wanted to bring up the past weirdness of Google's web products on browsers other than their own. Hopefully this won't be too hard to fix or compensate for on our end. </p><p>I was going to file a bug for you but wanted to see if you could describe your issue a bit better. I got all of the detail &amp; the animated GIF of the problem which is awesome &amp; highly appreciated! I'll attempt to explain if I understand your issue correctly &amp; you can correct me if I've missed something in my attempt to summarize your issue better. ;) </p><p><strong>The weird GSheets Cell overwriting issue:</strong> • Write a formula in a cell (A1+A2 or A1*A2) • Make sure the '+'  is from the regular keyboard NOT numberpad/numerical keypad • Blinking cursor then stays in front of the '+' instead of behind it • Any action (clicking or typing in sheet) after this, erases the entire cell </p><p><strong>Specific requirements to trigger bug:</strong> • Depends on the keyboard layout. I use a Spanish (ES) keyboard layout.  Works fine with US, UK, US_Intl, FR, PL programmers keyboard layouts. Doesn't work with ES, DE, IT, FI and Serbian. Moreover, few of them (FR and FI) works for one sign (+ or *) but not for the other. • Only happens when the previous cell was introduced using the mouse or the arrow keys, not if it was written. • Only happens when using the '+' or '*' from the regular keyboard, NOT the ones from the numerical keypad. </p><p><strong>Notes of importance:</strong> • Tested issue in all non-Firefox browsers on both Win &amp; Mac. All worked. Detailed test list: Tested on Chrome, Opera, Edge (edgeHTML), Safari and FF for Mac. Only happens in FF both Mac and Win. • Tested against older FF versions such as 68.0.2, 59.0.3, 39, 60.9 ESR. All had the same issue/bug. • All Add-ons were disabled. </p><p>Do I have all that right? :P  </p><p>Did you also create a new, fresh Firefox profile for these tests? Don't do them all over again if you haven't. But you could just create one new profile &amp; do a few of the tests again. You can then check *about:profiles or about:support (Profile Folder line) to see which profile is in use. If you get the same results, the rest of your findings should still hold true. </p> <ul><li>*You will see a message that says: ""This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."" </li></ul> <p>But I won't lie that the specific requirements to trigger this bug will make it tricky to fix. But I think the saving grace is this problem stems from using certain locale keyboard layouts. This gives me hope the problem can be isolated to something in that code &amp; fix it for all affected locales. :) </p> id:1253289,created:2019-09-19 07:54:29 -0800,updated:2019-09-19 07:57:20 -0800,creator:alberto.corisco,updated_by:alberto.corisco,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi! </p><p>Fred I'm using v69.0.1, updated this very morning (but it still happens).

I logged back into Firefox on the computer that I imported the backup to, and again, everything was screwed up.  </p><p>So, signed out again, chose the option to delete everything and restored the backup again. That is where I am right now. I am thinking something is corrupt with my account, but I do not know how to fix it. I was hoping that someone could help me. I have looked through the support documents, but I have yet to find one that helps me. I am running Windows 10 on four computers, Linux Mint on one and three Raspberry Pies with Raspbian.

Basically what is happening is that whenever I'm using Firefox, it will very frequently stutter/lag. And by ""frequently"" I mean once every 2-4 seconds. This stutter hangs for about another 1-2 seconds before any inputs I attempted will suddenly and quickly catch up. </p><p>For instance, if I'm typing (like I'm doing with this description) it will regularly hang as I type for about a second or two. I can still type while it is hanging, but nothing will appear on the screen until it finishes its stutter, then it will suddenly just display everything that I typed.   </p><p><br> -Important note: When I say ""hangs"" I don't mean in the tradition sense where the browser goes unresponsive. The browser does not freeze. In the case of me typing in a text box, the cursor still blinks as if it is waiting for input. If I'm watching a video, the video will continue to play, etc. What is ""hanging"" is literally my ability to input anything. </p><p>Another example: Scrolling. I'll attempt to scroll, then it will hang for a moment, then quickly jump to the location it 'should' have scrolled to.  </p><p>This goes for literally any input. And Like I said before, it seems to be getting worse and worse gradually over time. It started as a negligible little hiccup that happened randomly. Then it got more frequent and more pronounced. Now I can't even type a full word without it lagging out. Just earlier I was watching a youtube video and tried to click my mouse to pause the video... but the video didn't pause for a full 3 seconds until after I clicked my mouse. </p><p>Things I have done so far: </p> <ul><li>I made sure I was using the most recent version of Firefox (69.0) </li><li>I downloaded chrome to test if that gave me the same issues. It did not. Everything worked super smoothly.  </li><li>I looked at the resources Firefox was using in task manager and Firefox uses about 530mb of memory, and hovers between 4-11% of CPU usage. </li><li>I have already attempted a restore for Firefox, which did nothing to fix the issue. </li><li>I've made sure my graphics drivers where up to date. </li><li>I've disabled hardware acceleration in the settings. </li></ul> <p>I've been using Firefox for over 12 years now and I really don't want to switch browsers... but I don't know what else I can do. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;windows-10;bug_1;firefox-690;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1252892;1252896;1252923;1252933;1252934;1252935;1252945;,R315r4z0r,"id:1252945,created:2019-09-18 00:30:44 -0800,updated:2019-09-18 00:30:44 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I called for more help. </p> id:1252935,created:2019-09-17 20:33:36 -0800,updated:2019-09-17 22:26:16 -0800,creator:R315r4z0r,updated_by:R315r4z0r,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It has nothing to do with the internet connection.

I still have the 69.0 version installed in a separate directory. Obviously something in that 69.0 update did not sit right with my computer. I'll wait until the next update to see if anything has changed.  </p><p>I appreciate everyone's help anyway. </p><p>EDIT: Okay, so the work around is no longer beneficial because Firefox keeps automatically downloading and installing 69.0 upon starting up. There is no way for me to disable this. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled 68.0.2 like 10 times now trying to quickly boot the browser, rush to the options and quickly disable auto-updates... but it's not possible to do so. </p><p>Fortunately, I learned of Firefox ESR. I downloaded that in 68.1 and it seems to be okay now.

1269017,2019-09-17 12:47:02 -0800,2019-09-22T04:58:04Z,Why does Firefox invent new saved addresses for autofill and how could I control it,"<p>For quite a while every time Firefox thinks it sees any sort of variation in an autofill address, it has asked if it should change the saved address or save a new address (I have complained that it lacks a Do Nothing choice).  In the past I have usually just ignored this prompt when I didn't want it to do either and usually it has been ok. </p><p>Every once in a while however, Firefox just decides to create a new saved address without my telling it to and without telling me about it.  Then on some future website when I go to fill out a form, I will suddenly find that I have what look like duplicate choices because Firefox only shows the list for the current field plus a little more data which may or may not show what is different. </p><p>The most recent instance, Firefox created a duplicate of my name, address, email, phone, etc. The only difference was that the new address included data in the Organization field.  It took me while to notice it because most online forms don't have anywhere for the Organization to go.  I only noticed the extra address when Firefox used it as part of my mailing address when I placed an order online.  Then I had to think to figure out where Firefox had gotten that 'Organization' -- I realized that I had typed that phrase on a website form a few days earlier, but certainly not in any field labeled ""Organization"" and I certainly didn't tell Firefox to save it. </p><p>I need to use autofill to fill out online forms -- There are several forms that I fill out once a day, but I also use autofill to fill in my name and address on a lot of other online forms where occasionally I need to type in some of the data.  This seems to be when Firefox just decides it ought to keep whatever it saw me type. </p><p>I like Firefox and have it as my default browser, but I have noticed that Chrome and Opera both do a better job of filling out online forms </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-690;,firefox,other,en-US,1253008;1253098;1254070;1254097;,n4aof,"id:1254097,created:2019-09-22 04:58:04 -0800,updated:2019-09-22 04:58:04 -0800,creator:n4aof,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks for letting me know that I'm not alone or crazy -- now if we could just convince the developers to fix the problem, because it is a problem. </p><p>I actually cannot imagine how anyone could have created that dialog box and not realized that it needed a third choice </p> id:1254070,created:2019-09-21 23:51:00 -0800,updated:2019-09-21 23:51:00 -0800,creator:ajpeavler,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have the same problem.

Curiously, this other T450 which runs Xubuntu 18.04 (LTS) does not manifest the same issue. This system also uses Firefox as its browser. </p><p>I was advised to check the system logfiles. The only mention of anything likely in the logfiles is the xsession-errors file: </p><p>(xfce4-panel:1291): xfce4-panel-CRITICAL **: 21:01:45.450: panel-window.c:2245 (panel_window_active_window_geometry_changed): expression 'WNCK_IS_WINDOW (active_window)' failed. </p><p>(/usr/lib/firefox/firefox:1631): dconf-WARNING **: 21:01:47.129: Unable to open /var/lib/snapd/desktop/dconf/profile/user: Permission denied [Child 1577, MediaDecoderStateMachine #1] WARNING: Decoder=7f15d3e94c00 Decode error: NS_ERROR_DOM_MEDIA_FATAL_ERR (0x806e0005) - RefPtr&lt;mozilla::mozpromise&lt;refptr&amp;lt;mozilla::mediatrackdemuxer::samplesholder&amp;gt;, #1]="""" &amp;gt;="""" (0x806e0005)="""" -="""" 1577,="""" 3309="""" &lt;="""" [child="""" build="""" decode="""" decoder=""7f15d3e94c00"" detached.:="""" dom="""" error:="""" file="""" firefox-69.0+build2="""" firefox-9jl5vx="""" is="""" line="""" manager="""" media="""" mediadecoderstatemachine="""" mediadecoderstatemachine.cpp,="""" mozilla::mediaresult,="""" mozilla::mediasourcetrackdemuxer::dogetsamples(int32_t):="""" ns_error_dom_media_fatal_err="""" p="""" refptr&lt;mozilla::mozpromise&lt;refptr&amp;lt;mozilla::mediatrackdemuxer::samplesholder&amp;gt;,="""" true&amp;gt;="""" warning:=""""&gt;&lt;/mozilla::mozpromise&lt;refptr&amp;lt;mozilla::mediatrackdemuxer::samplesholder&amp;gt;,&gt;</p><p>Reference to my post on the Ubuntu forums: <a href=""https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2426276"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2426276</a> </p><p>I'd greatly value any help to solve this issue.

The two work differently. </p><p>Both are located in the Firefox installation directory, so they will be applied to any profile that loads that version of Firefox. Where they differ is how they work. </p><p>The policies.json is used to control certain functionality. For example, you could use it to disable Private Browsing mode. If the policy that you are using has an associated preference related to it, the user shouldn't be able to change that. </p><p>For example, setting the homepage using policies.json will mean that the preference on the settings page is locked and the user can't change it. There is a full list of the policies <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">published on here</a>. </p><p>The AutoConfig gives you a little more flexibility. That allows you to control anything listed in the <code>about:config</code> preferences. You could lock the preference so that it can't be changed. You could set the default so that it resets to a different value. There's a little more control that way. </p><p>If you lock a preference, generally it will also lock the associated setting listed on the regular Firefox settings page, but not always. It depends on what you are trying to lock. </p><p>Generally speaking, it's easier to lock stuff using the policies.json file, if what you are trying to do is listed there. </p><p>But to answer your main question, the user shouldn't be able to modify things that are controlled using policies.json as long as it's correctly configured. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Going along with that, I've gotten the ""We just need to restart FF"" page many times also.  Then, instead of actually restarting, I get the dialog forcing me to create a new profile, which it then runs.  Then I have to find the profile list, start a browser with my real profile (which I've carefully saved at this point), and then kill off the instance with the new profile.  I can't figure out how to get out of this cycle.  I've turned off automatic updates, but something  (??) still seems to be updating automatically.  When I check the app contents, I can see that some files/dirs have last-modified times corresponding to the update times on the support page, so something really does seem to be happening.

In my picture, shown above, of the ""about:policies"" page, I could see that I had an active policy for Flash with the default set as ""true"", but there were no URLs listed with that setting like there were in your picture of the same page. </p><p>So I had to find what was different. The policies.json file was correct, or at least I got it correct following the several suggestions on how/what URLs should be used, thanks to TyDraniu and others. (I am also using the ""Enterprise Policy Generator"" add on offered by Mozilla and found here.. <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enterprise-policy-generator/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/fire.../enterprise-policy-generator/</a>) </p><p>As it turns out I saw a ""blurp"" somewhere in my research on this issue that said in effect that if you have any other Group policies set to affect Firefox then the policies.json method will not work. </p><p>I double checked with our GP group and they said they are not doing anything in GP that would effect Firefox. </p><p>So my next step was to go to the registry.  </p><p>But first a little history on the systems.... </p><p>The PCs that I am setting up are for student use and are kept ""frozen"" via ""DeepFreze"". That means that, once frozen, anything that is done on the system, program or OS updates, for example, are lost when the system reboots. This protects the systems from problems such as malware installation, accidental file deletion or corruption etc. But it also can cause a lot of wasted network bandwidth and user time every time an update, gets installed. So when MS forces updates on you or in my case Firefox, which seems to have an update every few weeks, starts bugging the users about installing it, or on its own, by default, installs an update, it all gets undone on restart and is needless to say a BIG waist of PC and Network resources.  </p><p>So I looked for ways to stop Firefox from updating or notifying you about updates, since for NO GOOD REASON, they don't provide a simple ""Do Not Look for nor Install Updates"" option I can easily find and check in the ""options"" area.  </p><p>One of the options I found which seems to work very well is a registry adjustment which when combined with a few ""about:config"" settings stopped Firefox from advertising available updates and downloading and installing them. </p><p>The reg setting is as follows.... </p><p>Go to... </p><p>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies </p><p>Add a new key called ""Mozilla"", then under that another one called ""Firefox"". In that key add a DWORD called ""DisableAppUpdate"" and set its value to 1. (See attached picture) </p><p>It is that registry setting that was causing my problem. Once I deleted it, the entire ""Mozilla"" key and everything under it to be exact, the ""policies.json"" method started working and I now had the targeted URL listed in the ""about:policies"" page just like jscher2000 did in his. (See attached picture) </p><p>This is the ""policie.json"" file I finally got to work to let Flash activate without a prompt on the desired web site. </p><p>{ </p><pre> ""policies"": {    ""FlashPlugin"": {      ""Allow"": [        ""<a href=""https://campus.ahima.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://campus.ahima.org/</a>""      ],      ""Default"": true    }  } </pre> <p>} </p><p>Now I had the problem of Firefox updating itself and/or bugging the user to update it, while the system is frozen, back. </p><p>Fortunately, thanks to the ""Enterprise Policy Generator"" add on which had an option to stop the Firefox updating in it I was able to generate a new ""policies.json"" file which would handle both of my needs. It is shown below... </p><p>{ </p><pre> ""policies"": {    ""DisableAppUpdate"": true,    ""FlashPlugin"": {      ""Allow"": [        ""<a href=""https://campus.ahima.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://campus.ahima.org/</a>""      ],      ""Default"": true    }  } </pre> <p>} </p><p>Now I have exactly what I need. </p><p>Hopefully in the future NO ONE ELSE will every need to do this because Mozilla WILL STOP BABY SITING US and will return the ability to simply check ""allow always"" for flash, and/or for these ""exceptions"" which can be pre-programed in to the profile etc. and WILL ADD in a check box or boxes in the ""option"" area where I can tell it to NEVER EVER UPDATE OR TELL ME ABOUT UPDATES, which is how it should have been designed to start with.

Of course, i cannot guarantee where any extension, particularly legacy extensions, might store data. I don't know if even now that Firefox forces any particular compliance.

The program itself is unaffected. I have never had an issue.  </p><p>You can always compare the contents of an unused profile with that of your old or backup profile and discern the differences. In short, it will likely be different for everyone, and i couldn't offer any rules, except that ""modern webextensions using local storage should probably have a folder /moz-extension+++... in the profile.""

Someone would need to write an external program which can recognize and sort all these things, or... you can just zip up a copy of a profile occasionally, and then try to figure out which folder has the extension data you need for a restore if something breaks.  You can always pull stuff out of a backup piecemeal. Just bookmarks. Or logins. Or data from one or all extensions. <em>Preservation</em> is key. Sorting can come later if necessary.  </p><p>Maybe Mozilla will eventually support all the things in Sync. Which they should, if they are offering it, especially for extensions <em>which they themselves offer also</em>. No brainer, really, especially for a complex pile of settings like multiaccount containers. Maybe they will also extend the webextensions API. Maybe they might cause things to be labeled clearly for consumers, like, idk, having webextension data folders use the ID/GUID of the extension...

It seems modern webextensions should use an indexeddb somewhere in the profile's /Storage folder. Which used to be browser-extension-storage. And was probably different several time before, in the history of how the now-<em>legacy</em> extensions were handled, and handled themselves. </p><p>For an easy one, as you seem to be asking specifically about uBlock Origin, you can export rules right from the extension itself, which would be the best way to go about that, as you can import your ruleset the same way. The intended uBlock method. </p><p>For multi-account containers, it's easy to find the extension itself, like most other extensions. You can even look it up in Troubleshooting Information (aka about:support).  But in determining the storage, these do not seem to use GUIDs, but something random. I had for one install instance moz-extension+++aecff3f3-9fc0-4731-b046-3c8b622cb4f5^userContextId=<em>xxxxxxxxxx</em> Some extensions have more than one folder, one without ^userContextId=, and one (or more) with an ID. </p><p>Even looking into the database files is, so far for me, unenlightening. Backing up everything that is local storage for extensions  (moz-extension+++...) would be a good bet.  (The rest are probably site Form &amp; Search history items, or and other things which use local storage not in cookies.)  </p><p>Containers.json in the root of <em>every</em> Firefox profile folder (they were sure you were going to use this extension, apparently) contains only the description for the menu.  </p><p>I personally like to back up a whole profile, as logins, bookmarks, and all are pretty important to me and i have not lost anything since before there was a Firefox (or the short-lived Phoenix, or Firebird branding...).

I don't think they would invest the extra time to test with add-ons, though, so for that we're probably on our own. </p> id:1252532,created:2019-09-16 10:34:32 -0800,updated:2019-09-16 10:34:32 -0800,creator:jdpennmd,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Not helpful if Firefox isn't working to make itself compatible with all websites, at least those that have been identified as not compatible. </p> id:1252514,created:2019-09-16 09:49:58 -0800,updated:2019-09-16 09:49:58 -0800,creator:BUGFINDER,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Dear jdpennmd, Some websites only support certain browsers for their own reasons.

1268819,2019-09-14 09:26:24 -0800,2019-11-12T23:13:03Z,Playing 1080p 60 fps video on YouTube is choppy after the update,"<p>I am a longtime Firefox user, have been using Firefox as my primary browser for more than 7 years. My problem is that after updating to version 68 and later, 1080p 60 fps videos in YouTube stopped playing properly. The audio works fine, but there are a lot of dropped frames. In fact almost all frames are dropped. I used to have Firefox 62.0.2, and then directly updated to version 68. Currently I run version 69.  Please note that this problem does not occur with Firefox version 62.0.2 (I reinstalled it and checked the same). I noticed this problem only with 68 and later. Also, this problem does not occur in Chrome, or any other browser for that matter. Moreover, this problem is only with 1080p 60 fps, because 720p 60 fps or even 1080p 30 fps work just fine. I have tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned in Mozilla Support articles, including clearing cache, disabling extensions, using safe mode, refreshing Firefox, reinstalling Firefox, using a new profile, and updating Firefox. None of the steps have worked. I ardently request someone from the Mozilla community to help me. This is the first major bug I've faced individually. If this is not fixed, I have to go back to an older version of Firefox till an update probably fixes this. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-690;,firefox,other,en-US,1251997;1252031;1252126;1252150;1266379;,preetodeepdev,"id:1266379,created:2019-11-12 23:12:31 -0800,updated:2019-11-12 23:13:03 -0800,creator:preetodeepdev,updated_by:preetodeepdev,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Guys, this problem has resurfaced again after updating to Firefox 70.0.1.

To my mind, MY PRIMARY EMAIL ADDRESS IS:- <em>[REDACTED BY MODERATOR]</em>.  I do not know where you got the gmail address from, it is very rare I use it, except in answering your non-existant, technicians.  WHY? Do you only use volunteers to get people like me sorted out????   What is wrong with employing people that have been trained to sort out this type of problem.  When ever I click on ""CONTACT US"", all there is, is a list similar to that which led to that page?  There are NO LINKS that take me where I want to go, not where YOU want me to go. I am 71 next month, and I NEED SPECIFIC instructions as to what I have to do.  I have had a computer eversince the AMIGA 500.  So I do need help to sort out what I want, NOT, as you keep saying, I must have what YOU want.  If you cannot sort this out, I will be going elsewhere.  I have used firefox for bloody decades.

Defeats the purpose. </p><p>There is no app that I know of that does this.  Seems so simple.  Maybe in About:Config page there is.  There was an app that did this but no longer compatible with FF 69. </p><p>This isn't that complicated. Just keep the active new tab static to the LEFT permanently.

Please confirm,"<p>I brought up the Firefox browser, went to the Drudge report, clicked on a news story, and instantly I got a orangeish red page claiming my browser was infected, call this number immediately for support. My computer is being hacked, or something to that effect, and my bank account files are being stolen.  OK, I tried to close the page, but everything is dead, as in a fake page. Seen these before long long time ago so in order to close it I brought up Task Manager and closed the process tree.  Reopened the browser and it was instantly there again. Closed the browser with task manage and ran a McAfee virus scan, CCleaner, and CleanMyPC. Tried again, same result. Checked windows update, same result. Everything is up to date.  </p><p>I then called Verizon to confirm the phone number that it was trying to get me to call and Verizon confirms it belongs to Mozilla Firefox support. That seemed odd to me given the type of screen I'm dealing with is a scam screen that cannot be closed nor left unless you close Firefox with task manager. </p><pre>Took a chance and called the number, gets an error message instead as in the number is no good. Double checked the number and is the same one that Verizon had just told me goes to Mozilla Firefox support.  </pre> <p>In case you're interested in that number: 833-830-7966 </p><p>I then started Firefox in safe mode.

Thanks for the effort though. I appreciate the reply.  </p><p>The situation is exactly as I described it. I only found out what was going on because of contacting you folks via this website and the second call I made to Verizon. The first call to Verizon was customer support. The person at customer support apparently did the same thing that the person at Verizon tech support did, but failed to make her in-depth look at the information she was giving me.  </p><p>When I called back I called for tech support instead. Tech support looked into it and found the same things the person at customer support did, but he took the time to research what is what and explain it. </p><p>1) I did NOT tell customer support initially what the phone number was allegedly going to in my initial call. I let her tell me where it went to.  </p><p>2) The second call was to tech support. The tech followed the same methodology, but explained what he was doing along the way. The first check is to see if this is a Verizon number. It is not. The second check is to see if the number is legitimate to another company. Area code wise it is, but that's where it ends. The third check is to look to see if there is any mention of it anywhere else. Turns out there was and one of those mentions is in fact  something billing itself as ""Mozilla Microsoft support"". However, what the customer support person didn't realize was that ""Mozilla Microsoft support"" is mentioned in some sort of scammer reporting website. Hence the ""25 second Raspberry"" comment that one of the individuals reporting it stated.  </p><p>""I agree with others that the Verizon tech support person probably did not even bother to search for that phone number in a search engine site like Google. You may have mentioned Mozilla or Firefox at some point and the person just said yes that is their phone support."" </p><p>Not only is this not accurate, I've had lots of experience with Verizon and to the last person they have been absolutely great, helpful, forthcoming, in no rush to put you off, and I wouldn't do business with them were they not like this. I have never been gaffed off by anyone at Verizon. In fact, Verizon does go out of their way to check things out and since the scamming industry has been exceptionally hot this last decade in the phone calls made from spoofed phone numbers while claiming to be everything from the Internal Revenue Service, to Medicare, to your credit card company, and beyond, Verizon has made every effort to get on top of fraud as best they can with having both hands tied behind their backs with governments getting in the way. Hence why I know I can count on Verizon when anything regarding a questionable phone number comes up, via experience. In this particular area they even beat AT&amp;T and I had AT&amp;T religiously from 2016 back to before the Ma Bell breakup when we had Zenith phone numbers and Party Lines that used distinctive rings to tell you whose house the incoming call was supposed to be going to.  </p><p>Trust me on this, with the problems currently happening today due to scammers, I check everything and with computer experience back to writing script in MSDOS 1.1 on a Tandy 1400 FD laptop in the early 80's you get to have witnessed a lot over the last few decades. That's why I quickly recognize an old scam screen when I see one.  </p><p>As to how this happened initially, I simply brought up the Drudge Report which I frequent daily to get up to the moment news. I clicked on a ""video"" link regarding the Democrat Debates which was supposed to have been a YouTube link to a story. Instead I got hit, which wouldn't be the first time someone piggybacked a script on a legitimate URL for a redirect. A  similar instance occurred during the Superbowl many years back for a link to the Superbowl commercials. </p><p>On another note, due to a reply from someone else that seems to want to assert that I had some weird motivation to bring my query here by stating the following words: </p><p>""Also since no link was provided to what this was no one can help or verify the legitimacy of this posting. "" </p><p>""Verify the legitimacy of this posting""? It seems rather odd to me that anyone making such a detailed accounting, and requesting information, is so falsely accused without one shred of evidence and God only knows what would motivate such a thing to be done in the first place.   Further, that same individual magically determined that I spend my time going to some weird websites. </p><pre>This comment: ""In the end stop going to black sites or offsites that can't be verified as legit sites or spoofed sites."" </pre> <p>That was on top of obviously having zero clue of what they were trying to speak of and making up garbage along the way.  </p><p>Frankly, aside from actual moderators who obviously didn't do this, getting someone like that posting a response to me and with that kind of content threw me completely off. When I came here for answers I expected professional courteous help be it from volunteers or not, not some stinking troll.

Hadn't even thought of that being the reason why it kept coming back. I suspect you might be right. However, I checked the history and it was already empty. Possibly something from the Safe Mode log-in did this?  </p><p>As for the phone call with Verizon, I seriously doubt that was the case. They didn't know who or what company I was having the issue with when I asked them to check that phone number. Since 833 area code is a Toll Free section they checked it for me without hesitation. That tells me someone is guilty of fraud if there is no ""support"" number for Firefox. I'll contact Verizon again to confirm that number again and inform them of what's happened if I get the same answer as before.  </p><p>Update: Just now got off the phone with Verizon tech support. Verizon tech support confirms 833 area code is toll free, but nothing in their system connects it to Firefox and it allegedly goes to a cell phone. Also, the phone number is spoofed. Further, when researching it out the tech did locate a website that has it listed as ""Mozilla Microsoft support"". Which obviously doesn't exist. Additionally, the website is mentioned as a scam as well and billing itself as: ""<a href=""http://Techscammersunited.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Techscammersunited.com</a>"". Nothing like truth in advertising.  </p><p>NO, I did not go to that website. Momma raised no fool. </p><p>Hence the initial contact with Verizon appears to be the result of the customer support person giving me information gleaned in a cursory instead of an in-depth.  </p><p>If it's any consolation, the Verizon tech started laughing when reading up on it as someone reported that they called these scumbags and gave them a ""25 second [long] Raspberry"". </p> id:1251843,created:2019-09-13 19:13:45 -0800,updated:2019-09-13 19:13:45 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>You can use ""Forget About This Site"" if you still have a history item. </p><p>You can set this pref to 0 to always show the Session Restore page in case of a crash or when you use the Windows Task Manager to force a shutdown. </p> <ul><li>browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes = 0 </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox</a> </li></ul> id:1251833,created:2019-09-13 17:55:39 -0800,updated:2019-09-13 17:55:39 -0800,creator:Chris_Ilias,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi John, There is no phone number for Firefox support.

1268708,2019-09-12 19:25:34 -0800,2020-02-15T10:45:26Z,"Firefox says that it is being managed by an organization, but this is my own computer, and when I click to see active policies there is nothing there.","<p>I've asked on Reddit but I haven't found a fix for this yet so I'm asking here. In the settings for Firefox it says that my browser is being managed by your organization. But it has no mention of any settings being restricted, and when I clicked the notification to check the policy the page was entirely empty. I also checked the Firefox program folder and there wasn't any sign of an Autoconfic file that I could notice. One user mentioned on Reddit that this issue is often caused by antivirus companies forcefully inserting their own SSL certs to intercept your encrypted traffic, he then suggested turning off ""web scanning"" but my antivirus (which I only use Malwarebytes and Windows Defender) already had them disabled. After doing some research on my own I found out that the antivirus Avast used to cause this issue, and I had uninstalled Avast a while back, so I figured that the reason that the policy wasn't there was because Avast was uninstalled, but, I never saw this notification before today. So if anybody can help me pinpoint what this is and how remove it would be much appreciated. But all I really want to know if is this is something that I should be worried about or is it simply a bug. Also one other question is why the top sites and search bar is really close to the address bar after the latest update. Is this just a design change? Or is this something I need to be concerned about? Because I didn't notice this on Firefox on my laptop.

I launch a browser and print a request or go to a site on which there are no saved logins. And at some point the MP request appears, this is due to synchronization.

The ""New tab"" page (""top sites"" etc. page) suddenly became missing top margin (not centered vertically). This page displays broken for any Firefox profile (for Firefox instances of other users of the same Windows), so resetting (""refreshing"") Firefox is not a solution, and most simple Firefox reinstallation also did not help. </p><p>My desktop PC where the Firefox got this problem is maintained pretty ""default"" - Windows is strictly genuine out-of-the-box, there was no any errors caught of any custom settings invoked during any software installations, every software unit in Windows is free of charge (no stolen software at all), all hardware drivers are ok, I even do not use any realtime antiviruses (I roughly know at my 31 yrs old where malware comes from, and how to avoid its appearance). There are also no any add-ons\extensions\plugins\themes in my Firefox, and no Flash or Java installed. Of coarse, I even did not try to install Chromium or other WebKit stuff. </p><p>I will not surge any internal CSS of Firefox until I understand what exactly has changed there. I think that implicit ""300 px"" is not a solution for an adaptive layout design. I just want my about:newtab of anything else inside Firefox (not inside my Firefox profile, though) to turn correct back, so I ask for a simpler solution - as this is a common bug, and not my individual complex configuration business. </p><p>Does anybody here know anything more on this bug than I have already read above :)? </p> id:1251777,created:2019-09-13 13:27:54 -0800,updated:2019-09-13 13:27:54 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:2,content:<p>For code in userContent.css you need to include both about:newtab and about:home. </p> <hr> <pre>@-moz-document  url(about:newtab),  url(about:home) { /*place your code here*/ }</pre> id:1251652,created:2019-09-13 04:39:19 -0800,updated:2019-09-13 04:49:04 -0800,creator:tockity,updated_by:tockity,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:2,content:<p>I've noticed over the past couple days that all of my PCs have migrated to the top-of-page search bar.

How can you get a snapshot of a page auto-refreshing otherwise when that requires videoing it. </p><p>But then finding undocumented bugs is nothing new to me as I have been doing it for years including when Excel 97, SR2 had the following errors that got MS to send me Office 2000 free of charge as a fix to the below bugs: </p><p>1) A sum of more than 25 cells divided by a sum of more than 25 cells gave the result of ""1/0"" </p><p>2) No matter what settings were put on the legends of the charts within Excel, through the process of updating the numbers, that then updated the graphs, printed the charts, and saving the file all via a single macro, the legend would gradually work it's way to be in the top center position of the chart area. </p><p>3) Exceed more than 65,536 defined names within a single workbook and saved it as such, then close it out; the next time you open the workbook, everything except for data values and formulas would be removed from the workbook.  Not only that, but if the workbook had more than 32,767 defined names, some of the properties within the workbook may not work properly.  This issue persisted through Excel 2003. </p><p>These were just three of the bugs of Excel 97, SR2.  There were so many bugs within Excel 97, SR2 I had to deal with, I hated using that version and service pack.  I would have rather used Lotus 1-2-3, v2.3 (yep, that's the old DOS version prior to it going to Windows with v3.0), than to use Excel 97, SR2.  Just most people didn't notice the bugs because most people barely even scratch the surface of Excel.  Excel 2000 fixed many of the bugs, and as a bonus for just upgrading from Excel 97 to Excel 2000 without any modifications to my VBA codes, it only to Excel 2000 1/3 of the time it took Excel 97 to process the macros with the calculation mode set to manual in both cases. </p><p>As a general rule for me, which I have applied ever since grade school years, if something is proven to not work properly, I have a very high tendency to steer completely away from it (unless I have no realistic choice but to have to deal with it) and find other work arounds until it is otherwise proven to be fixed.  I been doing programming work ever since 7th grade when I was first introduced to computers on the programming side (BASIC programming language, that had line numbers) at a time when there were no mouse to use with the keyboard.  Yes, not a normal way to introduce someone to computers, and while my teacher didn't intend on teaching me programming, I picked up on it just by picking up on the patterns that I saw in the coding she had me type into the editor.  She was only attempting to help me out with my spelling and thought to try that not knowing if I would even pick up on it let alone how far I would take it. </p><p>This is one of those cases that I more or less have to deal with the issue for the following reasons: </p><p>Google Chrome has broken the autorefresh blocker add-in </p><p>Edge, forget it as I have had to deal with way too many security issues right from the start. </p><p>IE hasn't been as trustworthy to use as it is now a dead interface given MS is now focusing onEdge, but way too much stuff started popping up right from the start of using Edge, causing a lot of issues.  As such, Edge is essentially on the black list. </p> id:1251156,created:2019-09-11 11:06:13 -0800,updated:2019-09-11 11:06:13 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Can you attach a screenshot? </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem</a> </li><li>use a compressed image type like PNG or JPG to save the screenshot </li></ul> id:1251129,created:2019-09-11 10:14:09 -0800,updated:2019-09-11 10:14:09 -0800,creator:dodgester,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This option has been turn on for quite some time and it still does not stop the auto refreshing of pages that does automatic refreshing.

I know which I created but 1) someone hacked into my email and 2) when I went to log in to of course change passwords, I see this user name I did not create. Something like Gina2659 -- I see it show up but I put in the real name,  How did this come about? I did not create that.  How do i get rid of it?  Is there a way to get firefox to unremember it? I would appreciate un-doing it. Also, most important, someone of course accessed my email because a folder was created that I DID NOT CREATE and it was a ""send"" folder when I have a sendmail folder. I have no idea for how long, probably not long, but there were emails I sent months ago, MONTHS AGO LIKE MAY that I saw in that folder. I got rid of the folder and of course went through the process of changing passwords to my email, and am going to change this one, too. </p><p>Another issue: I do NOT EVER want a password for everything. How do I check to be sure this is not the case with the mozilla password I have? When I see the ""you did it! your signed in"" and then get firefox everywhere else"" Does that mean this password is used for other things in firefox? I only want a password for the browser which should also be used to get help, whether they call it firefox or mozilla. I think the one password that opens all is insanity. That is what google does. This is why I don't ever use chrome anymore.  It is why I make sure to change my gmail password every month. Why I cringe at even having to have it in my smart phone and why I will never gt another android phone. I appreciate your help and insight. (I ASSURE ALL, there is no way I created that folder, and NO WAY anyone else could have because I am utterly careful and NOBODY else can use this notebook unless they hack in.)

The thing is though that when I get to the customize window there are no icons present for the installed add-ons. The only thing there is a general add-on icon. I have attached that to the toolbar. When I click on that icon it shows me a list of installed extensions, but I cannot attach the seperate extensions to the toolbar. And from the list itself I cannot start any of the extensions. This is particularly problematic with the Enpass extension. If I can't start that I can't autofill my username/password for any of my logins that are stored within Enpass. Other extensions such as adblock just work by default, but this one doesn't. So unfortunately I still seem to be stuck.

I did a Firefox update on one of my laptops and it seems to have erased my saved logins. Since I have several computers it proceeded to sync the lack of passwords with all my other machines. I do have saved profile info from before the problem and so I pasted the profile info into the ""new"" firefox profile and all my passwords come back until it reconnects to sync and erases them back to where I started. I'm assuming that one of the machines I have is causing this. I've got 9 machines on the same sync. Any advice to help solve this would be appreciated. My bookmarks are fine and the usernames seem to be good. It's just the passwords.

Aunque volvemos a tener luz, la fuente está quemada. El equipo no arranca, la placa base no recibe corriente y no sé si habrá afectado a la placa base. Imagino que el disco duro C: no estará afectado, pero si se ha quemado la placa base, está claro que el disco duro C: lo voy a pinchar en otro PC en la tienda de informática donde vaya a reparar el equipo, y allí tendré que sacar los datos de firefox para cargarlos en otro equipo, por ejemplo en mi portátil. Ahora tengo dos problemas: 1) ¿Cómo recupero las contraseñas guardadas en Firefox y las meto en otro Firefox de otro equipo? No puedo encender el PC, voy a tener que navegar por el disco duro, así que necesito saber las ubicaciones concretas y qué ficheros exactamente tengo que copiar en un pendrive para ponerlo en otro equipo. </p><p>2) ¿Cómo recupero los favoritos? ¿Dónde están guardados los favoritos? Recordad que no puedo arrancar el PC y no puedo exportarlos. Tengo que entrar en el disco duro desde otro PC, navegar por dentro e ir a las ubicaciones donde estén guardados los favoritos. Copiarlos, y meterlos en el portátil donde tengo Firefox. </p><p>La verdad que estoy bastante asustado, os rogaría vuestra ayuda.

That is breaking lots of old rules. But there's no point talking in generalities about broken rules; as you know, userChrome.css is about details. We have to roll our sleeves and look at the rules. </p><p><em><strong>Reinstalling Firefox 69 (or 68 ESR?)</strong></em> </p><p>In a normal ""same channel, same program folder"" upgrade, Firefox should upgrade the existing profile. However, Firefox 67+ won't ""downgrade"" a profile by using it after it has been used by a newer version or a different install. If you installed Firefox 70 (beta/developer edition), it makes sense that Firefox 69 won't use the profile now. More info: <a href=""/en-US/kb/dedicated-profiles-firefox-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">Dedicated profiles per Firefox installation</a>  </p><p>You might be able to get the Firefox 69 installer to re-use the profile by removing a file named <strong>compatibility.ini</strong> in the profile folder. However, I haven't had the need to test that. The ""Dedicate profiles"" article also mentions a command-line parameter you can use to override downgrade protection. </p><p>If you want a version of Firefox that changes more slowly, you could consider switching to the Extended Support Release of Firefox 68. It will have stable features for about a year, with security updates at the usual pace. More info: <a href=""/en-US/kb/switch-to-firefox-extended-support-release-esr"" rel=""nofollow"">Switch to Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) for personal use</a>. </p><p><em><strong>Enabling userChrome.css in Firefox 69+</strong></em> </p><p>For profiles that never had a userChrome.css file before, in Firefox 69, you'll need to set Firefox to look for one at startup. That's the first point in my article here: </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-changes-userchrome-css.html#fx69"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-changes-userchrome-css.html#fx69</a> </p><p>This isn't necessary if the profile was upgraded from Firefox 68 to Firefox 69 (it's set to true already). </p><p><em><strong>The future of userChrome.css</strong></em> </p><p>As far as I know, there are no immediate plans for Firefox to stop loading the userChrome.css file in upcoming versions 70-71. </p> id:1251375,created:2019-09-12 05:58:18 -0800,updated:2019-09-12 05:58:18 -0800,creator:wolfe426,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I've been looking online and been discovering that some users are reporting that userChrome is being disabled by the new version of Firefox and that Mozilla is trying to do away with the userChrome.css file. When I tried reinstalling FF 64, multirow works. But, when I upgrade the 32-bit version to FF 69, Firefox demands I create a new profile and will not allow me to load FF without creating a new profile. </p><p>This also happens when I install the 64-bit version. I have no idea what the problem is with this. I've went back to using Opera as my main browser because it looks like Mozilla is disabling/removing more features that make it such a great browser. Plus, I've found that Opera loads much faster than Firefox. </p><p>What's funny is that FF used to be such a great browser until Mozilla started disabling a lot of the features that were very useful. I'll post the userChrome.css if you want but if FF is blocking or disabling the file, it wouldn't make any difference. </p><p>Before, FF was working great with userChrome, even with 69. FF 64 didn't require the userChrome.css file.

After two or three appearances, Firefox should add a checkbox at the bottom of the dialog to stop the site from showing more alerts. Check that box and click OK to block further dialogs. </p><p>(2) Authentication dialog (asks for username and password) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, the page may reload and immediately show it again. Pressing the Esc key numerous times in a row can cancel the reload as well as the dialog. </p><p>(3) Reacting to mouse movement </p><p>Some pages have a script that detects when you are moving the mouse pointer up toward the tab bar and takes action to show another dialog, or moves to full screen view to hide the toolbar area.

I'm just going to start with general suggestions. </p><p>If a site is generally known to work in Firefox, these are standard suggestions to try when it stops working normally: </p><p><strong>Double-check content blockers:</strong> Firefox's Content Blocking feature and extensions that counter ads and tracking may break websites that embed third party content (meaning, from a secondary server). </p><p>(A) Do you see a shield icon toward the left end of the address bar, near the lock icon? More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>. </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?"" Help &gt; Restart with Add-ons Disabled </li><li> (menu bar) Help menu &gt; Restart with Add-ons Disabled </li></ul> <p>and OK the restart. </p><p><em>Both scenarios:</em> A small dialog should appear. Click ""Start in Safe Mode"" (<em>not</em> Refresh). </p><p>Any improvement? </p>"

I am aware that the Firefox Default theme adjusts to the system theme automatically, but a minor difference between the Light theme and the Default theme (during the day) is that in the Default theme the tabs remain dark, as opposed to white in the Light theme (see uploaded images). I believe this is intended behavior, and somewhat a pet peeve for me, but nevertheless feel like there should be a workaround for this. Essentially, my question is two-fold: </p><p>1) Is it possible to edit the Default theme's light/day setting so that the tabs appear white as well? </p><p>2) If not, then I want to use the Light theme during the day and the Dark theme during the night, but want to auto-toggle between the two, similar to the case in the Default theme.

Try it after each action to see whether it is available yet. </p><p>(1) Large alert dialog (lots of text) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, it may reappear. After two or three appearances, Firefox should add a checkbox at the bottom of the dialog to stop the site from showing more alerts. Check that box and click OK to block further dialogs. </p><p>(2) Authentication dialog (asks for username and password) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, the page may reload and immediately show it again. Pressing the Esc key numerous times in a row can cancel the reload as well as the dialog. </p><p>(3) Reacting to mouse movement </p><p>Some pages have a script that detects when you are moving the mouse pointer up toward the tab bar and takes action to show another dialog, or moves to full screen view to hide the toolbar area. On these pages, the keyboard shortcut is essential. </p><p>Hopefully this will let you close problem pages without having to ""kill"" Firefox in the Windows Task Manager. (I don't recommend using that method because the tab will come back during automatic crash recovery anyway.) </p> <hr> <p>Often these scam pages are promoted through ad networks. As a defensive measure, you could consider using an add-on that is effective at blocking ads, such as: </p><p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/</a> </p><p>As with any content blocker, this will cause problems on some sites, so keep an eye on its toolbar button in case you need to make an exception to get a page to load properly. </p>"

He intentado varios pasos pero sigue igual. 1 – Inicié en modo seguro, por si el causante fuera un addon. 2 – Reinicié Windows (Firefox nunca me ha pedido reiniciar, pero por si acaso) 3 – Restablecí Firefox. 4 – Desinstalé Firefox con Revo Uninstaller, luego limpié con Ccleaner y busqué manualmente cualquier resto que quedase. 5 – Eso fue ayer, hoy he realizado una instalación totalmente limpia y me encuentro con el mismo problema; sin absolutamente nada, ni marcadores, ni configuración personalizada, ni addons, vamos tal como se instala y nada más. He probado a guardar varios marcadores, he situado el icono …….y nada de nada, deja meterlo pero no se despliega.

Based on upgrade-jasonlz4, it was installed 2019 0529. A screen displayed some information that I did not save and cannot find again. It indicated that my previous profile information was inaccessible but not gone, it could be used by running a older version of FF  and that now the profile info was stored on some Mozilla server and that I needed to create a account. This has been very disruptive. The only account I created was to be able to write this and the new FF seems to have created it’s profile in Firefox\Profiles. I have looked at the release notes for versions 66.0 thru 68.0.2 and don’t see anything about a new profile format or compatibility issues. I have Windows Explorer equivalent access to my restore points and see firefox.exe dated 6/10/2019 which differs from the upgrade file date but I could restore the system to that point. </p><p>So is it true that there is a profile compatibility issue and I need to use the old firefox to use the old profile?

Use some nice dude's tool at <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> to verify the old previous.jsonlz4 has my windows and tabs, and it does. </p><p>However, there is NO sessionstore.jsonlz4 in my main profile folder, only a bunch of files, which include sessionCheckpoints.json, the only file with any ""session"" in the filename. If I copy my previous.jsonlz4 to that directory (yes, using sudo) as sessionstore.jsonlz4 and run Firefox, it's blank as before, with none of the old tabs or windows. My suspicion at this point is that Firefox 68 on Ubuntu is doing something different than Windows, but I really have no idea.

If you mark the folder as read-only and then Firefox adds a new file into the profile (a temporary file, a backup, etc), then the read-only will get the black mark. </p><p>In addition, I believe there are also files that Firefox will constantly monitor and change back to read-only. This is because not every file can or should be modified. You can actually damage your profile by doing that. </p><p>Now, to address what I believe is the main purpose of your question: solving the ""Firefox is already running"" error. This is a common message to see when you close Firefox and start it up again. This is because there are certain tasks that Firefox needs to complete in the background even after you have closed it. </p><p>For example, it may need to save your session so it can restore it when you open Firefox again. This takes time, so opening too quickly can cause this issue. </p><p>That said, it's not normal to see this message if you closed Firefox a long time ago or if you are opening Firefox for the first time since your computer was turned on. </p><p>Common quick fixes could include rebooting your computer or trying to disable add-ons that may be slowing down Firefox and trying to run in the background. I don't believe that the read-only status of your profile folder has anything to do with the issue you are having. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Let me try again: </p><p>1.  I solved the ""Flash not working"" by downloading and reinstalling the plug-in from Adobe's website. 2.  I do see the Lego block.  In fact, it correctly has a little blue dot on it and at the same time there is a grey box on the page where the Flash content is, saying ""Run Adobe Flash"". 3.  Clicking on the Lego block <strong>or</strong> the grey box brings the pull-down option from the block, just as it always has when Flash was disabled (that used to happen periodically after an update). </p><p>Here is what changed, and which I hope <strong>someone</strong> can bring to the developers' attention: </p><p>There <strong>used</strong> to be an option for ""Always allow"" on the pull-down.  That is no longer there, in what I can only guess was the developers' zeal to disassociate Firefox with Flash.  But that causes a headache for users like myself. </p><p>I play Flash-based online games at Shockwave, UClick, and MindGames.  The way the option is now configured, I have to ""allow"" Flash on all three sites <strong>every single day</strong>.  (Screenshot of pull-down with restrictive choices attached.) </p><p>I would like, at the very least, an option to always allow Flash on specific websites, which the developers did not include as an option.  (I also think that in doing so, they improperly overrode my own authority as the end user.) </p><p>If I don't see such an option in an update -- if not the next one, than one fairly soon -- this is going to drive me away from Firefox. </p> id:1251869,created:2019-09-13 20:48:56 -0800,updated:2019-09-13 20:48:56 -0800,creator:tek360,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Sorry have been quite busy out of home so will catch up with this over weekend.

It is a big grey box that <strong>Firefox</strong> displays where the Flash content would be, with that ""Lego brick"" icon that denotes plug-ins and ""Run Adobe Flash"" under that.  The same icon also appears in the address bar with a blue dot, and clicking on either brings down the ""Allow/Don't Allow"" selection. </p><p>My feeling is that the Firefox developers took a harsh ""all Flash is bad, therefore we are going to disallow it even if the users hate it"" position.  Clicking on ""Allow"" should bring down another choice for ""Only this time"" and ""Always on this site"" and that is what I am expecting in a future update.  And if that either does not happen or the future turns out to be overly long, I'll be using something else. </p><p>I can't possibly be the only Firefox user who feels this way.  I didn't give the developers my permission to decide this for me without even asking for my input. </p> id:1250385,created:2019-09-08 15:11:58 -0800,updated:2019-09-08 15:29:02 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:cor-el,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This game is the same as I wrote above. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://zone.msn.com/gameplayer/gameplayer.aspx?game=mahjongtiles&amp;instance=default"" rel=""nofollow"">https://zone.msn.com/gameplayer/gameplayer.aspx?game=mahjongtiles&amp;instance=default</a> </li></ul> <p>Right-click in the blank area: This Frame -&gt; Show Only this Frame Allow the Flash plugin and then the game should load.

I can now zoom up to 300% in reader mode.  However, this is less than the maximum reader mode zoom that was achievable prior to FF69. </p><p>Based on previous troubleshooting input, I had modified the zoom.maxPercent; to 1000%.  Unfortunately, this only effects the normal mode zoom.  In reader mode, the zoom only goes to 300% in FF 69.0.1.  Although this is an improvement it is still less than the previous maximum zoom. </p><p>Also, the settings under the FF menu do not reflect the correct zoom level when in reader mode.  No matter what level you zoom to, the settings always say 100%.  The correct zoom level is reflected in normal mode though - see attachments. </p><p>If I zoom in to greater than 300% in normal mode, then switch to reader mode, the zoom level is retained and I can even continue zooming.  This seems non-intuitive though and a little kludgy. </p><p>In normal mode, if I zoom while the FF menu is displayed, I can see the zoom level value change.  This does not happen in reader mode.  If I zoom to say 540% in normal mode, then switch to reader mode, the value under the FF menu will say 540%.  However if I zoom up and down while in reader mode, the zoom value shown in the FF menu does not dynamically change as it does in normal mode.  Instead, the value remains the same as it was when the switch to reader mode was made.

This is an optional file Firefox reads at startup and applies to the web content area. Note that this would be separate from and ignore zooming, so it's not an ideal solution, more of a Band-Aid. </p><p>To set that, first, it's probably a good idea to experiment with the font size in the Style Editor. Here's how: </p><p>While viewing a page in the Reader View, open the Style Editor using either: </p> <ul><li> Shift+F7 <em>(you might have to cancel the Caret Browsing dialog)</em> </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; Web Developer &gt; Style Editor </li><li> (menu bar) Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Style Editor </li></ul> <p>Firefox should show two style sheets used by the reader mode. Click into either one, go to the end of the style sheet, and paste this rule on its own line: </p> <pre>/* Font size: normal zoom max is 28px */ div.container {   font-size: 36px !important; } </pre> <p>The font should become huge -- at least it does on Windows. You can experiment with the font-size value until you find one that looks good and make a note of that. You might want to try it on a few articles before concluding what works best with your display. </p> <hr> <p>To have Firefox apply the rule automatically every time you open the reader view, here's the next set of steps. </p><p><em>This assumes you do not already have a userContent.css file. If you </em>do<em> already have a working userContent.css file, you just need to add the rule under (A) to your file, and adjust the font-size as needed.</em> </p><p><strong>(A) Select and copy the overriding style rule code</strong> </p> <pre>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:reader){   /*** These rules only apply in Reader View ***/   /* Font size: normal zoom max is 28px */   div.container {     font-size: 36px !important;   } } </pre> <p><strong>(B) Generate and download a</strong> <code>userContent.css</code> <strong>file</strong> </p><p>Open the following page and paste the above rules into the editor, replacing the sample rule: </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/download-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/download-userchrome-css.html</a> </p><p>Adjust the font-size value as needed. Then change the file name selection to userContent.css and click ""Generate CSS File"". Save the userContent.css file to your computer. (See first attached screenshot) </p><p>Use the downloads list on the toolbar to open the downloads folder directly to the new userContent.css file. (See second attached screenshot) </p><p>Minimize (don't close) that Finder window for later reference. </p><p><strong>(C) Create a new</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder in your profile folder</strong> </p><p>The following article has the detailed steps for that (#1, #2, and I recommend #3) </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </p><p><em>I have videos for both Mac and Windows in case the text is not clear.</em> </p><p><strong>(D) Move the</strong> <code>userContent.css</code> <strong>file you generated in Step B into the</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder you created in Step C</strong> </p><p>You could copy/paste, drag/drop, etc. </p><p><strong>(E) Set Firefox to look for userContent.css at startup</strong> -- see step #6 in the above article. </p><p>The next time you exit Firefox and start it up again, it should discover that file and apply the rules to the reader. </p><p>Success? </p> id:1249598,created:2019-09-05 17:40:25 -0800,updated:2019-09-05 17:40:25 -0800,creator:rshboston,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Try zooming in non-Reader Mode first, then switch to Reader Mode.

Technically there is no real difference between the last RC version and the Release version, unless a major fault is discovered and the update gets pushed back at the last minutes before Release and another RC version is generated with 'fixes'.  <em>IMO, more likely to happen when a Release date falls the day after a US Monday Holiday weekend / 3 or 4 day weekend, as is the case right now. No one around the office to 'spin' a fix on Sat, Sun, or Mon.</em> </p><p>MacUpdate isn't the only website doing that; pretty common for Windows or general websites / software news sites to post a link to the last RC version as the Release version. But typically those other sites don't repackaged Firefox and include ""extras"" as MacUpdate has been caught doing. </p><p>Users can view the update schedule here: <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar</a> </p> id:1248728,created:2019-09-03 04:31:29 -0800,updated:2019-09-03 04:31:29 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello  StevenCee, </p><p>Maybe I'm overly concerned,  but I think you should download Firefox from the official download page only : </p><p><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release</a> </p><p>Here's why I'm so concerned : </p><p><a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/shouldnt-download-mac-apps-macupdate/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/shouldnt-download-mac-apps-macupdate/</a> </p><p>and : </p><p><a href=""https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/02/07/macupdate-served-up-mac-cryptominer-to-unsuspecting-users-in-firefox-onyx-and-deeper-downloads-on-feb-1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/02/07/macupdate-served-up-mac-cryptominer-to-unsuspecting-users-in-firefox-onyx-and-deeper-downloads-on-feb-1</a> </p> id:1248715,created:2019-09-03 03:00:33 -0800,updated:2019-09-03 03:00:33 -0800,creator:StevenCee,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Well, if they're rolling out on the 3rd, why is the new version available on MacUpdate already?

Part of the problem is that 68.0.2 does not really want to install in an existing .mozilla It botches itself. So I  let it start with a clean .mozilla, then updated my bookmarks from my json (direct copy of files also worked) backups and then tackled the passwords. </p><p>I had to create dummy passwords and then had to grep the entire directory looking which files has the password data. (It didnt follow the expected json path) It only wanted to be searched by hashes, so I had to create encrypted passwords. I then obtained the hashes using PasswordExporter. Once I had the password hash, I then grep'd for the hash to find where it really resides as hashes are always text readable. So then I could update the correct files with the old data. </p><p>Way too involved for the general user. I am not particularly sure if I will write a script to do all this for all the clients where firefox runs here. 68.0.2 is a real pain. At this stage Brave looks like a better seamless option with way less of these borked and willful issues  and I have a couple of months before everything must move to 68.0.2 so hopefully Brave comes out of Beta. It is way faster than firefox and plays videos firefox by default refuses to play the sound. Firefox plays e.g. some youtube videos but without sound while brave plays all of them I had trouble with. Lot of plusses for Brave and lots of Negatives for Firefox for me. I was always told by UGs that it is a driver issue and not firefox. Go figure Brave doesnt have these problems on the same machine..clearly it is a firefox problem all along. I dont know why firefox took this route   of dumping all this configuration on the unsuspected and mostly unskilled userbase with 68.0.2.

Clearly the old file uses a json file, but the new browser, if I save new passwords, none of the logins.json files changes size.  This means the new mozilla doesnt use logins.jason at all. Eeeew that is going to be difficult to find. I will have to write a script to compare filesizes of the entire .mozilla folder before and after I enter a new password in the new mozilla. Even then it will not be migratable as it seemingly does not use JSON. It is pretty clear no logins.json is uused in the newest firefox, which is probably why they createdthe big break and this catarsus of a problem.

Neither does it work for all the other terminals using firefox so it cannot be due to a simple misconfiguration. If I want to continue using firefox on all the terminals then I have to write a script to do the migration. This newest twist with firefox is creating a looooot of unnecessary work for me. At the mean time all stays at 68.0.1 until EOL, by which time I will have to make a drastic decission. Bookmarks, passwords and sessionrestore data is absolutely crucial. So far I could get bookmarks migrated, but passwords seems to be not possible at all. I wonder if the Master password must not be disabled first before migration.

The Alpha Nightly and Beta - Developer editions are IMO more suited to a feature such as that ""new Profile automatically created"" for the 2nd version.   </p><p>You should be able to open <strong>about:profiles</strong> <em>(typed in the Location Bar &amp; hit Enter)</em>  and view how many and which Profiles that you now have; and by using <strong>""Launch Profile in new browser""</strong>  button you can access your other Profile which has the user data that you think is gone or lacks compatibility. </p><p>You won't be able to ""import"" than data, but with the information that <strong>cor-el</strong> posted you might be able to pull your head out of the sand. </p> id:1248562,created:2019-09-02 09:40:21 -0800,updated:2019-09-02 09:40:21 -0800,creator:zimbodel,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1248530"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> You can copy files like these with Firefox closed to the current profile folder to recover specific data. </blockquote> <p>Thank you cor-el,  Will this work to migrate older version bookmarks and passwords to the current version firefox that is not backward compatible with previous versions? </p>"
