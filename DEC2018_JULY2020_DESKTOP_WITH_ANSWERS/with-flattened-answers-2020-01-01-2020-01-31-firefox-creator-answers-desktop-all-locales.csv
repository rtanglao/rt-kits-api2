Then I wondered if the issue I'm experiencing only pops up closing the exe in the normal User Interface way - click the ""X"".  Earlier today, after I'd posted my question, I came across a post using the <a href=""/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">Refresh Firefox - reset add-ons and settings</a>. While there, I switched over to gmail and Firefox became extremely slow and I became frustrated so I clicked Refresh, rebooted &amp; slowed again, so I Refreshed again minus the plugins &amp; I havent been able to recreate the previous issue, nor have I had any slowing. While trying to upload the images for here, Windows Explorer was doing a scan (I'm guessing for indexing) &amp; FF both were not responding. Explorer recovered, FF crashed.

This version of the knowledge base can only install the software provided in the app store, so it is much more secure, but it also leads to some inconvenience. I think that other versions of windows 10 are used for desktops, but if it's just a small book for emergency use during business trip and travel, it's enough to use windows 10s. After all, you don't need to install too many software, and there are no pop-up pages to disturb people when browsing, especially the security is relatively high, you don't need to install software killing, and the system won't be too bloated. Of course, Microsoft also provides solutions, specifically: Click special settings, open update and security, and then select activate. Then you can see an option to switch to windows 10 home (or other versions). Then click ""go to Microsoft Store"" below, and wait a moment, it should restart automatically, and then your Windows 10 doesn't have that S. </p> id:1286121,created:2020-01-31 07:24:57 -0800,updated:2020-01-31 07:24:57 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I think Windows 10S is restricted to applications in the Microsoft Store that use the so-called ""modern"" application interface style.

I personally have only ever downloaded directly from the Mozilla website and from no where else and I also have this issue.  On my different computers, on my ""about:preferences#privacy"" page in Firefox(v.77), I see this at the top: a little ""i"" inside a circle and immediately following that is ""Your browser is being managed by your organization.""   I don't like this.  I only have personal computers and no ""organization"" so that leaves me wondering by whom is my browser being ""managed""?   I would appreciate it if you would provide the answers to these questions: 1) if I have only one certificate active on my ""about:policies"" page, then did the Firefox install program put it there, and should there always be at least one certificate there on that page?  2) is that one active certificate the cause of users or me getting that ""Your browser is being managed by your organization.""  message?  3) most importantly for all of us users who are irritated by seeing that message: how can we easily get rid of it and stop our browser from being managed by someone else? I just want to not see that message.  And the reason that I would no longer see it, needs to be that no organization is managing my browser, unless it is Firefox or Mozilla itself. So, I have only one active certificate and it is identified as ""ImportEnterpriseRoots"" and then over to the far right of that name is displayed the word ""true"".  Is this something that should be there or needs to be there?   Was it placed there by Firefox?  If it is the cause of that irritating message, and if it doesn't need to be there, then would you please tell all of us how to easily delete it?  Firefox displays it there but I have yet to figure out how to edit or delete it as Firefox only displays it but does not offer even a clue as to how any further actions can be taken regarding it.  I just want to know how to delete or correct whatever is causing that message, please.

Can you explain how the value output is formatted? (E.g., would a string of comma separated values be similar?)  Does it work if you use the Edit menu and mouse instead? </blockquote> <p>Sorry for my cursory information.  I can tell you how to recreate the issue easily. </p><p>The report output is a simple .csv file, which is easily opened with Excel.  In fact, it is still easy to open with Excel, but we cannot manipulate it at all in Excel because we no longer have licensing and it will not let us.  Since we need to get the data into Sheets, the simplest option we had (for clinician users not very savvy with technology) was for them to open file with Excel, and then copy and paste the data into the pre-formatted report template.  (This report has one tab for the data, and another for the printable output that arranges the data and color codes things such as green/red for meeting or not meeting particular time goals, etc.) </p><p>Some of the output on the CSV file are date/time fields.  In Excel, when dates or date/times do not have enough room to display, Excel will show ###### in their stead.  The strange issue with Sheets is that if you copy and paste this information, Sheets will only get ###### and NOT the underlying date information.  However, if you paste values or use Ctrl+Shift+V, then the date information is correctly carried to Sheets.  Of course, you could also take the time to resize all the date columns so the dates display BEFORE copying and pasting, and that will also carry over the proper values, but like I said, these users can struggle with written instructions to press Ctrl+Shift+V, for example. </p><p>To answer your other question, no, using the mouse to click the Edit menu and select paste special and values only, or right clicking and doing the same thing directly into the cell also does not work.  All of these were working in Firefox just last week for me and my teammates, but we just discovered it stopped working this week.  These all work normally in Chrome. </p> <blockquote> The keyboard shortcuts should be operating according to the page, and Firefox shouldn't interfere with these. If it does, that's a bug, and well worthy of reporting. </blockquote> <p>I agree.  I can't tell if the end of my MS Office license somehow affected this change, or if something changed in Firefox, or if some strange group policy has been enforced.  It really feels (kind of conspiracy theory-like) that our transition to G Suite has caused several hidden things to be implemented to force us to use everything Google and to break any thing that could be considered competing software, etc. </p> id:1285375,created:2020-01-28 12:40:45 -0800,updated:2020-01-28 12:40:45 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>I don't have a good way to test this myself.

In fact I kind of know it's Win 10 because pretty much the same thing happens on Edge and Chrome :) Anyway,in Win 7 when you right click and select 'save as' [eg for a picture on Twitter] it saves the file literally instantly...but on Win 10 there's a slight delay,of say a few seconds,before it goes ahead and saves the file. I've tried tons of things that people suggest for this issue,like disabling every service that isn't absolutely necessary etc,disabling some of them fixes it for a short while,then the same thing starts again. Tried a couple of different anti-virus programs [I usually use Avast,I tried Panda and Bitdefender],it did seem a tiny bit better for a while with Panda...but only for a while. I tried several other things I saw in different forums,that I can't remember,none of which fixed it. So I reinstalled Win 7 on that machine...100% perfect,instant 'save as' function,just as it always was before [this lasted for whole 3 days I had Win 7 on there] </p><pre>I thought,well maybe it's that this old pc doesn't like Windows 10 or something,so since the pc was getting pretty old anyway I then bought a brand new 9th Gen i7 pc with 16GB RAM,installed Win 10 and it's exactly the same. </pre> <p>This problem does seem to go away if I reboot...but then it comes back an hour later...or 5 minutes later :) Does anyone have any idea at all what I can do to fix this? Or is this just normal for Win 10?  It's only a fairly small delay,not the 20-30 second delay some others are reporting,it's not the end of the world I suppose,but it's just really annoying,for instance if you're downloading a whole bunch of pics or something it's almost unusable.

When I get a chance, I'll go back to the one with this issue and see if I can post the ""troubleshooting information"". </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-720;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1284799;1284804;1285127;1285129;1285133;1286566;,star2387date,"id:1286566,created:2020-02-02 06:54:28 -0800,updated:2020-02-02 06:54:28 -0800,creator:star2387date,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hey Cor-el! </p><p>Short version: Good news - fixing permissions worked. </p><p>Long version: needed to set aside a chunk of time as there were several paths and time needed.  First, Apple issued an OS update in the last week and that took some time to implement.  Second, sadly several of the suggestions in the appletoolbox link don't apply to my OS sorry to say.   </p><p>However in the ""Reset Home Folder Permissions"" section, I entered into an admin account and followed the following steps to the affected user ""home"" directory applying to all the enclosed items: 1.    From the Finder menu bar, tap Go &gt; Home (or Shift+Command+H) </p><pre>2.   Choose File &gt; Get Info (or Command + I) 3.   Open the Sharing &amp; Permissions area (click the triangle next to it if you don’t see any information) 4.   Check that your home folder permissions are unlocked (look at bottom right for lock icon)  4a.      If you see a closed lock, tap the lock once and enter an administrator name and password to unlock </pre> <p>5.    Once unlocked, select the Action menu at the bottom left corner of the window and choose to Apply to enclosed items </p><pre>5a.       Select OK to confirm that action 5b.      You’ll see a progress bar at the top of the window as the action completes </pre> <p>6.    Once the progress bar finishes, open Terminal from Utilities folder of your Applications folder (or press CMD + Space to open spotlight search, and type Terminal and hit return) 7.    Paste or type this command in Terminal, then press Return: diskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u` 7a.        For US keyboards, the ` character is just above the Tab key 7b.       After entering the diskutil command, if Terminal says that permissions reset on user home directory failed (error -69841), enter chflags -R nouchg ~, then enter the diskutil command again:  diskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u` 8.    Once done, quit Terminal </p><p>This took awhile and once completed, I was not sure of the need of step 7 and did not apply step 7. </p><p>As a test, I tried to download and start Firefox from the admin account.  All worked smoothly. Rather than delete the program, I exited and entered into the other non-admin/standard account.  When I started Firefox (since it was already downloaded and installed from the admin account), the program did start - however asked for a profile. As previously stated, there were two active profiles: =&gt; default-release =&gt; NUser-2020-01-26  I selected the 1st one - default and program came up correctly.  Then I closed and restarted with the checkbox selected not to recheck the profile every time.   </p><p>Fingers crossed, but your suggestion to fix the permission seems to have been the random cause. Kudos and thanks! </p> id:1285133,created:2020-01-27 19:40:09 -0800,updated:2020-01-27 19:40:09 -0800,creator:star2387date,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Going back to an earlier suggestion to launch Firefox, my email has Firefox as default and when I inadvertently clicked a web link, the system tried (&amp; failed) to launch Firefox.

I'll try that next but may be tomorrow before I can respond back with results.  In the meantime, I'll also try another account on my same machine to see if that also points to the same permissions corruption as a cause. </p><p>Thanks! </p> id:1285129,created:2020-01-27 19:17:03 -0800,updated:2020-01-27 19:17:03 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Did you check for (write) permission issues ? </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://appletoolbox.com/2016/07/fix-corrupt-user-accounts-macos/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://appletoolbox.com/2016/07/fix-corrupt-user-accounts-macos/</a> </li></ul> id:1285127,created:2020-01-27 19:11:50 -0800,updated:2020-01-27 19:11:50 -0800,creator:star2387date,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Did you create the second and third profile in the list recently ? &gt; Yes --3) ""RT"" profile shows creation date of Dec 19 and that fixed the problem then.  2) When I was unable this time around, I deleted all the profiles from the pop up panel and created the new one - as seen by the date in the name - NUser-2020-01-26.   </p><p>What profile was used most recently if you look at the time stamps of files in each profile folder?  &gt; All three show ""modified"" date of 1/26/20  </p><p>Can you start Firefox with the 3vfgb4wx.default-release profile as that would be the preferred profile for a Firefox release ? &gt; Launch default-release profile - how?

When trying to click on the menu items such as Add-ons or Options that open a configuration page, or typing in the address bar about:(whatever), I get no response at all too. The only exception is when I click the Help-&gt;Troubleshooting Information item in the menu.  This one alone loads the page in a new tab normally. </p><p>And in the same tab that the Troubleshooting Information loaded, I am able to load other configuration pages by typing about:(whatever) in the address bar.  Opening a new tab to type in about:(whatever), however, will result in Firefox giving no response just like before. Also at this point, menu items like Add-ons and Options that before had been returning no response when clicked, will now open up new tabs that load the list of add-ons or the various configuration options like normal. When it comes to regular webpages, however, after I click on Help-&gt;Troubleshooting Information and enter a website url into the address bar of that same tab, Firefox will show the spinning wheel, but will never load the webpage. </p><p>In addition, when I exit Firefox, where before updating it only took seconds, now it will take minutes before the firefox.exe process closes. </p><p>All of the symptoms described above DO NOT occur when I boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.  Firefox will run normally and properly load all kinds of configuration tabs and webpages using my regular old profile. </p><p>I had tried many of the other suggestions on the support site, such as creating a new profile, refreshing Firefox, reinstalling Firefox, downgrading Firefox to 50s &amp; 60s versions, reallowing Firefox on my firewall software, and even uninstalling my firewall/antivirus software, yet none of them had helped.  I am still able to have Firefox properly run in Windows 7 Safe Mode but go haywire in Windows 7 Normal Mode. </p><p>If anybody has any idea what is going on, then any help is appreciated.

In my case, I installed a parallel downgraded version and the addon's won't work in either version.  </p><p>Hope things are clear, sorry if I repeated my self.

Unfortunately I cannot test this method because I managed to fix it myself by restoring my profiles folder from the day before, so I cannot vouch for this solution. But I do think you are exactly on point and this may be worth looking into. The only problem I see is that many of the files in appdata/mozilla/firefox/[default profile] were overwritten by the older installation of firefox. This means both the old version and the new version of firefox are using the same profile folder. Maybe this could be solved by creating a new profile, and going through the steps in this thread to restore functionality to the updated version.  </p><p>All is good on this, can be marked as closed, or solved, or however that works. </p> id:1284752,created:2020-01-26 15:12:54 -0800,updated:2020-01-26 15:12:54 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>You can check for problems with the extensions registry files in the profile folder. </p><p>Try to to reset the extensions registry and rename extensions.json (extensionsOLD.json) and rename/remove previously used extensions files like extensions.ini and extensions.sqlite when present and rename/remove compatibility.ini in the Firefox profile folder with Firefox closed. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles</a> </li></ul> <p>New files will be created when required. </p><p>See ""corrupt extension files"": </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unable-install-add-ons-extensions-or-themes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unable-install-add-ons-extensions-or-themes</a> </li></ul> <p>You can check for possible updates in case of issues. </p> <ul><li>click the cogwheel button (left of the Search bar) on the about:addons page to ""Check for updates"" </li></ul> <p>If this didn't help then delete add-ons.json and possibly prefs.js in case there is a problem with preferences. </p><p>You can use the button on the ""Help -&gt; Troubleshooting Information"" (about:support) page to go to the current Firefox profile folder or use the <b>about:profiles</b> page. </p> <ul><li>Help -&gt; Troubleshooting Information -&gt; Profile Folder/Directory:<br>Windows: Show Folder; Linux: Open Directory; Mac: Show in Finder </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles</a> </li></ul> id:1284741,created:2020-01-26 14:53:17 -0800,updated:2020-01-26 14:53:37 -0800,creator:shiftededge,updated_by:shiftededge,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I found one solution to this problem. </p><p>I noticed in my appdata/mozilla/firefox/profiles, there was no profile for the older version of firefox, but my default profile, developer profile, and beta profile were all available. This told me I should try and look at the profile folder and decided to first try and do a previous version restore (on Windows 7, right click&gt;properties--previous versions tab, select the date prior to installation of FF 49.02, and press restore). This will only work if you have the option to maintain previous versions set on windows. Luckily I caught it the day after; it might not work if it's been longer.  </p><p>For those who can't restore previous version, or if it didn't work, you'll probably want to investigate the default profile folder. I looks like the older version may have overwritten some files in the existing one. We know the extensions are actually loading into firefox, but they can't be enabled. So that's beyond the scope here, because I managed to restore my entire profile folder after which all my extensions were re-enabled and firefox works properly now.  </p><p>I won't be running the old version anymore, but was able to find a portable version of 49.02 which doesn't overwrite your profiles.  </p><p>I'm now setting regular backups for my Firefox profile folder. </p><p>The only problem is, the main reason I wanted to use the 49.02 was to use it with a specific version of iMacros which could help with speeding up the process of uploading Redbubble, and when loading the redbubble login page, it doesn't work on 49.02. This is not part of the original question, I'm just adding info since those seeking to use this method will be disappointed. What I did manage to find out about this problem (using the inspector (f12 key) and the MadeWith extension) is  find out that the actual login input uses something called React. As far as I can tell is this is a type of javascript, but I can't find any information on whether or not it's compatible with older versions of firefox. I'm going to be trying to record a new macro and see how that goes. </p> id:1284695,created:2020-01-26 11:42:05 -0800,updated:2020-01-26 11:42:05 -0800,creator:shiftededge,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you </p> id:1284691,created:2020-01-26 11:28:01 -0800,updated:2020-01-26 11:28:01 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I wouldn't go digging to deep into this right now.

You can permanently or temporarily rename the folder (e.g., firefox_moz) to keep it separate from a concurrent distribution from Mint. If you plan on not using the Mint distribution of Firefox, you can uninstall it <em>before placing new Firefox in the default folder</em> with $ sudo apt-get remove firefox.  This does not affect profiles. </p><p>In whichever order suits you: Open the archive and extract the firefox folder. Open your file manager as root so you can move or copy/paste the firefox folder to /usr/lib/. Optionally rename if you like. Copy the path to the executable for /usr/lib/firefox/firefox. </p><p>- You can start this copy of Firefox, let it make profiles if it is going to, then use <strong>about:profiles</strong> to select your original profile and set it as default, if you want. You can delete any others you do not want.  </p><p>Launcher: </p><p>Warning: Wordy, but trying to cover anything i can think of. </p><p>Create a launcher wherever you like, then you can add it wherever else you care to if you want more than one (desktop, launcher on panel, in applications menu, in a dock, etc.). </p><p>Not sure which DE you are using with Mint, and i have not used Cinnamon or MATE but i used Gnome way back and all of these follow the same sort of convention. E.g., you should be able to right-click the desktop and Create Launcher, or right click a panel and Add Item. </p><p>For the launcher itself, give it a Name you like. If you are only planning to keep one installation of firefox, then firefox will do. If you add text to the Comment section, this will be included in any mouse-over text. Add the full path to the executable for your Command.  /usr/lib/firefox/firefox %u (The exec argument %u is for passing a url to the program, e.g., clicking a link in a document which is open in a different program.) Icon: I don't know how you will be offered icons, but generally you get a list of standard icon types.

If you like the native FF icons, select Image Files (or a similarly named entry) and go to /usr/lib/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default48.png (Up to you and your screen, etc., but 48 will likely work out well in most uses.)

1278281,2020-01-25 17:16:52 -0800,2020-01-25T17:16:52Z,firefox has stopped working,"<p>When I first load firefox I have been getting the error ""Firefox has stopped working for a few years now. Close the program"". I do not click the link to close the program I click the ""X"" at the top right of the popup window. That will initiate a reload of the page. But, the page loads with none of the graphics loading. If I click the refresh button myself my page will load just fine. The only reason I even did an upgrade was because it would not let me load ANY page and kept saying my flash player was out of date and had to be updated.  I did update flash but Firefox would still not work. A couple months ago I tried to do an upgrade which crashed. I ended up doing an uninstall and installed the latest version. I lost everything including my profile. After much searching for answers using Google Chrome I finally found out how to retrieve a copy of my old profile and help on how to install it. I did an upgrade this week which I had to do from Google Chrome but at least it worked and I didn't have to lose anything. But, then it would not use flash so I had to again use Google Chrome to get flash to download and install the correct update. You know... all that NPAPI and NPAPI crap because Firefox uses a different version of flash player than Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. I  am currently using version 72.0.2 of Firefox. I had installed an update for Flash player before updating Firefox. I had to reinstall the version of Flash that I had just installed. I am now running version 32.0.0.321. Firefox still stops working and I still have to jump through the hoops of reloading it. I am NOT going to update my Windows 7 Home because I do not want Windows 10. If I try to update my graphics card MS will force me to upgrade Windows. They stopped supporting Windows 7. The only good thing is that now it does not open the library item on boot that even after following instructions to turn off kept loading anyway. All that installing and reinstalling eats up a lot of my metered data allowance so the next time I will probably just uninstall Firefox. I forgot to say that NO I DO NOT OWN A SMART PHONE AND DO NOT PLAN ON GETTING ONE. MY DESKTOP PC WORKS JUST FINE. I DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD AN APP EVERY TIME I WANT TO DO ANYTHING. If using computers for the past 40 years has taught me anything it is all about putting money in someone's pocket and making it easier for thieves to destroy my life. I am sorry that the youth of today are stupid and want things to be easy and do not realize the expense to their very existence.  I do not want you to fix anything. I apologize for my attitude. I just needed to vent. </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install;fix-problems;escalate;firefox-720;firefox-7202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gpolkadot1,""

I use it to convert Youtube videos to mp3 music files. But recently some not welcome things have been happening. When first accessing the site to the site, I get a popup that Popup Blocker did not block. I added the site to their list with mixed success. When clicking the Convert Now box in ytmp3, another window opens up. Screen shots provided of the site with the Firefox results, and the Norton 360 results. Is it ytmp3 causing this, or something within Firefox that I can fix? I am using the latest version of Firefox. Version 72.0.2. Windows10 with all current updates installed.

And in the moments it isn't spiking it's only using like 30 to 40% so it is more than able. </p><p>Edit 1: It's really strange because I just watched 4k60 videos and 1080p60 videos in both VP9 and AV and they worked just perfect and then I went to a 1080p24 in VP9 and it skips like hell. And then I went back to the previous video and it gets almost 100% skipped frames at 4k60 when just 5 minutes ago it was playing it fine. </p><p>So basically I can't successfully reproduce the problem the same way all the time. Maybe you guys have some tools I can use to do more in-depth testing. </p><p>Edit 2: I am now convinced that the problem lies with the iGPU not having enough memory because one common thing that I noticed every time there's skipping is that the vram is pretty much full. At the same time that's strange because the system should then use the system memory as shared memory, right? I checked my BIOS to see if I could increase the iGPU memory but it literally only gives me a single option, which isn't even the correct one since it shows 128MB and I have 256MB, or at least the specs of the laptop, Firefox (about:support) and Windows says so. </p><p>I know there's other laptops with this iGPU that can change that so if anyone has one that can test that we would know. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-720;firefox-7202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1292669;,M4xc4v413r4,"id:1292669,created:2020-02-23 06:37:17 -0800,updated:2020-02-23 06:37:17 -0800,creator:jyc860923,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Not exactly like yours but I've discovered on my 3400G with Vega 11 graphics, on Youtube only the 4K 24P videos judder on the 60Hz display, clearly improper 3:2 pulldown is to blame, Chromium based browsers use a lot more GPU 3D power (90%, GPU 1650MHz, Dual DDR4 3333Mhz) than FF but they get the job done. </p><p>I'd say with your Vega 8 GPU, 1080P should be EZPZ, unless you're having stability or memory issues.

Promazání pomohlo, ale nevím na jak dlouho, protože jsem opravdu zvyklej otevřít nový panel, na kterém je „group speed dial“ a na něm zvolit stránku, kterou chci navštívit. Tzn., že je „group speed dial“ zobrazen při každém otevření nové stránky, takže vlastně nejčastěji ze všech stránek.

Then i <em>exported </em>the data in Win10 from Chrome to Firefox. Again, this did not go smoothly (i couldn't <em>import </em>to Firefox from Chrome) and it took a few attempts.

They are in folders named xxxxxxx.default and xxxxx(myname)old-xxxxxxxxxxx (with no suffix in the folder name). </p><p>about:profiles tells me that the profile in use is (myname)old. So i presume this is the profile from the root directory (under Appdata\roaming.....) from which i should copy the files to the usb? </p><p>This profile contains both key3.db AND key4.db. I presume all i have to do is copy logins.json and key4.db to the USB? </p><p>Then in my newly installed FF on my win10 system i copy these two files into the profile (under Appdata\roaming.....) created by FF during the installation?

Even with only 1 process.,"<p>After 72.0.2 I started to notice performance problems with my firefox. Symptoms are similiar to my multiprocess problems I had after it was added. I managed to avoid it for some time by limiting processes number to 1 (which was 4 in reality) </p><p>Long story short: when you open new tab firefox has to create new process which is somewhat correlated to your PC performance (however it hangs up even on 4800MHz i5 with nvme pci-e 3.0 x4 ssd so....). When this process is already created and you enter different website it is smooth - firefox does not have to create another process until you open NEW TAB or it reaches its limit (from 1 to 8 processes/tabs) - set via settings.  If limit was set to more than 1 I had problems with hanging up for few seconds until I reached limit - so if it was set to 4 I opened 1 tab and 3 links I clicked (with new tabs) slowed firefox down for me, but 4th, 5th etc. were fine. So I set it to 1 permanently and problem disappeared - every tab opened as fast as before. </p><p>But now problem seems to have returned. I still have 1 in my settings but symptoms are pretty much the same (but there are only 4 processes). However browser is not hanging up - it seems like connection is. It does nothing - ""waiting for xxxxxx"" in lower left corner and then after 1-2s page actually starts to load.

Thanks for both your inputs. A fresh start once more tonight with no issues has reassured me that it was simply a glitch. </p> id:1284145,created:2020-01-24 08:53:55 -0800,updated:2020-01-24 08:53:55 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">Start Firefox in Safe Mode</a> {web link} </p><p>A small dialog should appear.

Only work in 'Private mode',"<p>I am a Quickbooks Online user. Recently, my Firefox browser updated to 72.0.2 (64-bit). Now, after the update, when I attempt to go into my Quickbooks Online account and create a 'new' estimate or invoice, the menus work, but after clicking, nothing opens. I'm not very familiar with web design, but I believe they are Java based menus. If I click one of the links that directs to an outside website, they work fine. I've noticed the same thing on other websites, gemlux marine boat parts is another. Same thing, clicking in a menu does not open the link. </p><p>Lastly, when shopping on Amazon, if an item has an option (like sizes, colors, etc), and I click on the different size or color, it does not update the item page and price like it normally does. In other words, if I have a $20 item in size SMALL, and hit the drop down to change it to a size LARGE which should be $10 more, the price change does not show in Amazon's price menu. I found that if I click the 'large' in the drop down, leave it, and refresh the page, the page loads with the 'large' size selected, and then prices it correctly.  </p><p>For whatever reason, if I switch to 'privacy' mode, it works fine. </p><p>I have used all of these websites frequently in the past year, and only in the last week has this started occurring.  All of these websites work just fine in Chrome, IE, Edge, etc. </p><p>I prefer Firefox, so I'd like to get this figured out. It's probably something simple, like a Java setting...but that's over my head. </p><p>Thanks in advance Shawn </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,websites,en-US,1284023;1284037;,riggedrightmarine,"id:1284037,created:2020-01-23 19:22:33 -0800,updated:2020-01-23 19:22:33 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>If you use extensions (""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Extensions) that can block content (Adblock Plus, NoScript, Disconnect, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin) always make sure such extensions do not block content. </p> <ul><li>make sure your extensions and filters are updated to the latest version </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems</a> </li></ul> <p>Firefox shows an highlighted shield icon at the left end of the location/address bar in case Tracking Protection is blocking content. </p> <ul><li>click the shield icon for more details and possibly disable the protection </li></ul> <p>You can check the Web Console what content is blocked. </p> <ul><li>""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Web Developer </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop</a> </li></ul> id:1284023,created:2020-01-23 17:59:34 -0800,updated:2020-01-23 17:59:34 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi riggedrightmarine, It's probably more simple than a Java setting.

Apple Users </p><p>Before wiping your computer, make sure to back up important files to an external drive or the cloud and disable iCloud features, such as Find My Mac, Messages, and Apple Music. </p><p>You should also copy your keychains to a flash drive. Transferring these collections of account names and passwords onto your new machine will save you the hassle of re-entering the WiFi password at the local coffee shop or the login info for online retailers. </p><p>Begin your factory reset by restarting your computer. During startup, hold down the Shift + Option + Command + R keys until the Apple logo appears. This will reinstall the operating system that came with your Mac. (Alternatively, you can hold Command + R to reinstall the latest MacOS installed on your Mac or Option + Command + R to upgrade to the latest version of the OS compatible with your computer.) </p><p>Once you've done that, the Utilities window will pop up in the middle of your screen. Open the Disk Utility and erase your built-in hard disk. Make sure to select the disk, not the volume name listed beneath it. Then select MacOS Extended (Journaled) format and quit Disk Utility when the process ends. </p><p>To finish the reset, navigate back to the Utilities window and choose Reinstall MacOS (or OSX) to reinstall the original operating system. </p><p>After the reinstall, the Mac will begin the setup process. This should look familiar if you've set up this computer before. If you’re selling your computer, you can skip setup by pressing Command + Q and let the new owner complete that process. Chromebook Users </p><p>Chromebook users have the easiest time wiping their laptops. Unlike Apple and Windows users, most of their files are already stored online, in Google Drive. So there's little to back up before you begin the process. </p><p>To start a factory reset, click on your account photo. Open the Settings menu and scroll down to the Advanced section. From there, find the Powerwash section and click on the icon. This will prompt a restart, which will flush away all your personal information. </p><p>If you're ready to sell or donate the computer, don't log back in—the next person who logs in becomes the Chromebook's primary user. Windows Users </p><p>It's important to back up all of the files on a Windows computer to an external drive or the cloud before beginning a factory reset. </p><p>Also, find and save the serial numbers for Office Suite and other software using ProduKey or a similar app. You'll need them to reinstall the applications on your new machine. </p><p>The process for resetting your PC differs slightly for each version of the operating system. For Windows 10, go to the Start Menu and click on Settings. Then navigate to Update &amp; Security, and find the Recovery menu. Next, select Reset this PC and choose Get Started. Follow the instructions to revert your computer back to when it was first unboxed. </p><p>You’ll be asked to choose whether you want to erase data ""quickly"" or ""thoroughly."" Opt to erase data thoroughly. It’ll take a little longer, but it makes it more likely that your data is deleted permanently. While there’s no absolute guarantee the data can’t be retrieved after a reset, this simple step increases your security. </p><p>Once you perform a full factory reset, then the Firefox set up will run smoothly. </p>"

(No stable on this mac - yes mac). I want to remove from the address bar, the 2 icons taking up space in the address bar, that I never use. Do I need to create a user file .css? I can if nec. The 2 icons are to the L of the addr. bar 1- ""no trackers known..."" &amp; 2- ""verified by amazon"". The ""remove"" context menu item is grayed out.   -What I really want is to SEE the address I'm typing into the address bar, when FF is NOT in full monitor pg mode. 23"" W monitor &amp; I often have FF in only 1/2 of the full monitor (so I can see another non-related window at same time). But only the down carot is visible in this ""1/2 mode' status &amp; I can't see anything of what I type, nor anything in the address bar already. I use the address bar search like 99% of the time &amp; I really like this shortcut! (If it was fully useful, in 1/2 mode, even more). My guess is that removing those unused icons will allow more space in addr. bar to see what I'm typing -- right?

(Although the problem crops up with tabs as well.) </p><p>Sometimes 20+ windows open.  </p><p>Firefox has a long known history of eating memory to the point that it slows down your computer. (And causes a lot of other issues when  it happens as well... new windows are black, other pages stop responding, etc.)  </p><p>Firemin helps with this whether you're in single or multi-process. But regardless, firefox will start slowing down even though the task manager says firefox isn't using much memory. (The ""Rammap"" windows utility will show a huge chunk of memory used but not attached to any program though.)  </p><p>The fix then, is to close firefox completely, then restart it.  </p><p>You can do this by either right clicking the Firefox icon in the task bar and selecting ""close all windows"" or by going into task manager, click the firefox.exe line, and then ""end process"".  </p><p>When you restart firefox it's fine for a few hours. Just ""restore previous session"" and all your previously open windows come back. You don't generally lose any work. </p><p>This works absolutely fine <strong>IF</strong> you have disabled multi-process in firefox.  </p><p>But it's very different when multi-process is running.  </p><p>Firefox slows down..... you go to the icon and close all windows, and only SOME of them will close. You do it again, a few more will close. Eventually, you'll get them all closed.  </p><p>Then when you restart firefox, only the very last set of windows you closed, will restart. The rest are gone. You have to go into history and start trying to find the ones you remembered having open. If you opened them several days ago, it will take quite awhile to find them all as you're going back days..... you could have opened hundreds of windows since that one you want was last loaded.  </p><p>This is because when you ""close all windows"" it's only closing the windows in that one process running when you perform the function.  </p><p>And there might have been 10 processes running.  </p><p>Task manager is no help as the exact same thing happens. You go to task manager and see say 10 instances of firefox.exe running. You can click one and then ""End Task"" but you'll still have 9 open. Close another, 8 open. Etc. etc. until you finally close the last instance.  </p><p>Then when you restart firefox the only windows you can get back are the ones that closed with the last instance of firefox.exe you closed in the task manager.  </p><p>The problem seems to be that every instance (or ""process"") runs on it's own, independent of the others, and ignorant of the others. The only common connection seems to be the task bar icon that shows every window with one click. (But no idea which process is running which windows.)  </p><p>It's likely possible that the coders can ""link"" the processes in some way so that if you close one of them by force (either ""Close all windows"" in the task bar or ""End process"" in the task manager) it will cause them all to close at the same time. And hopefully remember ALL the windows you had open when you did it.  </p><p>I'm surprised that others haven't run into this. Or if they have, not complained about it. Most of the complaints I hear say that multi-process slows down computers a lot if they have lower tier processors (like older Intel Core 2 duo) or lower amounts of RAM. (less than 4GB.) </p><p>In my case I the slow downs are very noticeable after a couple of days and I'm running an Intel i7, 3 GHz processor and 12 GB of RAM. </p> id:1290215,created:2020-02-14 12:14:41 -0800,updated:2020-02-14 12:14:41 -0800,creator:magelord,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>the-edmeister <a href=""#answer-1288222"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Did either of you guys even try what Fred McD posted here - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277948#answer-1283385"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277948#answer-1283385</a> - about turning off Firefox program updates via <strong>Policies</strong>?

Also another one from github where you go into windows advanced settings and create an environment variable that should prevent updates.  </p><p>The first of the two above didn't work. The second one did work but other issues cropped up. (Can't recall now what they were.)  </p><p>The third one (advanced environment variable) did work as well but caused a lot of other issues. (The person that posted that fix, indicated it would and he'd seen a few as well.  </p><p>What it boils down to is that I don't like the idea of messing around with external settings trying to override the internal ones coded into Firefox. Too much chance of running into other issues.  </p><p>The proper fix is for Mozilla to put the ability to turn off updates back into Firefox because it will be (hopefully) coded correctly so that it doesn't ""break"" other things.  </p><p>And as I've mentioned, the updates were only one issue for me. The inability to turn off multi-process is also a problem for me. Along with other more subtle issues that seem to have ""broken"" a number of sites I use. The most evident being the text editors used in the better known forum software apps. The newest (70 to 72) updates disabled the standard editing codes that were passed on to the sites.  </p><p>IE: Ctrl-B (bold), Ctrl-I (italics), Ctrl-U (underline), etc. etc. One site owner and I spent days trying to figure out if vBulletin had made changes to their code to filter out the editing controls. Then I finally got an answer from someone on the vBulletin support forums that they were getting reports of this problem, only from  Firefox users, and only those using version 70 and above.  </p><p>I switched back to version 62 and that fixed every issue I was running into. I can completely use the editors on every forum I use, I can turn off Firefox updates and, I can force Firefox into single process rather than multi-process.  </p><p>See next post for WHY I want multi-process turned off. </p> id:1288432,created:2020-02-09 03:19:41 -0800,updated:2020-02-09 03:19:41 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I posted the links to stop the updates.

Just a thought. </blockquote> <p>I've been using Firefox since Firefox exist, and I never minded to have it always up to date. Unfortunately Firefox 72 is an absolute trash. It's ultra slow, unsafe, it crashes a lot, displays all sites wrongly, most common features no longer work, it's unspeakably hideous, that's why many people are trying to stop this update. </p><p>I managed to reinstall Firefox 71, it works great, but it's so stupidly design that every single time I open Firefox it asks me to update. </p><p>I really enjoyed Firefox for many years, and I'm really trying to continue to use it. But they are making it really hard and I don't even understand why they try so hard to force users to update for a broken version. </p> id:1285799,created:2020-01-30 04:30:54 -0800,updated:2020-01-30 04:30:54 -0800,creator:magelord,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I'm wondering if - at least as far as the update issue is concerned - this isn't a potential liability issue for Mozilla. </p><p>IE: By making it impossible to turn off updates, no one can blame Mozilla for their computer being attacked.  </p><p>I'm more of a ""personal responsibility"" guy where I feel that if I turn off the updates - and get into trouble because of it - that I've got no one to blame but myself.  </p><p>But I realize that not everyone is, and court cases to defend yourself can get expensive even if it's a slam dunk you'll win.  </p><p>Just a thought. </p> id:1285599,created:2020-01-29 09:51:38 -0800,updated:2020-01-29 09:51:38 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>Magelord <a href=""#answer-1285585"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> My ""fix"" was . . . .

I'm reluctant to totally abandon it because there are many add-ons and plug-ins that I don't think are available in other browsers. And I use a number of them.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the standard ""canned"" answer for forcing updates is ""security issues"" but they don't tell you what security issues, which would allow you to make an intelligent choice to update or not. (Before they took the option away.) </p><p>I still trust FF to give me better privacy than any others. (Chrome in particular, simply because it's a google product and google is rampant about ""monetizing you"" in every possible way.  </p><p>Hopefully Mozilla will return the options to turn off updates and multi-process with a future release but.... considering the number of complaints about both of them - not just here but across the entire web - I'm not holding my breath. </p> id:1285585,created:2020-01-29 08:43:45 -0800,updated:2020-01-29 08:43:45 -0800,creator:magelord,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>Paulgi <a href=""#answer-1283454"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> wow! looks like Firefox got even worse than I first thought :o <strong>I'm surprised that they really <em>forgot </em>to add a way to completely disable the unwanted updates.</strong> that's a really bad software development.  thanks for the help. I'm going to try to do it. </blockquote> <p><br> They didn't ""forget"". It was intentional. Along with making it impossible to turn off running in multi-process.  </p><p>There is a trick to block the multi-process in advanced windows settings using a specific environment variable to block it. But it causes other issues.  </p><p>If this truly is a ""community"" then they are ignoring the many complaints about both issues.  </p><p>My ""fix"" was to go to the section where you can download every Firefox from the very first version. I downloaded 62.0.3 which is the last version where you could still select to not even check for updates. If you're only bothered with multi-process problems then the last release of version 67 works. (But since you can't turn off updates you'll end up right back to version 72 as soon as you install version 67. (I tried.)  </p><p>Even with version 62, you'll find that as soon as you launch it after installing, it will be downloading the latest version and will automatically install it when you restart FF. The update option is pre-set to auto-update.  </p><p>So, for anyone choosing this step, download and install 62.0.3. Launch it... immediately go into &gt;tools&gt;options&gt;general, scroll to Firefox Updates, and click never check for updates. You can click check but let me choose however, you'll be constantly bugged when opening FF that there is an update to install. (Sooner or later you'll click the wrong box and update it. Been there, done that.)  </p><p>After this (DO NOT CLOSE FIREFOX YET) go to Control Panel&gt;Folder  Options&gt;View Tab&gt;and click show hidden files, folders.... </p><p>Now go to <em>C:\Users\&lt;yourusername&gt;\AppData\Local\Mozilla\updates</em> and delete the update that should be there. It will have a hexidecimal type file name. EG: 308046B0AF4A39CB </p><p>NOTE: &lt;yourusername&gt; is the name of your computer that should be visible when you're in the ""users"" directory.  </p><p>Close all the open windows and you should be good to restart firefox without it updating.  </p><p><br> Hope this helps someone. </p> id:1284591,created:2020-01-26 01:26:13 -0800,updated:2020-01-26 01:26:13 -0800,creator:paulgi,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It's not really solved, I'm still deciding on what to do.

But since I migrated to win10, I've been experiencing a trouble. </p><p>Back in my win7 environment, things were working as intended.  I went to ""about:preferences#privacy"".

And I ticked ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". Also I ticked all boxes on ""Settings for Clearing History"" window. All data seemed deleted when I closed Firefox back then. </p><p>But things were changed in a weird way.  The settings on ""History"" section is working but I've noticed some leftovers. All cookies are gone and you're logged out, but I noticed that some sites STILL have some settings.

I may try to make use of that Legacy profiles feature to see if it renders any changes. I'm currently using a policies.json to change policies however and this states that legacy can only be changed in GPO. Do you think I could use both to modify my policies? If not, I could try to replicate my modifications witihin my .json over to the GPO. Also how do I even use GPO?

It may be Joomla itself, although this does not explain why automatic login is possible if cookies are never cleared.

Theoretically, if the Joomla login box does not have a ""Remember me"" check box, one should never be able to login automatically. And any cookie (a session-only cookie) set will be blocked server-side and destroyed at the beginning of a session if it exists.

I use Whatsapp.web to chat when on my PC. I have no trouble connecting to Whatsapp.web using my Iphone and Firefox. However, EVERY time that FF closes, for a restart, or simply when I make a mistake and accidentally close the browser, the connection to Whatsapp.web is apparently broken. I say apparently because on the Iphone, it sontinues to list Windows 10 as an active device using the web app. When I used Microsoft Edge, once I scanned the QR code and connected, I would STAY connected, even overnight after I had shut down the PC. I am wondering if there are certain privacy or security settings which are preventing Whatsapp from staying connected when the FF browser closes. I also remember that a couple of years ago, when I was using FF in the 40s versions, maybe, Whatsapp also stayed connected. Just a note: the reason this is sort of a problem for me is that I am blind, and I use certain visual accessibility settings on Windows and FF that do not allow the Whatsapp QR to be scanned; so I have to change the entirevisual setting of my PC, scan the code, then restore the entire visual setting. Any ideas how to keep Whatsapp.web connected always, or at least as long as I don't end my Windows session? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1283122;1283196;1283402;1283485;1283541;1283610;1283719;,greene8097,"id:1283719,created:2020-01-22 21:58:52 -0800,updated:2020-01-22 21:58:52 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I hope this works better in the future.

I started looking for support and chose to uninstal v72 - shut down my laptop and restarted it. I downloaded the latest version and at the end of install - where 'run firefox' is expected - nothing happened. I have since uninstalled and downloaded the latest beta version (73) - and now, when I ask to run the program, it opens a window but all the tabs are 'dead' and no matter what I type, the program does not connect to the internet (i.e. Google search or direct to a known web address). If I select settings, I can see the drop-down list - but if I select 'Add-ons' (for example) - nothing happens. I attempted to run my laptop in safe mode, but I have no recall of the password needed to get past the login screen.

I have 500/500mbps fios, but for some reason, my downloads all download at about 700kbps and my uploads max out at about 7mbps. However, if i use chrome then the problem disappears (sort of, i still only get 200mbps max upload/download speeds). Ive already tried clearing my cookies/cache. and restarting Firefox. The issue is not with a certain website, but with all download/uploads across the board. The weird part is that i can upload several files and each will upload at 7mbps per file but they will never go above 7mbps. ive tried disabling my add-ons and nothing changes. If i check my internet speed on firefox, i do get 500/500 speeds, so i dont know what it could be. its not a big deal to have to switch to chrome whenever i want to upload/download something, but its something id rather not have to do. ive been using firefox for as long as i can remember and ive never had an issue like this. </p><p>Im using task managers performance tab to see the upload speed and using firefox's download icon to see the download speed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1282511;1282752;,shadowkon626,"id:1282752,created:2020-01-19 18:02:10 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 18:02:10 -0800,creator:shadowkon626,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>that doesnt help at all, i still want to upload things. </p> id:1282511,created:2020-01-19 00:40:53 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 00:40:53 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Go to the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Add-ons Web Page</a> {web Link} (There’s a lot of good stuff here) and search for a download manager. </p>"

1277697,2020-01-18 18:17:50 -0800,2020-01-18T21:44:29Z,Video playback issues,"<p>I am currently having issues with Youtube, Netflix, and <a href=""http://vrv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">vrv.co</a>, all video streaming sites over on Firefox, though only in full screen mode, and only on those particular video streaming sites, and I don't know why. As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser. Strangely, safe mode removes the issue, but again, not sure why. I did check another browser— Namely Waterfox Classic. That worked fine. And so far the only suggestion anyone has had from the tech service that I have on the machine has made that makes sense is that this might be a video driver issue. I did just recently update my drivers, this is true. However the issue did not start up until a few days after this had occurred. I tried reinstalling the driver to see if that would fix the issue.  The issue itself is very weird. It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop.  </p><p>Again, Waterfox does not seem to have this issue. At first it was suggested to me on another thread that the issue might be because Waterfox Classic doesn't use hardware acceleration, so I turned that off on Firefox. Which does allow things to play more or less okay, though at times when I scroll, it seems to mess with the screen in a similar fashion to the initial playback issues, and again, it's not consistent with that, just like it's not consistent with the video playback when the browser's Hardware acceleration is on. </p><p>However, I just learned that Waterfox Classic /does/ use hardware acceleration, though it seems to have a much lower content limit set by default. This makes me think that whatever is going on may be a glitch in Firefox itself that may have somehow come up. Though how and why I have no earthly clue, as prior to last Monday there was no issue, as I said earlier. More unusually sometimes the effect vanishes on videos where it's shown up.  </p><p>I have tried to screenhot this and it /never/ appears in screenshots, and doesn't show up when paused either. I've even tried to take a picture of it with my phone or record it with said. Also no luck. I /have/ however, been able to find a video that does this affect deliberately, so I can at least present it here. Again, this is not consistent, seems to move around the screen, and only seems to occur on those three video sites as I stated. Apparently whatever the issue is, it's /NOT/ something to do with the hardware acceleration, as I learned, again, that WaterfoxClassic /does/ use it and it is active in that browser, and was active when I first tried it, so that narrows it down to some kind of glitch either with Firefox or Windows and how it interacts with either the former or the latter, depending on where the glitch is coming from.  </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's causing this? </p><p>The image attached is an example of what I'm seeing, however, bear in mind that this video is /deliberately/ showing this effect in an attempt to replicate the type of thing one might see on old video tapes being played after years of disuse, but it /is/ the same general appearance, more or less, of what I occasionally see on Firefox when using the videos on the above mentioned sites. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-720;firefox-7201;,firefox,other,en-US,1282463;1282466;1282470;1282478;1282482;1282485;,Marc7,"id:1282485,created:2020-01-18 21:44:29 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 21:44:29 -0800,creator:Marc7,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>crankygoat <a href=""#answer-1282482"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled   -- I am not an expert on the Web APIs for media or anything else, but my guess is whether or not what capabilities the display reports are used along with other factors (the ability to decode the input, etc.) to determine what format video to send.  I would think it is not so reliably implemented yet that turning it off might help in some edge cases. (The whole Web API is constantly undergoing construction itself, as far as i know.)  Yeah, I'm sorry i misunderstood your comments regarding the hardware acceleration. Sometimes it is best to leave it off when it does not work properly in a given application, so some applications have a setting for it somewhere, if autodetection is iffy or it just may not work well. (Similarly one might choose DirectX or OpenGL for certain things on a system and in a program where they are both options, where one just may work out better.) </blockquote> <p>No worries. We learned that turning off the hardware acceleration seemed to be the best option when I brought the issue up in another thread, one related to Waterfox when I ended up getting sent to this help forum when I clicked on Waterfox Help after downloading Waterfox Classic. Not sure what actually makes it 'classic' compared to whatever is regular Waterfox. But yeah, someone had suggested turning off the extensions one at a time, and seeing if any of them was the cause of the issue. Now unless I did it wrong, as I would turn one off, restart the browser, and if nothing had changed, I would turn that back on and repeat the process with the other two, none of the extensions seem to be the problem. I was even able to test adblock plus on Waterfox Classic, and that clearly was not the <a href=""http://issue.No"" rel=""nofollow"">issue.No</a> script didn't have a counterpart that worked on it, and my Webroot filtering extension doesn't even come up on the thing. Plus, none of those had ever been a problem on Firefox up until last Monday at around 8 or 9 pm eastern standard time. Prior to that, everything had worked fine. I had updated Firefox to version 72.0.1 just a few days before, and also updated my graphics card's drivers, and the day after, I had just put through the latest optional update to Windows 10. So at least we can rule the latter out as the problem.  </p><p>Like I said, I have little idea what even caused the issue to begin with.  </p><p>Oh, if it helps, my video card is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965m. </p> id:1282482,created:2020-01-18 21:33:39 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 21:33:39 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled   -- I am not an expert on the Web APIs for media or anything else, but my guess is whether or not what capabilities the display reports are used along with other factors (the ability to decode the input, etc.) to determine what format video to send.  I would think it is not so reliably implemented yet that turning it off might help in some edge cases. (The whole Web API is constantly undergoing construction itself, as far as i know.) </p><p>Yeah, I'm sorry i misunderstood your comments regarding the hardware acceleration. Sometimes it is best to leave it off when it does not work properly in a given application, so some applications have a setting for it somewhere, if autodetection is iffy or it just may not work well. (Similarly one might choose DirectX or OpenGL for certain things on a system and in a program where they are both options, where one just may work out better.) </p> id:1282478,created:2020-01-18 20:49:43 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 20:49:43 -0800,creator:Marc7,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Incidentally, what is media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled? </p> id:1282470,created:2020-01-18 20:07:45 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 20:07:45 -0800,creator:Marc7,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Ok, I tried that, and it does not seem to have worked. I did notice a bunch of things were listed as having been modified and reverted them, but that didn't seem to help either. However, once again, turning hardware acceleration off in the browser does fix the video playback issue, but I don't know why. It also means I face a similar issue when scrolling— though again much like with the video playback this is entirely inconsistent, but that may just be the price of having video working without using a different browser.  And again, last week it was perfectly fine. Though to be fair, I believe I was on either version 71 or 72 of Firefox rather than 72.0.1 at that time, as I did an update to 72.0.1 a few days before this glitch started up. Reinstalling 72.0.1 didn't help the issue either.

The easiest way to do this is to go to the <code>about:support</code> page by typing that into the Firefox address bar. On that page, in the <strong>Applications Basics</strong> table, there is a <strong>Profile Folder</strong> row. If you press the <strong>Open Folder</strong> button in that row. </p><p>That should open the profile folder using the regular file browser on your computer. This is the folder were all of your bookmarks and other information is saved for Firefox to use. However, this is the folder that was cleared out when you refreshed Firefox. Leave this open so that you know where to find it. </p><p>Next, go to your desktop and open that <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder. In there are some of the old files from before you refreshed Firefox. Most notably, you should see a file called <code>places.sqlite</code> in that folder. That's the file that your bookmarks and history is saved into. </p><p>Now, it's going to depend on what you want to save. If you are only looking to save the bookmarks you had in Firefox, you can just copy the <code>places.sqlite</code> file from the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder and paste it into the profile folder (what we opened from the <code>about:support</code> page earlier). </p><p>If you want to try and recover everything you had before, you can copy the entire contents of the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder into your Firefox profile folder. </p><p>When copying stuff over, you will probably be asked if you want to overwrite files. If you have nothing on the current Firefox that you are running, you can overwrite everything without any issues. Firefox does need to be closed in order to properly replace all of the files, so make sure to copy or print these steps. </p><p>Incidentally, if you do happen to need to find this page again, you can find it under your Firefox Account profile for this website. When you go back to <code>support.mozilla.org</code> and log in, you can hover over your name in the top-right of the website and select <strong>View Profile</strong>. That opens your profile page and you can click the <strong>X Answers</strong> link on that page to see the questions that you have posted in. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1308119,created:2020-04-23 14:40:59 -0800,updated:2020-04-23 14:40:59 -0800,creator:robstowe,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have just bookmarked this page.......................  but bookmark folder is still empty </p><p>It is nothing like the set up before </p><p>there was a five subject click list at top left of screen.  no where to be seen now </p><p>now bookmarking [which doesnt work anyhow ] is acessed from the three books wi one falling down symbol :-( </p> id:1308117,created:2020-04-23 14:35:41 -0800,updated:2020-04-23 14:35:41 -0800,creator:robstowe,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>yes I do,  but what exactly do I do ? </p><p>its 10.30 I am going to bed but will not switch off lapto cos I am concerned I cannot navigate back to this page without bookmarking or history </p><p>Sounds mad tell me bout it </p><p>thanks for response but I do need step bt step I am not pc pro, old guy with failing memory strange but true </p> id:1308092,created:2020-04-23 13:34:06 -0800,updated:2020-04-23 13:34:06 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi robstowe! </p><p>Do you have the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder on your desktop?

I can live with the silly warning that Firefox is ""slow loadIng"".  What saves me from other similar situations is mostly that I keep all of my relevant bookmarks on external .htm pages and only those ""file:///c:/[groupname]/[filename].htm"" references are included in my bookmarks.  So I click on the group identifier in my bookmarks line, locate the specific site that I want to visit, and off I go.  This procedure is largely because I have HUGE NUMBERS of sites that I want to visit from time to time for various ""group"" reasons and I'm really not interested in sharing the multitudinous lists with anybody who might have access to my Firefox browser.  It's also because there are soooo many such sites that a Bookmarks line could not even conceivably show even the most important ones.

When creating my Firefox account I used one of these email addresses, and received a notification saying the verification email failed to send and was returned, and my account was locked out. Then I realized I forgot to enable the specific email address for my domain before trying to create the account, so I went and activated the correct address, tested it, and then tried logging in / creating my account again, but was just given the same 'locked out' error. </p><p>Can you guys unlock my account? I have the login information and the email address is working now, but the site just keeps saying that the verification email failed to send, instead of trying to send a new one or something. If you guys can't just unlock it, then it is fine if you can just reset it or completely remove it, so I can create it again with the same email, since the account was brand new and didn't have anything on it yet. </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-730;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1282350;1282385;1282429;,altgage,"id:1282429,created:2020-01-18 16:50:28 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 16:50:28 -0800,creator:altgage,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1282385"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> See: <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq</a> </li></ul>  <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li></ul> </blockquote> <p>I think it has been almost 24 hours so I guess I will try again in a little bit, but as for the other two links, I can't sign in to the account to even try those like I said in my post... </p> id:1282385,created:2020-01-18 13:35:56 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 13:35:56 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>See: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq</a> </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li></ul> id:1282350,created:2020-01-18 12:21:20 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 12:24:20 -0800,creator:altgage,updated_by:altgage,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Obviously it isn't the account I am posting on right now.

I have the Premium Ultra HD subscription. </p><p>For reference, I am running a computer with Windows 10 Pro 64 bit (version 1909), I have hardware acceleration enabled in Firefox, my content process limit is set to eight, and my computer has a dedicated AMD Radeon RX 470 dedicated GPU, running the latest stable driver version, 19.12.2.  </p><p>I've chatted to a Netflix representative and they pointed me to this page <a href=""https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742</a>, where it states that Netflix has a maximum quality of 720p when using Firefox.

This permission is certainly something that other people have been concerned/confused about before.  <ol><li> Theoretically, yes. While the extension won't have access to the past data that you've entered, it can see anything that loads on the page or is entered on the page while it's installed. There are some exceptions, like internal Firefox pages or Mozilla-owned pages, where extensions are not allowed to view the page. </li><li> No, when an extension is disabled, it's not running. Therefore, it can't see any websites. </li><li> Aside from the exceptions I mentioned in my answer to your first question, theoretically, yes. </li><li> Extensions don't have direct access to the passwords saved on Firefox, until they are entered into the website. So, if an extension is tracking a password text input box, then it could (theoretically) see the data that's entered. </li><li> Like you said, users should make sure to use add-ons they can trust. The majority of add-ons are not using this permission in a malicious way. </li><li> The add-ons in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/recommended-extensions-program"" rel=""nofollow"">Recommended Extensions program</a> are safe and trusted add-ons. They are ones that are not abusing the add-on permissions. </li><li> I'm not entirely sure about what you mean by ""contributions"". My assumption is that you are talking about donations. Many add-ons do collect donations to fund their efforts. Add-ons are designed and released for free to Firefox. Many developers also have websites that they run, where they may offer a download link to the add-on and have their own donation platform. </li><li> If an update for any add-on is released and it requires new permissions, you will be asked to approve the new permissions <u>before</u> the extension gets updated. If you don't approve the new permissions, the extension will stay at the last version. </li><li> Unfortunately, that falls on the user. You need to do research about the extension that you want to install. The Firefox add-ons platform does a pretty good job of filtering out and reviewing extensions, but ultimate responsibility falls on the user. </li><li> You'd be surprised how often an add-on requires that permission. Basically, the permission is required in order for the extension to see any of the websites that you visit. For example, I have a website blocking extension that I developed. It requires the permission so that it can view the link that's being loaded and compare it to a list of websites that the user has decided to block.

A regular program that you install on your computer could also access Firefox data, so you just need to be responsible when adding things to your computer. </p><p>An example that I like to sometimes show people is how easy it could be to get the password from the Facebook login page. If you go to the Facebook website (assuming you aren't logged in), you will get the login screen at the top. If you press Ctrl + Shift + K on your keyboard, you will open the Web Console, which will allow you to run code (similar to what an extension can do). If you fill in some fake login information (but don't click login) and type <code>document.getElementById('pass').value;</code> into the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> part of the Web Console and press enter it should show you what you have typed into the password field. </p><p>So, in theory, an extension <em>could</em> include the same code and run it on the Facebook page when you open it. Then, it <em>could</em> send that to the extension developer. Actually, that's basically how the builtin Firefox password manager and other password managers can collect this data to save for you (although, obviously they aren't sending the data to themselves). </p><p>I should also point out that just because a developer has added that permission to their add-on doesn't necessarily mean they are collecting anything. As a matter of fact, there are tons that don't send any data anywhere. The permission just allows the add-on to access the website content and information so that it can function properly. </p><p>While capturing passwords and other data could be a possibility, there are more legitimate developers than bad ones. </p><p>As for donations, many developers do use the donation button on their add-on listing page. The issue is that the add-ons page only supports a limited number of payment processors (<a href=""http://buymeacoffee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">buymeacoffee.com</a>, <a href=""http://donate.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">donate.mozilla.org</a>, <a href=""http://flattr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">flattr.com</a>, <a href=""http://liberapay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">liberapay.com</a>, <a href=""http://micropayment.de"" rel=""nofollow"">micropayment.de</a>, <a href=""http://opencollective.com"" rel=""nofollow"">opencollective.com</a>, <a href=""http://patreon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">patreon.com</a>, <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> and <a href=""http://paypal.me"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.me</a> at the moment). So, if the developer wants to use a different payment processor (perhaps one that offers lower fees), they need to have a donation page outside of Mozilla. </p><p>It's not necessarily bad. Usually they will use an assortment of processors, since the people donating to them may also have ones that they prefer over others. Provided the developer is using a trusted and safe platform, there's not really much need for concern. </p> id:1282133,created:2020-01-17 15:57:43 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 15:57:43 -0800,creator:jerry_chavez,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>Wesley Branton <a href=""#answer-1282112"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I myself am an add-on developer, so I'll try to answer all of your questions above to the best of my ability for you.

Are there any sync tools available (development or otherwise) with the capability to clear the sync server for a particular account??  I am quite sure that a Mozilla developer somewhere has that capability.  I can't help but believe that someone has develped tools to deal with situations where the sync data is corrupted.  This sync engine has been around for a long time.  </p><p>3.  Are there any 3rd party sync tools like xBrowserSync that could be recommended.  I probably wouldn't want to go in this direction for a variety of reasons but it is a thought. </p> id:1283618,created:2020-01-22 12:51:26 -0800,updated:2020-01-23 07:33:21 -0800,creator:dmcmillen,updated_by:dmcmillen,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Ok.

I have had an ff account for a long time and used sync; been a ff user since the beginning.  About a year and a half ago, I had to switch to Chrome because of an ff runaway memory problem that I was unable to fix.  I upgraded the desktop from Win 7 to Win 10 last December and early this January I made the switch back to ff by creating a new profile and importing the Chrome data via the ""Import data from another browser"".  I cleaned up the Chrome data and saved to html file for backup.  Each time I tried to get sync working sync would create/add/duplicate bookmarks which led me to this post.  Each time I try sync and it creates this mess, I delete all the bookmarkbackups directory files and delete places.sqlite and import my saved html file, which is where I am now. </p><p>As you can see in my quoted post, I have changed my account password with absolutely no change to the sync behavior, not the expected result given that the password is used to generate the access key.  So, either that assumption is incorrect and the sync data is still there OR it did delete all existing account sync data and the data is coming from somewhere else.  Either way I would really like to solve this problem.  I appreciate everyones help here. </p> id:1282868,created:2020-01-20 08:16:57 -0800,updated:2020-01-20 08:16:57 -0800,creator:dmcmillen,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Well, today there is only ""Web Session, Firefox 72, Current session"" and ""Web Session, Firefox 72, 21 hours ago"" both with the option to disconnect.

En la versión 70.0.1 al iniciar sesión se sincronizaba el historial, marcadores y varios datos más, al salir o cerrar sesión todo, completamente todo se eliminaba, es decir, me dejaba el navegador limpio, como si no lo hubiera usado, eso para mí es muy importante debido a que en otras ocasiones ingresaron a mis redes sociales usando este equipo y con la versión 70.0.1 todo iba muy bien, me sentía seguro. Con la nueva actualización la versión 72.0.1 esto no sucede, se puede cerrar sesión pero me manda un mensaje que dice: “Firefox se desconectará de tu cuenta, pero no eliminará los datos de navegación en este dispositivo”. Esto para mi representa una gran desventaja, ya que prefiero seguir manteniendo mi privacidad sobre que sitios visito, las contraseñas que introduzco y hasta los sitios que tengo guardado en “marcadores”, en mi trabajo ya me abrieron mi equipo físicamente varias veces y buscan mucha información en los navegadores. Mi pregunta es: ¿hay alguna forma de cerrar la sesión de Firefox Sync y al cerrar que borre historial y marcadores además de otros datos? Que lo deje limpio como si fuera la instalación original.  </p><p>Gracias por su ayuda. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,bookmarks,es,1281832;1281999;1282440;1323540;,gabzavram,"id:1323540,created:2020-06-13 04:26:35 -0800,updated:2020-06-13 04:26:35 -0800,creator:armandoreyesreyes901,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>“Firefox se desconectará de tu cuenta, pero no eliminará los datos de navegación en este dispositiv </p> id:1282440,created:2020-01-18 17:33:44 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 17:33:44 -0800,creator:pcp04,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Gracias por compartir!, solo necesitaríamos que coloques esta consulta como solucionada y indicando la respuesta elegida como solución. ¡Gracias! </p> id:1281999,created:2020-01-17 08:37:16 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 08:37:16 -0800,creator:gabzavram,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>si funcionó, muchas gracias por la ayuda. </p><p>Saludos. </p> id:1281832,created:2020-01-16 17:01:23 -0800,updated:2020-01-16 17:01:23 -0800,creator:pcp04,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hola,  Entiendo que hubo problemas con esta funcionalidad: desde usuarios que borraban sus datos sin querer, usuarios que pensaban que borraba los datos del Servidor de Sync a usuarios a los que no se le borraba los datos.

I bet that it was something like that causing the browser to switch, as in the browser cache for <a href=""http://route66mc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com</a> was remembering the redirect to https://www.route66mc. and I looked for browser cache only in https://route66mc </p> id:1303177,created:2020-04-06 17:10:07 -0800,updated:2020-04-06 17:10:07 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi firefox195, if I try the URL you seem to be referring to in the original screenshot -- </p><p><a href=""http://route66mc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com/</a> </p><p>-- the server immediately sends a  </p><p><code>301 Moved Permanently</code> </p><p>response code with </p><p><code>Location: <a href=""https://route66mc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://route66mc.com/</a></code> </p><p>as the new URL Firefox should load instead. </p><p>So the http =&gt; https redirect is coming from the web server.

It is a twisty trail, but my conclusion after several hours of digging was that SPDY is a fully-deprecated predecessor to HTTP2. All the major browsers, I believe including Firefox, have now dropped support of SPDY in favor of HTTP2. I believe the appearance of ""spdy"" in the Firefox about:config network preferences is legacy from when SPDY was available but HTTP2 was not yet stable/deployed. So all those preferences that used to relate to SPDY now relate to HTTP2, but the legacy terminology (confusingly) remains ... </p> </blockquote> <p>@Beady - Thank you for taking the time to elaborate. </p>"

Launching an executable from the downloads list may modify the privileges of the launched program, which could affect the parts of disk where it is allowed to open files from. For example, Firefox normally runs with reduced privileges when UAC is set normally, so when you launch a PDF into Adobe Reader from the downloads list, Adobe Reader inherits those reduced privileges. If UAC is not set to its default setting or various programs are run as administrator, there may be a mismatch of privileges.

It now looks effectively identical to how it used to before, if slightly a bit grainier on netflix but I can live with that.

This was very random that it should happen a few days after I updated the drivers rather than the day of.

I switched to Surface Go and viola, page appeared as it should. </p><p>Now the question is why I had to do this and what are the ramifications of my using my Custom Device with deficient Agent String? </p><p>Also, does this mean Firefox was reporting device specs incorrectly or is NYT getting specs incorrectly?

The problem is this; when I reopen firefox after either  A) having shut down my laptop, or  B) having simply 'quit' firefox,  I must enter my email address and password again, then enter my phone number so that it can send me a text to the link to the firefox app for my phone (which I have installed), then finally I can navigate firefox as normal and my websites and history are remembered. However, it is not really ""as normal"" because I have to SIGN INTO the websites again. Sometimes it remembers the username and password and all I have to do is click through it, but sometimes it doesn't and I have to manually sign into them. Bookmarks aren't ever saved either. I have attached the screenshot of the screen that comes up every time I reopen firefox and this problem happens. I did not have this problem on my older firefox instillation, just when I updated to the newest version. It is so irritating.

I run these relevant tests immediately upon bringing up a new incidence of Firefox since that is when the huge accumulations have been sabotaging the operability of everything else on my computer.  The point is that until the garbled v72.0.1, I could always rely on Firefox to zero out the entire cache.  I should not now be compelled, after years of proper operation of the program, to go through three wrist painful clicks to get the thing to finally get around to clearing its accumulated GARBAGE.  Your reference to a ""doomed"" folder has no equivalent on my Windows 7 computer.  It isn't that I'm short on disk space, it is that v72.0.1 of Firefox is accumulating SO MUCH GARBAGE and refusing to clear it that the cache is interfering with even bringing up other programs.  Your assertion that a full GIGABYTE of GARBAGE or large MEGABYTES of such ""are not going to interfere with the operation of other programs"" is contradicted by my real world experience which has repeatedly shown that Firefox's recently inflicted refusal to clear cache is in fact sabotaging my entire computer, even requiring a warm reboot to get anything else to run.  Incidentally I have tried several of the self styled ""clear cache"" addons or extensions and absolutely none of them comes anywhere close to clearing the garbage collection.  Only the five painful clicks using my long since crippled wrists to get to and via the Options/Privacy and Security area has been able to get rid of the garbage which Firefox insists on accumulating and RECENTLY BEGAN REFUSING TO CLEAR. </p> id:1282134,created:2020-01-17 15:59:27 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 15:59:27 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Ha, i usually use about:blank myself.

How are you determining the size of the cache remained after clearing?  You don't have to wait for cache to clear at shutdown, you can clear it any time. Make sure you have no other web pages open other than your Preferences page, or a blank page when clearing cache, as an open page cannot be cleared.  </p><p>There are multiple ways to access the Clear History. You seem to favor opening Preferences → Privacy and Security.  Once you click on Clear History, you have choices. Make sure at least that Cache is checked, and the Time Range to Clear is set to Everything. Click Clear Now.   </p><p>At no time do i get a size report of anything. Checking folders under /Cache2 gives me an empty /entries folder and about 2.2MB in /doomed folder. </p><p>If your excessive cache storage is in the /doomed folder, yes this could be a problem. This is supposed to be for open/active pages, including the Firefox Home or any home page. These are set to be deleted, but <em>when</em> is not specified - apparently not very soon at all in some cases. (This is even listed as a bug, as it should be.) This, however, has been the behavior for years, so i do not know if it addresses your issue. You can manually delete these if Firefox is closed, if it helps. </p><p>If you type about:cache in the address bar and Enter, in the Disk section you can see the location of your cache2 folder, and also list any cache entries. </p><p>A last thought: Unless you are radically short on disk space, application temporary caches are not going to interfere with the operation of other programs.  This doesn't excuse Firefox if it is misbehaving, but it does point to an issue that a change to Firefox will not fix. </p> id:1281249,created:2020-01-15 07:50:42 -0800,updated:2020-01-15 07:50:42 -0800,creator:bobgru,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>@crankygoat Your suggestion to check the Task Manager/Processes was a good one so I brought up the Task Manager (always set to Processes anyway since that's the only relevant aspect) then brought up Firefox.  There were four processes shown as ""firefox.exe"" in the list while Firefox was running.  They all disappeared instantly when I exited Firefox so our (yes I was wondering about that too) suspicion about belated exit wasn't borne out.  As for the notion of ""already been fetched from the web"", unless Firefox has been redefined in such a way as to go out on its own (my home page is ""about:blank"") to gather trash from the wubb, the notion of having ""already"" gathered garbage doesn't hold.  The baseline 26.0 Kb appears to be only Firefox's *own* use of cache.  It's the MEGABYTES of *carryover* garbage, reaching a full GIGABYTE at one time early in this inquiry process, that are my concern.  It's quite clear that the cache is *not* being overwritten and that the sabotaging of bringing up any other program after Firefox *leaves* it excessively large is THE PROBLEM.  I looked into my installation records and unfortunately didn't record the v72.0.1 ""upgrade"".  Last one I did record was v71.0 in the week ending 191206.  So my bottom line remains that a DEFECT WAS INTRODUCED during the ""upgrade"" to v72.0.1 which defeats the years and years of proper operation clearing cache upon exit. </p> id:1281102,created:2020-01-14 20:30:46 -0800,updated:2020-01-14 20:30:46 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Controlling P-i-P: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox</a> </p> <blockquote> When I exit Firefox and twiddle my thumbs for awhile, then fire it up again to check Options\Privacy &amp; Security, I'm still finding as much as MEGABYTES of garbage that haven't been cleared from my cache. </blockquote> <p>You might check in Task Manager, Processes tab, to ensure all the Firefox processes have terminated.

After all the alterations I've made in the ""apparent"" controls, it seems to me that an inherent defect has been introduced into Firefox during the various recent ""updates"".  Fact is until a couple of weeks ago, I never had any of these problems.  The only problem that has been cleared away is the obnoxious, never authorized by me to be installed at all on my computer, ""picture in a picture"" function which was inflicting its disruptions on every video that I attempted to stream until I accidentally ran across it and shut it off during my scramblings to try to resolve this apparent new defect in the way that Firefox operates.  That was no ""improvement"" but a major imposition on Firefox afficianados such as myself.

Removed those as part of checking out your suggestions.

Firefox has been acting strange lately. Opened up the package contents of the app (on macbook pro 2012) and saw a chrome manifest folder that seemed to be blocking web access on certain sites. Using a similar computer (with ff installed) and decided to look in the app folder. I saw a blocklist.xml sheet. Wondering if this is something that should be in there by default? Some of the things on the list, are things that i'd more likely need than not need. Here is a list of blocked sites and ip addresses. Any help is greatly appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks,  </p><p> &lt;blocklist xmlns=""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/2006/addons-blocklist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/2006/addons-blocklist</a>"" lastupdate=""1578526685310""&gt;

Ah-HA!, he said. THEN.. you can EXPORT all or some (selected) bookmarks to  an HTML file. zowie! 'folderized' bookmarks are labeled with the foldername preceding; the HTML is a linear sequential report (haven't tried SORT or SELECT options to see if they modify the export). </p><p>But you might want to check out <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/faview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">www.nirsoft.net/utils/faview.html</a>. here's the skinny from the website: </p><p><em> FavoritesView displays the list of all your Favorties (of Internet Explorer browser) and bookmarks (of Netscape/Mozilla browsers) in a single page. Each line in the list specifies the title of the item, the URL address, the created/modified date of the bookmark item, and the folder name. You select one or more of these bookmarks, and then copy them to the clipboard, delete them (Only for Internet Explorer Favorites), export them to tab-delimited text file, HTML file, or XML file. FavoritesView also allows you to locate duplicate URL addresses in your Favorites/Bookmarks or find specific item by specifying the URL or the title. </em> </p><p>...which is a bit more useful than vanilla HTML, IMNSHO. </p><p>BTW, there's BUKU utilities on NIRSOFT, it's a treasure trove; some of them can really get you out of WTF?! jams.

I've been using Firefox and Thunderbird since the end of the old Seamonkey days.

If I switch to satellite view, the roads are there, but not when switching back to Map view.  All the minor roadlines disappear.  Recently I noticed a similar fault on another website, where faint lines indicating button places also disappeared or are very faint. Has Firefox changed how it renders lines/ colours?  If so, can I find a way to tell the system to show these features? </p><p>Alternatively, is the fault with how Google outputs its data? </p><p>Attached are 2 versions of a map, one in normal view (no roads) and one in enquiry mode (lots of roads visible as gaps in the data) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1280232;1280288;1280377;1280645;1281097;,cvhorie,"id:1281097,created:2020-01-14 20:05:34 -0800,updated:2020-01-14 20:07:12 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:ComputerWhiz,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I've attached a screenshot from my system of the same location <strike>at roughly the same scale</strike> (I guess I'm a little more zoomed in on the map, but it should still work) as the image that you included in your post.

The GUI simply stales as nothing happened.  To reproduce: 1. Configure FF with an HTTP proxy (squid) in deny by default. 2. Open duckduckgo, search something, and click on any https link that has not been whitelisted in the proxy. 3. After the click, nothing happens -&gt; no error, no information message, nothing. (in the dev tools -&gt; network tab, one can see a 403 status.) </p><p>This also happens when browsing websites: if the website includes a link to another website that is not whitelisted, nothing happens, the user is not informed that the host could not be reached. </p><p>This seems like a mechanism has been broken, as FF always used to inform the user of the host not responding with an error page. </p><p>Thanks for reading, sb3k </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;firefox-720;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1280116;1280269;,mozilla.org8,"id:1280269,created:2020-01-11 21:56:51 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 21:56:51 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>What if you try some return codes here: <a href=""https://httpstat.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://httpstat.us/</a> You can append your desired status code to the URL or pick from a list on the default landing page. </p><p>I get a very small, e.g., 403 Forbidden in the upper left.

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall. </p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen. </p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout. </p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly. </p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second. </p><p>Reproduce: - client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a> - client.html: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ</a> </p><p>1) Put client.js and client.html into a directory and open client.html in Firefox 72. 2) (optional) Do the same but with Chromium. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-720;,firefox,other,en-US,"",anole3623,""

When OneTouch is activated, the text 'Securely logging you in...' appears overlayed with the spinning wheel in the popup window. This continues indefinitely.  When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next.  It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour.   Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors.  In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute ‘postMessage’ on ‘DOMWindow’: The target origin provided (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’) does not match the recipient window’s origin (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’).' error.

Their web site is <a href=""http://www.robosizer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.robosizer.com</a>. </p><p>Robosizer is a desktop based programme that can very quickly downsize photos from Mb to Kb for attaching to emails where there is an overall limit to the size of any particular email. Of course I have no idea why this has started to happen as Firefox used to open with Robosizer enabled. </p><p>However, back in September after replacing my PC, I did report to Bitdefender, my Security programme, that "" 'Advanced Threat Defense' had started blocking installhook.exe, part of the programme Robosizer, multiple times and I can't seem to stop it. I've used Robosizer many times on my previous desktop pc without any problem and do not believe it to be a threat."" </p><p>However, a few days later, Bitdefender replied to me ""We have received an answer from our Virus Analysis Labs. The file is clean and detection should be removed in the next couple of updates."" </p><p>So, I don't know what to make of this. Needless to say for the time being I have left Robosizer start up disabled. </p> id:1280079,created:2020-01-11 05:49:37 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 05:49:37 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Make sure to post any new crash reports. </p><p><br> Start your <strong>Computer</strong> in safe mode with network support.

Try starting Firefox with Add Ons Disabled (from your Help menu). </li><li> You have some other code in userChrome.css that interferes with the ""Tabs on Bottom"" code in Private Browsing mode.  Try starting with only ""Tabs on Bottom"" code in userChrome.css and add back other code until it breaks, again. </li><li> You are starting a different profile for Private Browsing.  If you have somehow rigged this up, you just need to find its userChrome.css file.  It is highly unlikely that you are doing this without realising it, though. </li></ul> <p>Overall, here is how I would troubleshoot your installation: </p> <ol><li> Ensure that you are working on the correct userChrome.css file by checking your active profile at ""about:profiles"" -- on Windows, it is the profile in the ""Roaming"" directory that you need to change, if there is a ""Root"" (the ""Roaming"" directory) and a ""Local"" (the ""Local"" directory) listed. </li><li> Rename userChrome.css to userChrome.css.bak. </li><li> Restart Firefox in order to verify that the tabs are on top and work as expected in normal and Private Browsing modes. </li><li> Create userChrome.css with <em>only</em> the ""Tabs on Bottom"" code in it. </li><li> Restart Firefox in order to verify that the tabs are on the bottom and work as expected in normal and Private Browsing modes. </li><li> Add back any other code that you want in your userChrome.css file and repeat from step five until you are happy with the results. </li></ol> <p>If there is any difference between the normal and Private Browsing modes in step three or in step five, restart Firefox with Add Ons disabled (from the Help menu) to see if that makes a difference. </p><p>I hope that these suggestions are helpful.

The best fix I was able to find to restore drag and drop proper functionality is to go into ""about:config"" page, find ""browser.launcherProcess.enabled"" setting and switch it to ""false"". The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).

Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc. </p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section. </p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites. Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks. This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find. It may also be a government imposed function. Either one. </p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ? </p><p>WTF ?

Then they removed that setting, citing the upcoming deprecation of Flash as justification ... even though that isn't going to happen until the beginning of 2021. Because every website that uses Flash is on their own internal timetable to replace it with whatever is appropriate in HTML5, this means every time I access a site that hasn't upgraded yet, I have to authorize Firefox to run Flash via the pull-down from the address bar.  EVERY SINGLE TIME. </p><p>It happens that there are four sites I visit daily, in order to play Hidato, Sudoku, Jumble, and the like.  I have been visiting those sites for literally years.  They pose no security threat, yet they are probably going to be staying in Flash until almost the last minute, because those online puzzles are going to be difficult to replicate in HTML5.  I have asked -- multiple times -- for a relatively simple fix, which is to modify the pull-down to allow Firefox to ""remember"" my decision to allow <strong>only for that site</strong>. </p><p>All I get in return is ""we did this because Flash is going away"" ... well, yes, I have acknowledged that every time.  But they acted more than a year before that was going to be an issue, they have inconvenienced every user who has a circumstance like mine, and now we are at FF72 and guess what still hasn't been addressed by them. </p><p>I'm going to keep complaining about this until either they put in a temporary fix (which, of course, would be removed along with Flash support itself a year from now) or time runs out.  I figure that if they can't be responsive, they deserve to be called out on it as often as they put out a release that doesn't address this simple, basic problem <strong>which they created and now apparently refuse to fix</strong>. </p><p>Corrupt?

I'll click on a page to load it, then the black 'finding' dot on the tab will bobble about a bit, then it turns to the blue 'connecting' dot and keeps loading for minutes. At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up '<a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a>' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following: </p><p>Looking up <a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://fonts.googleapis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">fonts.googleapis.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com</a> Read <a href=""http://s.salecycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">s.salecycle.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com</a> Looking up (numbers and letters).cloudfront.net Looking up <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> TLS handshake with <a href=""http://i.salecycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">i.salecycle.com</a> Sending <a href=""http://i.salecycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">i.salecycle.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> Waiting for <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> </p><p>I don't have this problem with anything else connected to the network - I tested the WiFi connection just now on my Xbox and got 35.73, 34.31 and 35.94mb/s, but trying to load <a href=""http://broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk</a> on Firefox took 16m 13s just to load the page, and it's not even got near to starting the test.

If it's too far off this topic, I can repost it as a separate question. </p><p>For some time, my Firefox profile has had a userChrome.css file containing tabs on the bottom code, which worked.  I don't know what other code was in the file.  However, after a while, as Firefox updated before version 71, Firefox's tabs began to crash unpredictably and with increasing frequency when connected to the web.  Nearly every time, after a few tab crashes, other programs open on my Windows 10 computer would freeze and/or I would get a black screen or both.  Restarting Firefox and/or the computer did not help for long.  Creating a new profile and copying the bookmarks and other existing personalized data files to the new profile also did not help. </p><p>After I installed version 71, I made the needed changes in userChrome.css to keep tabs on the bottom working, and the crashes stopped.  When 72 arrived, tabs on the bottom stopped.  I was unable to get them working again until after 72.01 installed and I installed tabs on the bottom code only.  However, the freeze, etc. problems have started again.  Are a file or files in my Firefox profile the culprit(s)? </p> id:1280022,created:2020-01-11 00:28:00 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 00:28:00 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It looks that it is possible to modify the current code and replace :root with *|*:root through out the tabs on bottom CSS code. </p> id:1279911,created:2020-01-10 12:40:47 -0800,updated:2020-01-10 12:40:47 -0800,creator:phumphries,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I am glad to have been of help, and, of course, the code is a compilation of many contributors' work. </p> id:1279910,created:2020-01-10 12:33:45 -0800,updated:2020-01-10 12:33:45 -0800,creator:MauriceFLesses,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Peter, your code worked.

This can sometimes save a lot of space. </p><p>There are also some good cleanup utilities, like <a href=""https://www.ccleaner.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CCleaner</a>], that can usually clean a lot of data out for you.

Fix might also involve clearing some telstra-related cookies, because I did that too, but that seems less likely. </p><p>Summary: turns out that Telstra's routers have some ""captive portal"" functionality that they use surreptitiously as a ""malware prevention"" mechanism.  They can (and do, apparently) dynamically black-hole some IP addresses, or perhaps DNS lookups.  Looks as though stale information in that list managed to collide with Firefox's local detectportal Akamai service.  Telstra's on-line chat and telephone support operators were completely ineffectual in diagnosing this, by the way.  Both gave up.  The second advised strongly <em>against</em> rebooting the router.  Sigh.  I'm fairly sure that if the modem still had its default LAN configuration settings, the mymodem.modem URL would have resolved to it, but it doesn't, and my highest priority DNS is google's IPv6 one, I think, so that doesn't resolve to anything. </p><p>Router restart did ""fix"" the problem though. </p><p>It would be nice if the network.captive-portal-service.enabled frob could be exposed as a settings knob.  This desktop machine isn't going to move to a captive portal at any time, so doesn't need to do the check that triggered the fault.  Wouldn't want to share that with synch services though. </p><p>Thanks for listening! </p>"

I added this question to my watch list because I was looking for some more information for you. </p><p>The <strong>Colors</strong> options in the Firefox settings are global settings, meaning that they will apply to every website. If you are looking to only adjust the background colour for the <code>about:blank</code> page, you will likely have more luck adding a <code>userContent.css</code> file to Firefox. </p><p>The <code>userContent.css</code> file allows you to customize the content that Firefox displays to you, so it can be used to customize the <code>about:blank</code> background colour. </p><p>You will need to use the following code: </p> <pre>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:blank) {     * {         background: black !important;     } }</pre> <p>If you don't already have a <code>userContent.css</code> file in Firefox (which you likely don't), you need to make one. This is done by first creating a <code>chrome</code> folder in your <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox profile folder</a> (if it doesn't already exist). In there is where you create your <code>userChrome.css</code> file, which can be done with a text editor like Windows Notepad. </p><p>Alternatively, I've <a href=""https://send.firefox.com/download/6474a8983f7fb1b6/#Z4yU2BCU4-u90uMOG0fxJQ"" rel=""nofollow"">uploaded a copy of the userContent.css file that you can download</a> and paste into the <code>chrome</code> folder. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The download link is only valid for 7 days. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1279765,created:2020-01-09 18:22:08 -0800,updated:2020-01-09 18:22:08 -0800,creator:acartriana,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>No one would respond, so I finally deleted my FF browser and reinstall it.  </p><p>Pro: My concern over the loss of toolbar sites &amp; bookmarks was wasted energy.

I have researched the support threads here and I feel the start of weird Sync issues which seemed to have began 4 1/2 years ago when the Sync feature was modified during the latter Beta stage of development with the Firefox for iOS app - like in May or June 2015. Only users who have connected a ""mobile device"" seem to have the ""duplication of bookmarks"" fault; in a few cases it was dozens or even over 100 sets of duplicates for users who were slow to catch on that there was a problem.  I am hoping that this ""mobile device"" issue will be solved shortly as Mozilla releases new versions of the Firefox mobile web browser app. </p> <hr> <p>In conclusion, if you try to manually repair the 'carnage' by all means <strong>dis-Connect</strong> from Sync on the laptop/desktop devices before deleting any of the duplicate sets of bookmarks.

As we all do. </p><p>I'm sorry this is probably going to be a long explanation but want all to have the full picture. </p><p>Over the years I would always back up my bookmarks as an html file whenever I reinstalled windows, got a new pc etc. One thing it seems I have missed and may be an issue is over the years I never made a firefox account. Just used the browser. </p><p>Recently like many I'm sure, I updated a windows 7 laptop to windows 10.  </p><p>This one time, I forgot to back up the bookmarks as an html file, just the rest of my files on the pc. This might of been because of all the chaos at the holidays or because I had already learned that the new windows 10 install can save everything from windows 7. </p><p>I installed the windows 10 and selected the option to save all files and programs. When the install finished, there it was, what seemed to be my exact windows 7 laptop, files, and programs just with the windows 10 system now. FANTASTIC! All good! </p><p>Not good. A few days later the laptop would not boot up. It was frozen at the windows 10 logo part of the start up with the spinning and spinning but never opened. </p><p>Searched online for answers, found some, and tried all fixes. The laptop would also not start the auto repair feature. </p><p>At this point I had to take it somewhere. I have an online business and of course it was all in that laptop... and backed up from a few weeks earlier. </p><p>The place I would have taken it was closed for the week. took somewhere else. </p><p>I told them I needed two things only since the pc was backed up a couple weeks back.  </p><p>The files on the desktop and my FIREFOX BOOKMARKS! Easy right? </p><p>They tried I'm sure the same methods I tried to get it to boot. They could not and said they would have to reinstall windows. </p><p>Fine, no problem, they were told clearly what to save and windows 10 can save it anyway during the install. </p><p>These idiots did not use the save all the files and programs option. They backed up files to their computers and wiped the laptop clean! Now what? </p><p>Well we know the installation makes a windows old file and we all know firefox saves bookmark back ups, saves around 15 or so but you'll always have the most recent. </p><p>This is the problem. Firefox didn't seem to saving the bookmarks or updating the backups. </p><p>In my brand new laptop I can see in the backup bookmarks folder that it is backing up everyday or so and in just under a week I already have several days of backup bookmarks in the folder. </p><p>On the old laptop, with the reinstall, the bookmark back up folder in the windows old folder has a list of backup json files but the last json file has a date created of September 2019 and then in the file name it seems to show a date of 12-22-19 which I thought was the bookmarks I needed seeing the December date in the file name. But it's not and they are what seems to be back from September. So why no back up json file for the last three months. I know that seems to be a short amount of time but first, the bookmarks seem to be older than september based on things I was doing at the time and in the last three months I have made major changes in my business and started a new one. EVERYTHING IS MISSING&gt;  </p><p>Hope I can find some help. I read an article about everything possibly being in sqlite file or something. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>Jon </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1278859;1278861;1278995;1279003;1279022;,jdw6942,"id:1279022,created:2020-01-07 06:43:33 -0800,updated:2020-01-07 06:43:33 -0800,creator:jdw6942,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Ok......... </p><p><br> There are many reasons this could have happened. </p><p>There are many things I can do in the future to prevent this. </p><p>Does anyone know how to get them back? </p> id:1279003,created:2020-01-07 05:33:37 -0800,updated:2020-01-07 05:33:37 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There might have been a problem with the places.sqlite database, assuming that you always close Firefox properly via ""File -&gt; Exit/Quit"" and not by clicking the close button. </p> id:1278995,created:2020-01-07 05:10:53 -0800,updated:2020-01-07 05:10:53 -0800,creator:jdw6942,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There were changes almost every day to the bookmarks during that time.

I do understand that but is not really helpful at the moment because the situation has already happened. As stated above I used to always save my bookmark back ups myself any time I had a system change. This was a different situation where I took for the first time, a computer to a repair place and they wiped it clean. </p><p>So the thing  Ireally need to know is if the json file back ups were not backing up for whatever reason, is there any other way to recover the bookmarks?

I am taking advantage since a significant number of years of the HUGE history on Firefox-type (I also use Palemoon) browsers, to use these histories AS STUDY NOTEBOOKS. That is: I _always_ open a normal window, a Library&gt;History window, and a private window (_in this order_) and browse _only_ in (the) private window(s). And move (drag &amp; drop) studied pages carefully chosen URLs (page location tags, etc.) to the normal window (and therefore into the History), with the DATE AND TIME). (I know there is an addon for this but sometimes I know I want to save a whole sequence of page so this suits me better). This _time indexing_ and _chronological display_ of visited pages is an _invaluable_ asset in LEARNING (item linked to those visited before and after, work session span, etc.). I use the tags for notes / page extracts (the limited tag length is great because it forces to be concise). I continuously curate this history and delete LOADS of things that I decide are no longer valuable, but I still have several years worth of notes. So I search and find a page, and its date is more that 6 months in the past. Now (as explained above) I have to navigate to that time to see THE CONTEXT of THAT _learning experience_. But I have so many items in the ""Older than 6 months"" 'folder' that scrolling to the right date _is awfull_ (imprecise, skip over the right date constantly , etc._ : - (  Please tell me there is a setting to display all 12 months in the History navigation pane, or an add-on that does that or the full indexing of the History (full years and months hierarchy).

The other issue is that Firefox tends to be stricter in adhering to standards while some other browsers allow technically inappropriate behaviours, are more forgiving, or have quirks/compatibility mode for obsolete or bad code.  This compounds the problem in identifying the issue and whether it is a FF bug.  I, personally, would not know where to even begin suggesting what sort of info to pull using the Web Developer or other tools, especially running blind. </p><p>Here are some stupid suggestions, from my experience: - Use an email provider other than an ISP. They are frequently bad at webmail and don't care to spend much keeping it up to date, even when they are using a customized third-party email provider.  (Or they may change radically your webmail interface in a way you do not like.) [Most of these ISPs are no strangers to being voted into the top 10 worst companies in America to work for, and in customer service and satisfaction.] - Set up an actual email client (or even a fake email ""app""), instead of, or alongside, using webmail. This can get you past loads of issues, and give you far more control over curating your mail. </p><p>Stupid, i know, but still offering.  These are good alternatives, no matter what browser you use.  And just to be clear, it is hardly that i think Mozilla is perfect and blameless. Hopefully <em>someone</em> can have a look at this with debug eyes. </p> id:1280129,created:2020-01-11 10:06:25 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 10:51:44 -0800,creator:kenspeed,updated_by:kenspeed,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>The shift key trick didn't work.

I'm a developer and burgeoning font nerd, and I'm really into shell configuration for Zsh, which requires some custom fontography. </p><p>These overlapping areas use various fonts that provide glyphs for characters inside the Unicode Private Use Areas. Examples are: </p> <ul><li> All the things aggregated into NerdFonts - <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts</a> </li><li> The Powerline shell-prompt symbols - <a href=""https://github.com/powerline/powerline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/powerline/powerline</a> </li><li> Klingon - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html</a> </li><li> Anything else in the ConScript Registry - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/</a> </li></ul> <p>So, I'd like to set up my browser to be able to display a few, or all of these things. For example, in the discussion going on at the GitHub issue <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409</a>. </p><p>But I don't see any way in Firefox to set up a chain of ""fallback fonts"" or something like that. In Preferences &gt; Language and Appearance &gt; Fonts and Colors &gt; Advanced, it gives me a selection for ""Fonts for:"", which allows me to assign fonts on a per-script basis. But: </p><p>a) assigning a single font for ""Other Writing Systems"" (assuming that encompasses the Unicode PUA areas) is not sufficient, and b) uh-oh, maybe bug!

Then Firefox crashed and restarted in an auto-installed update a couple of weeks ago. Firefox was unusable for me from then on. It looks like the display is shifted down half a screen, so the bottom of the window is drawn at the top and the top of the window is drawn at the bottom. Mouse-interaction still functions as if the display did not shift, so it is challenging to click around. </p><p>I've cleared out everything. Every application settings folder and profile folder I could find, removed Firefox altogether and installed an older version of Firefox. This works right up until an update is installed again. I also made sure I updated OSX to the latest version. The last couple of weeks I've been using Firefox Firefox 61.0b8 without any problems (I disabled auto-updates). But when I installed the latest Firefox version again today, same problem popped up.

Everything works fine except when i come to print the report.  When i click the print button, FF should bring up the windows printer dialogue box to allow me to pick a printer and print the report.  However, it crashes every single time.  Usually the first time it happens the dialogue box will simply open and then quickly close.  If i try to do it again, FF will crash.  I spoke with their support a while back, and while it makes no sense, i enabled POP up blocking and that fixed the problem for a while.  Now FF has been updated a few times and it is back to crashing all the time doing that same task.  I  tried to enable and disable the pop up blocker again to no avail.  It will also not work with private browsing. I know I have a lot of add-ons installed.  I even tried to remove the 2 that i would think would be likely culprits.  NoScript and AdBlockPlus.
