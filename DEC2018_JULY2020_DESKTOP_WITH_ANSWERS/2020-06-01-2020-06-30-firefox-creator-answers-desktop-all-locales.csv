If I move it up some just a little 3/4"" it seems to be a small drop down window again. If I move it up even more not to the max but just up to say about 1/2"" the drop down window gets bigger however it is still cut down with no way to scroll down to see the rest of the window. So what my thoughts are is the over scan of the video is too big? If so how do I take care of it? I hope this helps out. Let me know thank you for your help on this matter. So if I go to single display its all good on the laptop window. </p><p>UPDATE: So I have also played with other web browser, Chrome and Edge and I can't recreate it in those browsers.

Funny how that tempts one to change the default to Edge -- conspiracy?   Is there something I can tweak either in Bluetooth or in FireFox?   Jon I have now confirmed that the problem is with FireFox and not with the bluetooth Bose speakers.  The pause/play and volume buttons on the Bose speakers work with Chrome, Edge and Safari as well as music players from Win10 and an iPad -- but do not work from any of those devices with FireFox.  Is there something I need to do to FireFox on my end, or is it just broken? Jon </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,other,en-US,"",EakesJ

I use Firefox from long long years and I love it so much. The only thing Chrome does better is that while you are using remote debug to debug an app or a mobile website, Chrome shows you a screencast of the connected device and you can interact with the app or the website directly through your mouse: you can select an element hovering and clicking, exactly like you do debugging a desktop website. This is extremely useful and I'd like to get this even in Firefox and I'm wondering why I can't. Can someone explain why and if we can hope this feature will be added in the next future?

At that point, to watch more, I either have to use my phone, close and reopen Firefox, or refresh my browser, which was fine in the beginning, but now it's getting a little frustrating. I've attempted browser refresh, which doesn't remove the problem, and the site works fine without fail on Chrome and Edge, but I don't like either of those browsers since switching to Firefox 6 months ago.  Ultimately I'm bringing it up because no one else has. If there's a way to fix it that I haven't found yet, I'd love to hear it. Otherwise, it's still worth bringing up so it can be fixed.

At first, I had it happen in every browser and in the private mode, but after a day of that, it is now only happening in firefox anymore.  </p><p>Explanation, in case it's unclear what I'm talking about: On every blog on tumblr that you open (<a href=""http://URL.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">URL.tumblr.com</a>, for example <a href=""https://staff.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://staff.tumblr.com</a> is the link to the blog of the tumblr-staff if you'd prefer an actual blog to look at), in the top right corner of the page, there should be a few buttons, depending on if it's your blog or if you're logged in or not varying between 'follow' and 'join tumblr', 'edit post', 'edit appearance', 'reblog' or 'like', things like that. </p> <ul><li> I'm not sure if that part helps with solving the issue, so just in case: From what I can tell, the controls use codes of iframe to work. </li><li> It is not specific to one blog on tumblr, the controls are gone on every blog/page I open.  </li><li> I opened the pages in private mode and the controls are there. When I go to add-ons and disable everything, the controls still are not showing up though, so I don't think any add-on can be the cause. </li><li> It did work until a few days ago, and I didn't change any settings in my browser during the time. </li><li> I'm using the newest version of firefox (77.0.1), or at least I'm not getting shown any updates left to do in the 'about firefox'. </li></ul> <p>All that I can still think of to do is to try to refresh, or if that doesn't work completely un- and reinstall firefox, or maybe try an older version of ff if that still doesn't help, and I would really rather find a solution without taking such big measures, which is why I am asking here. </p><p>Is there maybe something else that private mode does that I could try to do to fix this? </p><p>Thank you in advance for the answers I might get! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",sweetypeachy

This issue can’t be caused by Google alone, because every Gmail account works perfectly on my roommate’s computer, on my smart phone and on my computer if I use Internet Explorer (which I haven't used for years). Yahoo mail, does interestingly, as will all other non-Gmail accounts, work flawlessly with Firefox. Perhaps the flaw is solely with Firefox when it handshakes with gmail's security protocol, because error code #2005  is what always pops up. Another error message says that Hangouts has not been signed in. And while I do have 2 phone numbers for two Gmail accounts, Gmail also signs me out of 4 other accounts that have no phone numbers.  </p><p>Here's the list of troubleshooting steps attempted recently. If at all possible, I'd like to avoid resetting Firefox, unless I can see from your provision of the entire list of settings, what will be lost. Thank you, for your expert advice. </p><p>1.

I rarely use Tabs. Until recently I've always closed Firefox (along with all pages open) by right clicking on Firefox pages Icon in Taskbar and choosing ""Close All Windows"". This always did the trick every time until recently. Now when I do this it closes about half the pages and I have to keep repeating it until they are all gone. Closing windows one by one or hitting File, Close works too but I rarely do it that way. Chrome and Palemoon close windows fine as they always did but now for some reason Firefox is different.

One of them is located on Desktop A, and the second is on Desktop B. </p><p>When I click a link in an external program -- for example, Outlook, or Excel -- it shell executes that link.  Firefox is set as my default browser, and so it handles the link.  The problem is that when I click a link while looking at Desktop A, the link gets opened by the Firefox window on Desktop B and switches my view there, which takes me away from what I'm working on and forces me to move that tab back to Desktop A manually. </p><p>Furthermore, this is not consistent behavior.  Sometimes clicking a link will cause Firefox to open a new tab in a window in the same desktop I was looking at when I clicked it.  Other times it switches to the other desktop.  I have not been able to figure out what determines which Firefox window gets the link. </p><p>All I really want is for links to open in the Firefox window that's already open in the same desktop as where I clicked the link.  Is there some way to make that happen?  I'm not sure if this a problem with Firefox or with how Windows handles shell-executing links.

It wouldn't even open. Consequently, I had to clean the remainder out and reinstall FF and set it up again to my liking. Since then, Email Link is not working properly. In fact it runs wild and is difficult to stop. In the Options&gt;&gt;Application I have mailto set to Use Microsoft Outlook just as it was before the reinstall which worked correctly.  Now what happens is it gets itself into a never-ending reiteration or opening a new tab in FF, which then does something to open a new iteration of Outlook with the legend Navigation to the webpage was cancelled as shown in the attached screenshot. This somehow manages to open another new tab in FF and so on and so forth, until I manage to stop it. Below is the address I was testing with in a separate FF instance, and was a link to Google which is normally my default New Tab page (don't judge!) mailto:?body=https%3a%2f%<a href=""http://2fwww.google.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">2fwww.google.co.nz</a>%2f&amp;subject=google I don't recognise much of the items on the menu bar, and if I click on the drop down menu  where the above address appears, all it comes up with is Add or Remove buttons.

The problem is that not only don't we use it, but almost no US online forms are designed to accept it.  Virtually every form on any website in the US is set up to expect a TEN DIGIT phone number without any area code.  This is especially true of forms for businesses that only do business with customers in the US. </p><p>I have rarely found any online form in the US that <em>needs</em> the country code -- exactly the contrary I have found numerous online forms that fail when Firefox attempts to enter a phone number with the +1 area code.  Some forms reject the + as a non-numeric character.  Other forms reject the entire phone number entry for having too many characters.  Probably most common are forms that take the numbers as being a standard 10-digit phone number which the form truncates at just 10 digits (cutting off the last one or two digits that Firefox sends).   </p><p>The <strong>fact</strong> that most online forms in the US cannot process a phone number with any country code seems strange considering how many of our web coders are international workers on H2-B visas - but it is absolutely true that most of our online forms <em>cannot</em> process a phone number of more than 10 digits. </p><p>I always enter the phone number as just the 10 digits, but Firefox insists on adding the +1, even when I edit the saved address to remove the +1 Firefox will soon add it again. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,other,en-US,"",n4aof

I could possibly live with that F12 web console behaviour, since it doesnt really do anything but annoy me, i just close it again when i accidentally open it, but that damned F9 is seriously making me hysterical.. ..Just to clarify, if i press the F9 while typing a forum reply, the whole page gets reloaded in some autistic fashion that deletes everything ive typed.. </p><p><br> And to further specify my request; i want ALL the F-buttons to be blocked/unusable by Firefox, but unaffected while in windows or other apps. </p><p>If its not possible to block firefox from receiving the F-key-presses, is it possible to get the source for firefox and rebuild it without those features? ..I would rather just flip a settings switch to disable this F-key madness, but if i were to find a web browser that DIDNT use them, i would have uninstalled firefox for that reason alone.. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1326152;1326188;,junk6

I never really cared about it, but now I want to know. Why is the browser using so much memory? I can't understand how a single tab of, let's say, Youtube on low-quality, generally 360p, is using more than 2 GB of my Systems RAM. I looked up a setting that changes the browser to 1 process, and it helps if I do not have a lot of tabs open. But enabling the setting does nothing. I still have around 6 to 8 processes in my task manager and their total memory usage simply doesn't justify it. If I play a more or less a few-years-old game, I get less memory usage from it than from one tab with a video on it. Heck, actual movies in my video player take much less memory.  Can someone explain to me how this is happening and how I can circumvent the 6-8 processes, which pop-up despite me changing it to 1 process in the settings? Excuse my German screenshot, but it should be understandable that I set it to 1 content process. Also it shows how my browser uses 1 entire Gigabyte of RAM just for this website.

In short, after having Firefox open for a while, it seems to start having issues.  One is that it won't let me add any new bookmarks.  Another one is it won't let me delete current bookmarks.  If I close out Firefox, it always gives me the ""Firefox is not responding"" error message.  So, I have to click on the close option, reopen Firefox, then it works again.  But in that process, I lose all my open tabs, logins, etc.  Quite annoying.  </p><p>I am wondering, is this an ongoing issue with Firefox, or could it be something on my end?

It gave a detailed explanation of how to make the tab text bold. I followed the instructions carefully, but it did not work. Maybe this method doesn't work in the current version of Firefox (77.0.1 as of this writing)? The solution involved adding to or creating a userChrome.css file, which I did (the answer also referenced the filename ""userContent.css"", which I also tried without success). </p><p>The solution said to create a css file that contained this text: </p> <pre>#TabsToolbar .tabbrowser-tab .tab-content {   font-weight: 800 !important; } </pre> <p>put it in a folder named ""chrome"" in the user profile folder, and then restart Firefox, which I did, but it had no effect. </p><p>Anyone have another solution, perhaps that works with a later version of Firefox?

Sometimes it applies to the many menu areas that drop down from the top of the menu (areas). I have a problem where I cant see my screen well or I have to look at my screen from across the room, while laying down on one side or the other because of my pain. Mostly I use my computer while laying down (but that is dictated by my situation at the time if my body will allow it at this exact time), and then other times I can from a normal seated position. The problem is when I go lay down to see whats on the scree I have to change my Windows 10 Settings and choose the Display option 'change size of text, apps, and other' or Ease of Access option 'make everything bigger' to increase the screen size from 100% to 125% or larger. But, when I do the menu options are Not Always, accessible meaning sometimes they scale just fine. But, when I try to access bookmarks, history, or other parts of the menu most of the time it does not let me access your options show all bookmarks, show all history, ect... that should show up at the bottom of the list. Many of the issues of not being able to choose the option I want seems to come from the option of a scroll bar not being incorporated or firefox cant tell what settings my windows is displaying at. Can someone tell me what to do about this? I should be able to figure this out and use my computer without aggravating my medical conditions.

I informed the Firefox person who contacted me that a solution had been found, and he asked me to post that solution here, since I was not the only one posting such a question yesterday.  If your app icons disappear from your browser toolbar, then the solution is to create a new profile for your Firefox account, because the old one has apparently been corrupted.  As soon as I created that new profile, all my previous app icons immediately appeared on the browser toolbar, with no further actions required by me.  I hope this information will help some of you.

That's it. Nowhere in all of the encouragement or top-level descriptions will a user see this. In fact, I don't know WHERE a user could even find this information except through a chance encounter with user comments in support forums, where I eventually found out. </p><p>I AM GENUINELY HIGHLY OFFENDED AT THIS **WILLFULLY** ARROGANT CONCEIT SHOWN BY MOZILLA. </p><p>The descriptions found on <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> are considered by users to be authoritative. Users will invest in these pages a reasonable degree of trust, as Mozilla is supposed to exist for the benefit of the user base, not some selfish staff or support members trying to hide weaknesses and flaws. Some users have even given their own hard-earned money to Mozilla, so they expect at least of modicum of human decency when it comes to Mozilla not deceiving them through lies or blatant omission of facts. The latter, in fact, is a big (and hidden) problem for users trying Sync who don't expect expiration to occur. </p><p>Shame on you. Period. I am surely not the first person to point this out.

Anyhow, I digress. </p><p>I like Firefox. I like the fact that I can keep all of my passwords safe behind one master password. I like the customization features that Firefox can showcase. I'm not particularly thrilled with 10 different versions of what's supposed to be, as it seems, just one product - from Firefox to Firefox Developer Edition, to Firefox Nightly, Firefox Focus, Firefox Entreprise, but I can understand why they seem to coexist together as one whole. I like the mission that the team of Firefox aligns itself with and I'd love to be able to contribute to it. And for me, contribution to anything starts with becoming a fan myself. </p><p>Unfortunately, I've got a couple of things that keep tripping me up. I'm using Windows 10. I've got Firefox installed. I've configured it to my liking. And yet I keep going back to Brave, after every single attempt to remain on Firefox only. </p><p>There are 3 reasons why. </p><p>1) WTF is wrong with the fonts? </p><p>I've configured Brave and Firefox to have the exact same font preferences. </p><p>Same fonts. Same size. Same settings.  </p><p>Same website, for the sake of an example: </p><p><a href=""https://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/computers/browsers/fonttest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/computers/browsers/fonttest.html</a> </p><p>Brave paints fonts normally. I don't know why, but it does. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/RSJuzcU.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/RSJuzcU.png</a> </p><p>Firefox displays the exact same text. But bolder. Jaggier. And uglier. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/xRIr1n1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/xRIr1n1.png</a> </p><p>Showing them separetely won't help much, so here's a side-by-side comparison. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/zxQjWE1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/zxQjWE1.png</a> </p><p>If it looks the same to you, try to open the images in a new tab and looking at them at full, 100% resolution. </p><p>What is true for this site is true for any other application. What looks quite pretty and smooth in Brave looks bolder, heavier, ""in your face"", rugged, ugly, jaggy in Firefox - and I have no clue what to do about it. I've tried playing with about:config for days and days - nothing changes, no matter which font_rendering mode I pick. I've tried to play with extensions - they have no effect. I've tried to disable hardware acceleration. It does nothing. Fonts in Firefox keep looking like something, made for displays of 2000. Not 2020. If there's anything you can recommend me here - I'd be very grateful. </p><p>P.S. Tried and tested on both Firefox and Firefox Developer Edition. Nothing changes. </p><p>2) WTH is wrong with RAM consumption? </p><p>I remember reading somewhere a whole lot of articles, claiming that Chrome (and Chromium based browsers, therefore?) loves to keep as much RAM to itself as possible. While Firefox, on the other hand, is much lighter on resources. As much as I'd like to believe it to be true, my observations tell me the exact opposite. </p><p>Here's a screenshot from the Task Manager of Brave and Firefox with the same tabs and websites opened. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/omhswRZ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/omhswRZ.png</a> </p><p>Compared to Brave, Firefox consistently holds 2 to 5 times as much RAM. Furthermore, it's much more active in terms of CPU load as well, making the task manager claim that the electricity consumption is much higher for Firefox than it is for Brave. </p><p>I'd love to know why. </p><p>But I'd love even more for Firefox to simply be (a lot) less greedy when it comes to resources. </p><p>The fact that the extension library for Firefox is already much more reduced, compared to what's available for Chromium based platforms, I see very little sense in using Firefox if, in addition to making the websites I've gotten used to - uglier, it requires more RAM and CPU power in order to do so. There's just no point. </p><p>3) What's the deal with the freezing every X scrolls? </p><p>I don't like making these comparisons. I don't want to make these comparisons. I'd love to be able to say with confidence ""Firefox rules! Everything else can be dumped.""  </p><p>Instead, however, I'm typing this text, to say that every 5 or 10 ""smooth"" scrolls on Firefox inevitably produce a not-so-critical, but oh-so-much-annoying lag, where the page that's supposed to scroll smoothly momentarily freezes and then jumps in one go to the next place, totally ruining what's supposed to be a completely ""smooth"" scrolling ""experience"".  </p><p>I've tried disabling hardware acceleration here as well. Does nothing. Tried to play with setting. Doesn't help. </p><p>I tried to disable the smooth scrolling feature altogether. In addition to make the browsing experience more unpleasant, it becomes even more painful, as the scrolls that are supposed to be regular and continuous, moving the page up or down in regular intervals of time, happen to suddenly freeze once again and they try to ""recover"" the lost ground by ""pushing"" the page forcefully in the direction of the scroll. This is just painful. Brave doesn't have these issues. Chrome doesn't have these issues. Vivaldi is perfectly smooth. What's the deal with scrolling on Firefox? </p><p>- </p><p>If anyone can guide me here to solve all of the issues I've just described - once and for all, I'll be genuinely grateful. I've tried to find solutions to these problems over and over. And either I didn't find any answer that could help solve these problems even slightly, or I found somewhat amusing, to me, answers directly in the Firefox's wiki - asking, for instance, to simply ""Restart Firefox"" when it becomes too much of a hog for RAM: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=firefox-uses-too-much-memory-ram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=firefox-uses-too-much-memory-ram</a> </p><p>--- QUOTE --- </p><p>Firefox may use more system resources if it's left open for long periods of time. A workaround for this is to periodically restart Firefox. You can configure Firefox to save your tabs and windows so that when you start it again, you can start where you left off. See Restore previous session - Configure when Firefox shows your most recent tabs and windows for details. </p><p>--- END --- </p><p>I am sorry, but what kind of BS is that? It ""may use more system resources""? And it may not? Who's in the charge of this? What makes it impossible to look further into this, and make sure there's no need for any ""workaround""s? Is it impossible to program it once and for all to avoid using more resources, especially when it remains perfectly still? Because I've seen it myself going from 1'200 MB in RAM to 2'400 MB in RAM - WITHOUT ME DOING ANYTHING. AT ALL. Is it impossible to fix? With all the manpower that Mozilla possesses? Is it such a low priority? Or is it just my PC having fun at making Firefox resource greediness go out of hand? </p><p>... </p><p>Pardon me, I had to let this out. I genuinely want to use Firefox. I feel much more emotionally connected to your browser than to any other, guys.  </p><p>But I don't want to experience pain each and every time I use it.  </p><p>The ugly fonts are not pleasant to look at. And they distract me from my work.  </p><p>The RAM consumption makes the whole experience heavier. And it bothers the heck out of me. I don't want to restart Firefox just for ""workarounds"". If I have to restart it, I want it to be for a valid reason. Not because it ""just so happens"" that the browser ""may use more system resources"" (with a dropped ""than necessary"" at the end) - and no one even bothers to fix it.  </p><p>Finally, I don't want to get distracted by lagged scrolling. If I'm browsing the page, I want to be focused on the content. Not on what my browser is doing. And as of now, every time I use Firefox, I'm forced to think of why is the screen not moving up or down the way I expect it to, instead of thinking about what is on this screen. </p><p>If there's anything you can advise me, please do. </p><p>If you feel the need to troubleshoot this further, I'm willing to provide as much data as I can. </p><p>If these issues pertain only to my system, then the bug is on my machine - and I'd be happy to fix as soon as possible before switching full-time to Firefox once and for all. </p><p>Going through the support tickets though, it appears I might not be the only one. And if this is the case, perhaps a more deep investigation into the current Firefox experience, at least pertaining to modern machines, running Windows - might be necessary. </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1325242;1325253;1329406;,bruce.william.collins

At first I couldn't even open Firefox in the native full screen on Mac, so it never opened in a separate space, but I fixed it in about:config by switching full-screen:macos-native-full-screen to true. Now when I go into full screen the entire browser goes into a separate space.

I'm not entirely satisfied with it, so I went looking for something else. Multi-Account Container Tabs sounded more like what I needed.  But it isn't turning out that way. </p><p>I've created my containers -- after deciding on the order I want, as you cannot (apparently) rearrange them once created. But none of the instructions are quite clear on how to now assign all my favorite tabs to the correct containers. The instructions posted by Mozilla talk about sending links from pages but not so much about assigning specific tabs to containers. </p><p>I have managed to do this by accident once or twice; no idea how. But for the most part, even though I select the option to ""reopen in [name] container,"" and even though it appears to do so (in that it duplicates the tab and puts a color-coded line at the bottom of the tab), as soon as I close the tab, it is no longer listed under that container. Also, it seems only sporadically to retain the pinned tabs as pinned. </p><p>This whole process seems to be pointless if the extension can't retain the tabs in the containers where I reopen them (which is the only method I've seen so far to get them into a specific container) so that they can be pulled up again when that group is needed. I must be missing something. Could other extensions be interfering? (My context menu doesn't look quite like the images in the instructions, but at least the ""reopen in [name} container"" is an available option, even if I have to go an extra step to get to the actual list of containers. </p><p>I don't mind going the extra step and can clear up my context menu later; but why bother using this extension if the containers can't retain the web site tabs I assign them to (again, assuming that ""reopening"" to a specific container is the way to do this ... and maybe it isn't, but I can't find another way)? NOTE: I don't want to simply assign random links to containers; I want my specific TABS to open when I choose a container. </p><p>Again, I've read the instructions provided by Mozilla. Either 1) they aren't clear enough, 2) this extension doesn't do what I thought it did, or 3) I am missing something big-time. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.

So in the suggested way there's no hopping with the cursor (its movement reduces at least by 50%) and it is fast and intuitive in situations where you only glance the B tab, or both A and B: BAB; BABA; etc, but it can always be used.

Both of us are using Win 10 (his is 18##, mine is 1909), both using Firefox 77.0.1. When he tried to Present his screen, Firefox presented the various popups and permission pages I've seen in the answers here and on on the web.  When I try it, I keep getting blocked by Firefox. </p><p>I go into the Site Info &gt; more info for Google Meet via the URL bar and changed the Share the Screen setting to Always Ask since Allow isn't an option. </p><p>When I click the Share Screen icon in the FF URL bar, I get the pop-down that includes an Allow checkbox but it is grayed out so it cannot be checked, and a message stating Firefox cannot allow permanent access to my screen.  Which is fine, but it was giving me the exact same thing before I discovered the Meet URL &gt; right click &gt; Connection Secure &gt; More Information &gt; Permissions described above and pictured in one of the attached images showing I set it to Always Ask, which seems to be contrary to FF insistence that it won't allow me to permanently share. </p><p>When I once again try to Meet &gt; Present &gt; Window, I get the pop-up saying I have to give permission, thus throwing me back into the same frustrating loop. </p><p>Doubly frustrating is that my friend can share his screen going through the same steps I did, but he gets the pop-downs I see on the web that talk about ""only share in trusted sites"".  I have never been presented with those pop-downs, even after closing all my tabs, clearing my cache and closing my browser for a bit. </p><p>I thought Meet would be easier for some of my less-than-computer-literate friends and family to use, but I need to be able to share my screen with them as well as they theirs with me. </p><p>Halp! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1324076;1324217;,melissk

The win7_64 PC is used with developer apps and UAC is turned off, although there is other 3rd party browser protection running. </p><p>Both PCs have been running FF version 56 with all the tools and addons I know and love.  I also have a link to standalone chrome (dirty word) on each desktop. With more sites going HTTPS with higher security FFv56 was struggling with certificates. I upgraded the 32 bit PC to latest FFv77. The menue bar shows the Favicon in the top right corner for each site visited but when the URL is highlighted and dragged from the locked padlock it appears on the default Win7 blue background as the Firefox icon on a white background. Although I'd prefer the Favicon, I can live with that. </p><p>The Win7_64 no UAC PC running v56 has the same FF icon on a white background. I decided to uninstall V56 from Windows programs and install the latest V77. </p><p>The install finished with all the bookmark links as before (good) but the entire desk top of two monitors full of url links was changed to the FF icons with a BLACK background. On a pale blue screen this is a nightmare garish issue. I over came the first problem of not being able to drag urls by using the launcher switch -no-deelevate. The existing icon links stayed as FF icon on a black background.  </p><p>Then I went to Monitor display settings changing from 32bit to 16 bit colour rebooted and all the desktop links changed. (strange). After reading FF support guidance I changed UAC from zero to default, rebooted and just about everything on the desktop changed with Windows error messages popping up for applications.  I reverted back to AAC and the previous position. </p><p>O.K so now my option was to try an absolutely clean re-install of FFv77. To do this isn't so easy. I searched and found the Mozilla folders and profiles, but there was still an awful lot left in the registry including some keys from previous FF updates and versions. After cleaning that out manually the Win7_64 was as clean of Mozilla as I could make it. Installed latest FFv77 which booted to the default profile but all the existing desktop url links came back with black backgrounds - Horrible! </p><p>Throughout all of this, I can install and open Chrome (still with no PC UAC) and browse o.k, with no surprise changes to desktop links, problems accessing SSL protected sites or having to add custom switches to a startup launcher.  I don't know if my problems are Windows OS related or Firefox new versions have problems with Win7, but there is none of this with Chrome straight out of the box and the issue of Firefox icons and Favicons keeps being raised by others. Some may be able to put up with the black background URL links but when you have a screenful across two monitors IMHO it is really horrible. </p><p>I have an image backup to FFV56 and I'm willing to try something else. What is the default for the FF desktop URLs after a new build, is it a Favicon, Firefox icon on a black background or the same on a white bckground - or something else? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1323848;1324092;1324094;,Jimbo100

For obvious reasons, it can also not modify PDFs opened in Firefox' built-in viewer. However, Firefox seems to always disallow modification if the URL ends in <em>.pdf</em>, regardless of whether that page actually is a PDF file. This becomes a problem on Wikipedia, where <em>File:</em> page URLs always end in their respective file extension, although they are completely regular HTML pages (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExtIPA_chart_(2015).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>).

You know like when it says 'Sign up with Google or Facebook' and you just click that and enter your facebook/google login. So I'm confused now.

The mouse cursor changes to a ""loading"" cursor and starts flickering forever, trying to start Firefox. This is bad enough for my whole system to behave strangely, e.g. mouse clicks will randomly not register or release. </p><p>Upon inspecting the task manager, I find that `consent.exe` repeatedly pops up and disappears. I assume it crashes and then firefox tries to restart, repeating in an infinite loop ... I only recently found a dubious/hacky way to stop this without logging out or restarting my pc: When I forcefully rename `C:/Windows/System32/consent.exe` via console, e.g. to `.../consent.exe_`, Firefox will crash ""properly"" with an error message and I can rename it back. </p><p>I have no idea what this `consent.exe` does or why it is called, which makes finding the cause or fixing the issue very hard.. </p><p><br> <strong>Details / attempted fixes</strong> </p><p>The most recent time I had this issue, it appeared after trying to open an external link while Firefox was open. Firefox then found a new update and started automatically updating to the newest version (77.0.1), before trying to open the link and giving an error message (I don't remember what it was..). To properly apply the update I closed Firefox, tried to open it again, and I started getting this infinite crash loop. </p><p>This is not the first time I had this exact same issue, but the cause seems to vary. The first time I encountered this was back when there was a buggy Windows update, which if I read my logs correctly seems to have been at the end of February 2020. As far as I can remember at this time, the issue appeared immediately after restarting my PC and updating Windows (no opening of external links involved). The only way I managed to fix it was by uninstalling that Windows update. I disabled the following updates for some months. At this time I assumed the cause was the buggy Windows update, but since then I had the same issue 4 more times. Of the times I can remember the issue appeared immediately after </p> <ul><li> updating windows </li><li> ?? </li><li> ?? </li><li> clicking an external link </li><li> clicking an external link &gt; automatic Firefox update &gt; restart Firefox &gt; crash </li></ul> <p>Every time I got this issue I tried many things to fix it, including </p> <ul><li> restarting Firefox </li><li> restarting the PC </li><li> deleting my Firefox profiles in `%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` and `%AppData%\..\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` </li></ul> <p>none of the above worked any time I had this issue - nonetheless the issue would disappear randomly without me knowing what fixed it. </p><p>The first time when it was seemingly caused by the buggy Windows update, I even uninstalled and reinstalled all of Firefox, including deleting my Profiles in AppData. Even then, the issue persisted on a completely clean and barebone install of Firefox. However, since then it is seemingly caused by opening external links and the problem always randomly disappeared before I got to try a clean Firefox install. </p><p>The most recent time, the issue disappeared while I was trying `firefox.exe --version`, `firefox.exe --help` to find out my Firefox version (I don't know the correct commands, so nothing happened). This did not work, but when I then tried to start Firefox again, I got about 10 or so error messages on the first attempt (unfortunately, I don't remember the error message..), and then the issue was gone on the second attempt to restart Firefox. </p><p>One other random guess I have is that some of my about:config settings may be related, in particular I completely disabled any links from opening popups, be it a new tab or window. But this sounds really like a bug and I certainly do not want to undo this setting. </p> <hr> <p>In the end I am not even sure if this is a Firefox or Windows issue, and I am also not sure what would be a better place to look for support.

For the remaining logins that I can't eliminate, I get the message ""discard unsaved changes.""  If I do that, then the original user name and password returns.  So the system is not totally eliminating all the data.  One login and password in particular is troublesome because it's to my financial account.

On conspicuous and inconvenient result has been the disappearance from the upper toolbar of the several items that allow one to control the use of the browser in various ways:  File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools, Window, Help.  Access to some of these functions has evidently been relocated to small icons appearing in the upper right-hand corner of the browser-window.  Some, however, seem to appear nowhere.  Of particular annoyance to me personally are the following:  Previously (a) under ""File"", the ""New Tab"" opener seems nowhere to be found--as far as I can see, one can only open a ""New Window""; (b) under ""Edit"", the ""Undo"", ""Redo"", and ""Delete"" functions seem nowhere to be found.  Finally, is there no way to restore the previous much more accessible and versatile presentation of these functions in the toolbar of the desktop, rather than having them tucked away in the browser-window? </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-770;,firefox,other,en-US,1323105;,wgb.888

I could then just middle-click to paste the URL elsewhere for further use (eg, into an email). Anyone who uses X regularly knows that this is an essential core feature and part of everyday workflow. </li></ul> <p>This new auto-selection feature does not appear to work properly with X copy/paste: it seems that I now have to <strong>triple-click</strong>: </p> <ul><li> once to activate the urlbar (and (only) ""select"" the URL),  </li><li> again to unselect the URL,  </li><li> and, finally, a third time to re-select the URL and trigger the X select/copy function. </li></ul> <p>Is there a way to revert the previous behaviour, so that the urlbar is only ""activated"" with single-click, and requires double-click to actually select/copy the URL? </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1322927;1322928;1323038;,dmoz1

1290755,2020-06-11 02:48:54 -0800,2020-06-11T03:03:09Z,Unable to upload files using Firefox Ubuntu 18.04,"<p>Hello there, </p><p>I'm writing to report a problem that I had with Firefox. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, GNOME 3.28.2 with a 64-bit OS.  </p><p>Recently, I noticed that I could not save PDFs from the internet to my hard drive when I was using Firefox. Normally, if I had opened a PDF in Firefox, I could press 'Ctrl + S' on my keyboard and a save dialog window would appear. Now however, the save dialog window would not appear. No error messages appeared, so I have no screenshots to show. The only thing I could do to save the PDF was to click on the 'Download' icon in Firefox's PDF reader. Right-clicking on links to PDFs and selecting 'Save As' would yield the same result: no save dialog window, nothing. </p><p>I thought that the problem might be because my version of Firefox was not up to date, so I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install firefox' in the terminal. I also updated the flash plugin.  </p><p>Afterwards, I noticed that I could not upload files from my hard drive as an attachment for e-mails. I tried this on different websites and had the same problem. I tried the solutions described on the following pages, but none of them worked.

The problem remained.  </p><p>Then, I uninstalled the 77.0.1-1 version from the Snap Store and reinstalled the 77.0.1+build-1-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 version from ubuntu-bionic-updates-main. This resolved the problem. I can now save PDF files by pressing 'Ctrl+S' on my keyboard and i can upload files.  </p><p>I'm reporting this because I think other people might encounter the same problem as I did. Also, if it is possible, I think it would be better to coordinate with the people who maintain the Ubuntu software packages so that only one version of Firefox appears in the 'Ubuntu Software' program, instead of two. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;solved;firefox-770;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1322845;,hancheng.lie

Tis a relief :) </p><p>So the article above says to check this list @ <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements</a> for ""required libraries"".   I am really good at the command line except for checking library dependencies. :/ </p><p>Last link shows these 5: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item    GTK+ 3.4 or higher </li></ul> <pre>   * Bulleted list item    GLib 2.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    Pango 1.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    <a href=""http://X.Org"" rel=""nofollow"">X.Org</a> 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended) </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item        libstdc++ 4.7 or higher </li></ul> <p>My fear is i'll have to search around a while for the exact package name since sometimes capitalization and dashes matter when using apt, aptitude, or synaptic. </p><p>Here's what I am trying so far.   I started with libstdc++ since that's all lower case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $ apt list | grep libstdc++ | grep -v unstable ... ... (super long list of lots of different libstdc++) ... libstdc++6/stable 8.3.0-6 i386 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So since that ends with version 8.3 and that's higher than the ""4.7 or higher"" in the official list above, then I'm good. (By the way, just a plain `apt list libstdc++` returned no results.) </p><p>And substituting the word 'pango' in the above command gives a similarly long list that looks good, i think. Same with 'gtk3', 'glib2', and 'xorg'. </p><p>Oh, i think i've answered my own question :) but maybe went the scenic route with my command since i did not know the exact package names. </p><p>Anybody have a faster way of checking for these?  Pretty please? :) </p><p>P.S. By the way, I'm using Debian but in my experience it wouldn't matter if i was using Arch or even one of the BSD's right now.  Yes, tools are slightly different like apt/dpkg, or ports but am mostly curious for what exact package names to search for to save me time. :) </p><p>Thanks, you all rock.

Ideally, I want to have two Firefox windows open simultaneously.  One window would be logged into my work email account (on Gmail), have access to work-related bookmarks, show custom toolbars, etc -- even a different color theme, so when I hover over the Firefox icon in taskbar, I can easily identify which workspace is which. </em> Ditto for a personal workspace: different email accounts (one on Gmail, one on a private domain), bookmarks, toolbars, theme. I'd be able -- just by switching to a different Firefox window -- to switch between these two ""workspaces"", without needing to log out of one and log into another.  Maybe I could even synch each workspace with the matching ""user"" on my Android phone, which is set up with two users, each tied with a diff email account. I could accomplish most of this by using different browsers for each workspace, but I've been using Firefox since forever, am most comfortable with it, and would love to use it for both.

Mozilla Firefox becomes very slow for Google-based services (Google Search, Gmail, YouTube) and unresponsive when HTTP3 is enabled in about:config. Since QUIC is mostly a Google invention and Google services are the ones that utilize it the most, I wonder if Google deliberately slows down Firefox-based QUIC. The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services. There are other non-Google QUIC services and they are actually faster/quicker with Firefox HTTP3 flag enabled.

1290432,2020-06-09 04:08:22 -0800,2020-06-09T06:23:41Z,Display Problems while scrolling in Firefox,"<p>Hello, I am using the latest version of Firefox (77). In this version, but also all the previous versions, I have a problem while scrolling long web pages. Once I have scrolled down quite a bit to far below the immediately visible area, there will be a horizontal area across the entire browser window that does not show anything or is blacked out. It appears as if that area is covering up the info below it (as in a lower layer).  If I continue to scroll further down, these blacked out areas appear regularly. This forces me to switch to another browser (Chrome, Edge) where the problem does not occur, just so that I can read that info or access the buttons etc. hidden in FF.  I am working with a Lenovo Laptop attached to a docking station and two extra 27 inch screens that are turned to vertical and stand side by side.  The attached Screenshot gives you an idea. It was taken from this page: <a href=""https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/</a> with the parameter for number of items to display in the table below the map set to ""Alle"". The blacked-out area appears 8 or nine times. The page is only an example - the problem occurs on just about every page that requires a lot of downward scrolling. And the problem is also unrelated to a specific website. I can easily replicate it on this news portal aswell: <a href=""https://www.spiegel.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spiegel.de/</a>  </p><p>Does anyone have an idea how to fix this?

I can no longer use Firefox to pay online with StateFarm.  This started suddenly a few months ago. I had no problem navigating to the payment login page with State Farm, then one day I clicked the link and received an error page. I called State Farm Technical service and they suggested I try another browser.  It works fine in Chrome.  I like exclusively using Firefox.  Can this link be made to work on Firefox again? 2.  All of a sudden Firefox stopped opening links in webpage.  It doesn't open a new tab, it doesn't open Adobe Acrobat.  All I get is a flash of the download arrow.  I then need to go through multiple steps to download/open/save whatever it is I'm looking for.  If I don't see the flashing download arrow, it just looks like nothing has happened.  I'm assuming this change came in some update recently.  I have looked in options, but don't see how I can reset the options so links open automatically.   3.  In Options, I noticed a banner iYour browser is being managed by your organization.  I use Avast.  Your article about this suggests turning off Avast for web browsing, but that is advice in direct opposition to my computer guy.  I don't care about the banner if I know why it's there.

1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,2020-06-08T12:02:11Z,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"<p>I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"". This comparison exemplified that resource consuming from inside and outside looks very different. The second conclusion is that network usage ten or more times lower than disk usage, which should not be even if content is unpacked and saved. And the main question is why disk usage are close to memory consuming. This speaks in favor of the fact that disk usage is inefficient and surplus: most data can be stored in memory. Let's consider the attached screenshots. The first part of screenshot 'Firefox external metrics@77.0.1' consists of two parts with ProcessHacker window and contains the following external metrics of the parent firefox process: </p> <ul><li> Working set = 2 GB (summed over children processes) </li><li> Virtual size = 3.25 GB </li><li> Network total bytes = 287.1 MB </li><li> Disk total bytes = 3.02 GB </li><li> Disk write bytes = 2.48 GB </li><li> Disk read bytes = 551.23 MB </li></ul> <p>The firefox process structure is in the second part of that screenshot. The same observation -- excessive resource consuming exemplified by the same metrics. To estimate total memory consuming, I closed Firefox and compared memory usage by ""System information"" (ProcessHacker's tool): the commit charge level decreased by 4.2 GB and the physical memory level decreased by 2.7 GB. This means that 1.5 GB memory pages are in the paging file, i.e. stored on the disk! In comparison with Windows 7 memory consuming, we see 748 MB versus 2.7 GB in physical memory. Does Firefox indeed execute so many tasks and provide so many functions and deliver so much value as Windows 7 Pro operating system? The comparison Firefox versus MS Word 2010 with 20 opened documents (about 200 MB RAM consumed) leads to the same observation: the former has much higher resource consuming per functionality/value. </p><p>However, Firefox's ""about:cache"" and ""about:performance"" don't report such resource consuming: see the according screenshots. I summed memory usage by web pages enumerated in ""about:performance"": all 16 loaded web pages consumed 522 MB in total instead of 2.7GB physical memory and 4.2 GB virtual memory. What does Firefox really do?! This is why I suppose that Firefox executes hidden extraneous tasks. To those who would like to analyze Firefox's memory report in detail, I saved and published it: <a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg</a>  </p><p>My point is that disk I/O operations should be decreased significantly in order to prevent Firefox from hanging and to decrease response time on user actions. There are several measures to do it. First, stop using RAM in uncontrolled and ineffective manner as we saw it even on 16 web pages. This means estimating and measuring memory overhead per content byte, per user-level function and per delivered value. Second, stop using disk-based databases, use in-memory databases instead. Third, use effective data structures and data architecture. To prevent memory page unloading, use OS API to disallow unloading of desired memory pages using proper attribute. Yes, if your data/programming languages do not satisfy these critical requirements, use another one. If your data/programming technology do not satisfy these critical requirements, just change it. If your values interfere with this approach, then make the browser’s mission to be the main value -- visualizing hypertext to the user quickly, cheaply, conveniently and effectively. All other values around it have lower priority, remember! No one need safety and transparency and so on if the browser hangs with other process in the system or web page loads more than 0.5 second on a real device. This means you should not suppose the modern or superpower device -- you should suppose any device with one CPU of 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM. These resources are enough to display even 100 pages of 1 MB each in size, obliviously. Just because 1920x1600 = 3072000 bytes (one byte per pixel), i.e. about 3 MB per screen image. The main thing the browser do is it transforms 1 MB of input content into 3 MB image of output. Five or eight GB of RAM is too excessive to this operation, isn't it? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-770;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321683;,alexworad

Now this doesn't happen when in normal mode meaning not in picture in picture mode, So basicly i'm saying could you guys look into making picture in picture full screen mode not make the screen go to sleep like in a normal player, I understand I can also turn off picture in picture mode or turn my screen auto turn off after a few minutes off but I would think it would be much better if the picture in picture full screen mode worked the same as watching something in a normal player which doesn't make your screen turn off, Not sure if its a bug or was just over looked either way thought I would let you guys know. Also want to add that picture in picture mode is a great idea, I have always wanted to beable to watch something while working when only having 1 screen and picture in picture works great for that keep up the good work!

Now after the update to 77, the Megabar is back and forced down everyone's throat and the old about:config is no longer the fix to this terrible experience. Literally after an hour of this trashbar being up, videos and guides popped up to try to fix it. Whole communities have been formed to hate this feature and ask Firefox to change it, or at least make it optional to go back.  My question is, looking through google has only come up with the chrome.css(?) fix to this mess.

I didn't like it when it was defaulted to being on starting with version 75 but I was able to easily switch a few setting in about:config to fix it. Those settings no longer affect the address bar as of update 77. </p><p>The settings I had changed were: </p><p>browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus browser.urlbar.update1 browser.urlbar.update1.interventions browser.urlbar.update1.searchTips </p><p>which were all set to false. I saw that setting ""browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests"" to ""true"" might be the solution but, while it does stop the address bar from expanding when using it, it also stops it from expanding at all so the websites that would come up from searching can no longer be seen either (they are still called and using the down arrow will let me scroll through the results, I just can't see any of them). It also doesn't fix the results issue which I would say is the most important. </p><p>I would like to know what I need to do so that: 1. The results it shows me are no longer based on frequent visit (basically, the pre-update search system, as is they are scattered and look messy, pulling many different sites in a seemingly random order and it's not particularly useful) 2. It no longer autocompletes results (IE. ""F"" autocompleting to ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"", this is always something that has bothered me regardless is context) 3.

I'm working to save people's lives against COVID-19, and Firefox, not Chrome is causing ALLof my gmail accounts to quickly and automatically sign out. For almost a month, and with great diligence and frustration in trying to troubleshoot this a couple of different ways (according to Mozilla and others)), nothing has prevailed.  </p><p>Could it be the great number of open windows and tabs that cause it, because that is my last (but not yet tested theory).  Most of the times the sign out occurs when the email draft automatically saves itself, and the site disconnects. How I know this, is gmail says it's trying to reconnect. There's also a message saying my hangouts isn't signed in, but neither is it signed in with Chrome  One more thing. Every day for the last 3 years, I use CC cleaner to remove cookies and cache, so it can't be that. You'll have to come up with something Mozilla hasn't yet thought of yet. </p><p>And lastly, Firefox Lockwise (when it was active), prevented me from finding my ""SAVED LOGINS"", gmail account. Not even the search engine could find it (both when Lockwise was active, and after I cancelled the account). This program prevented me from finding my own password, which was needed urgently. And now, I can't get rid of Lockwise, even after cancelling the account. Anf from what I see, I'm forced to sign up with the account again, just to ask this question. Nobody likes the bully, so please help me PERMANENTLY remove Lockwise from my system?

I hated the URL bar that was added in 75 and found it back again in 77 so I tried to turn it off again. After finding that the only solution effectively broke the URL bar (switching browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests to false for reference which stopped it from expanding at all, including to see the websites in the drop down) and no other setting changes did anything, I tried going back to version 76 since the URL bar remained as I had set it in 75. However, because of the profile protection, I would need to manually add everything back (on top of that, I couldn't restore the URL bar with the changes that worked in 75 anyway) so, deciding it wasn't worth the trouble, I updated back up to version 77. </p><p>Now, a few websites aren't loading correctly. For example, YouTube only loads gray placeholder boxes and the sidebar elements are completely unresponsive. Trying to load a video from history also doesn't work as the page just remains blank. YouTube isn't the only site with this issue either though they have varying degrees of functionality. However, I don't know why those sites aren't working while others that I would think are somewhat similar (IE. DeviantArt, Reddit) are working.

It's especially helpful when I only have one monitor. There are a couple of rough-edges I'd like to see tweaked. </p><p>1. I resize these windows all the time to put them where they'll fit when I'm doing something else, and it can finicky to resize the window quickly. It would be helpful if the areas you can grab the edges and corners of were exaggerated. For example, if when the user's mouse is near an edge or corner of the picture-in-picture window a handle pops-up around the given area that's larger than the 1pixal-ish default handle area. I've seen similar functionality in the art program GIMP for selection boxes. </p><p>2. The way the window acts when being resized isn't very intuitive. The corners work as expected, but since the corner areas are so small I often grab the sides and that can get frustrating. I now know that when grabbing the Bight and Bottom sides of the window the Top-Left corner is anchored while resizing. Similarly, when grabbing the Left and Top sides of the window the Bottom-Right corner is anchored.  That seems pretty intuitive when I type it out, what's the issue? Well, the problem comes when you are grabbing the window near the corners. If for example, I'm trying to grab the window by the Bottom-Left corner and miss (which I've done plenty) and grab the Bottom of the window. Now when I resize the window is anchored in the Top-Left instead of the Top-Right, which is the opposite of what I wanted and leads to some confusion and repositioning. What I would suggest, separate from the #1 solution, would be to break the sides of the window into three areas: Near-corner 1, Center, and Near-corner 2. When grabbing the window on the edge in one of the Near-corner areas, anchor the window at the opposite corner. When grabbing by the center of an edge anchor the window by the opposite center.  </p><p>Thank you for reading my long suggestion. I hope you don't find this to be a negative interaction. I truly enjoy Firefox, and I've very excited about your new Picture-in-picture feature. I hope you understand that this level of nit-picking can only come from a place of love!  </p><p>P.S: I'm very pleased to say that I did not include a third issue I had with the Spacebar Play/Pause functionality not working unless the Play button was the last object clicked on the window, because in the latest update it was gone! I want to thank whomever worked on that and let them know, someone did notice, and they appreciate it! &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;feature-request;firefox-770;,firefox,customize,en-US,1321030;,darkkenchi

It outputs in the millivolt range. </p><p>This was driving me crazy, until I diagnosed what was causing it. </p><p>Viewing a web page, I'd immediately get FM interference, making the streaming FM audio, raspy and unlistenable, as soon as I clicked the ""reader view"" icon on the toolbar.  Sometimes, I could click the icon again, to revert to the ""normal"" web page view, and the interference would stop.  And clicking the icon to return to ""reader view"" again, the sound was O.K. </p><p>Other times, I'd have to close the tab entirely (which stopped the interference) allowing the streaming audio on the other tab to continue without interference.  I could then open the tab on the ""offending"" site again, and the audio was O.K.  I'd just continue with this tab in ""normal"" web page view. </p><p>Now, I know there are folks ""out there"", who are just as nerdy as I am, who are curious about how ""reader view"" is causing FM interference.

However, my mental defects prevented me finding any explanation created since the formation of the internet (I am estimating the internet first formed in 2008, because the dates of the answers I found indicated as such (anything before 2013 is basically the same as 2008 for internet purposes).

What I need from them is to behave the way it will be most practical for me, which isn't necessarily aligned with the majority of users. </p><p>My current problem is this. I work with APIs which in my daily work often return various HTTP errors. These errors also contain a payload which describes the problem in detail. I want to be able to see this payload easily in the browser. Yes, I can use other tools like Postman for this (which I do), but for simple GET requests without special request headers it would be much more practical to just use a browser. </p><p>Currently, when my API opens an error (for example a 400 Bad Request), Firefox decides to just silently go back into the previous page (undos the URL change). If I open the Network tab in the Web Developer view, I can however see the failing response with all of its details. Still, this is too impractical for me. </p><p>BTW, the response contains a custom Content-Type which isn't recognized by Firefox by default. But Firefox isn't downloading the payload as a file (like it would usually do for a successful page load of an unknown Content-Type), it just silently doesn't do anything. I've installed an extension to handle my custom Content-Types (called ""Open in Browser""), but since Firefox isn't attempting to open this one, I can't use it in this case. </p><p>So, how can I force Firefox to stay on that URL and show the response payload in the window? If not in vanilla Firefox, any plugins?

During the meeting, when I navigate to other windows, there's small a FireFox window that allows me to navigate back to the meeting, and is shown on top of all other windows. So far so good.  The problem is that meetings end, I close the meeting windows, but this small Windows stay on top, cannot be closed, clicking on it does nothing.  I can just move it right and left. How can I get rid of it when there's no meeting? Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;webcompat;windows-10;googlemeet;microphone;firefox-770;googlemeet77;microphoneicon77;bug1636496;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1319028;1319035;1319040;1319043;1319131;1319132;1319227;1319291;,utidhar

The console log looks like this: </p><p>ERROR Error: ""Uncaught (in promise): S: {""headers"":{""normalizedNames"":{},""lazyUpdate"":null,""headers"":{}},""status"":504,""statusText"":""Gateway Timeout"",""url"":""https://myurl.myurl/profil"",""ok"":false,""name"":""HttpErrorResponse"",""message"":""Http failure response for https://myurl.myurl/profile: 504 Gateway Timeout"",""error"":null}"" </p><p><br> Replaying request: Very useful feature, however it seems to have an issue with Authentication headers. When my angular application does a service call it works fine. When I then replay this request I get the response of the backend: 401 you are not logged in. Upon closed inspection I printed out the headers in this response and noted that after replaying the request the header ""Authentication: Bearer ...."" is missing. </p><p>Any hints how to fix these issues? </p><p>Also is this the correct space to report issues/bugs?

I'd just like to understand. </p><p>A few years ago, it was necessary to install a plugin in order to playback a video (for instance the VLC-web-plugin). Nowadays, plugins are not necessary. You can just assign an application such as VLC player to a specific file type (In Firefox -&gt; Options -&gt; General -&gt; Applications you can choose which file type is opened with which application). But whats the technical difference between VLC installed on operating system level and VLC as a web-plugin of Firefox? Both are external programs (locally installed) started from within the browser. </p><p>I know, that it is the goal of web2.0 to get rid of the plugins, as they are security risks and not user-friendly.

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-760;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;1319551;1319559;,ji.perez.marturet

I've done that before with support services I have called with no problems (note *I* called them), but this felt questionable.

History problem),"<p>Hi. </p><p>I love Firefox specifically because it lets me use Ctrl+Shift+N, i.e. reopen a closed window. I have this one window with several pinned tabs (Facebook etc.) and a few other open tabs (some reseach, YouTube etc.) where I keep things that I need to return to. I essentially NEVER close this window without reopening it, because it has the most important things I need. Sometimes I open a second/third window to work in (I had an online exam the other day, so I opened that and my materials in a separate window, so I can cycle through them more easily). </p><p>When I open this second window, sometimes I close my main window (it has quite a few tabs so it slows Firefox down). I then always reopen it using Ctrl+Shift+N and never had a problem. Well, I closed it now (then opened one or two other new windows), but when I wanted to reopen my main window back up, it just refused to. It's gone from ""recently closed windows"". Interestingly enough, at least two other windows I closed BEFORE it (one from yesterday, that I did unrelated googling in; the other was closed a couple minutes before the main window, it was an emoticon set that pops up from one forum) were possible to reopen, but not my main window. Now I can reopen just 3 windows, and I don't understand where they are (there used to be up to ~10 or so).  </p><p>I want to know why I was able to reopen windows I closed long ago, but not the most recent one, and whether there is a way to fix this and get the main window back. I have effectively lost ~40 tabs that I had open (some research articles, pinned social media, some stuff I wanted to read etc.) that I can't even reopen unless I find them through my History (and hoo boy, that'd take a while). </p><p>Thanks for any info. Have a nice day. </p><p><br> SOLVED - EDIT: The amount of windows that can be reopened can be fixed as mentioned below. Lost window probably cannot be restored, sadly. EDIT 2: Actually it can be restored! See the answer to find out how.
