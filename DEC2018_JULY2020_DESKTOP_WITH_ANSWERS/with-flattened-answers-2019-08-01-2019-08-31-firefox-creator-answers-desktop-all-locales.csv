To see the tab history and potential click back more than one page, right-click the Back button to drop the tab history list. </p><p>(2) When you click a link, Firefox stores the vertical position on the page (for example 2000 pixels down). When you go back, Firefox tries to stay at that position, but sometimes due to different sized ads, or delayed image loads, that turns out to be the wrong place on the page. So if you are finding Firefox goes back to the correct page but the incorrect section, that could be the issue and I might have a suggestion for something to test out. </p> id:1248113,created:2019-08-31 09:31:15 -0800,updated:2019-08-31 09:31:15 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I get around this by; When I find a link I want to check out, I open it in a new tab/window.

I also didnât find a browser.css file. So I tried cutting and pasting your suggestion below into my userChrome.css with no change in the color of the inactive FF window. So to override that, you could try setting the same background color for inactive:  '''''<em><strong>/* Inactive title bar same background color as active */ </strong></em> </p> <dl><dd>root:-moz-lwtheme:-moz-window-inactive { </dd></dl> <pre> background-color: var(--lwt-accent-color)Â !important; </pre> <p>} /* Same text color in inactive as active */ </p> <dl><dd>root[tabsintitlebar]:not([inFullscreen]):-moz-window-inactive { </dd></dl> <pre> color: CaptionTextÂ !important; </pre> <p>}'''''<em><strong> </strong></em> Next I created the userContent.css file and then cut and pasted the above into it, then saved this css file in the Chrome folder but again. No change. Then I added the following to the user Content.css file but again no change:  '''''<em><strong>/* Same text color in inactive as active */ </strong></em> </p> <dl><dd>root[tabsintitlebar]:not([inFullscreen]):-moz-window-inactive { </dd></dl> <pre> color: CaptionTextÂ !important; </pre> <p>}<em><strong> </strong></em> <em><strong> </strong></em> Lastly, to be sure we are on the same pageâ¦When FF is the active window, the title bar is a nice rich blue but when the FF window is inactive, it becomes this washed out gray with the menu and the âXâ at the far right are the same color and so almost invisible. All I really want is to change the font color of the menu and the minimize and exit symbols to something darker than the inactive title bar color (in this case gray) so that I can see them. I donât care that the inactive FF windowâs title bar is grayâ¦that is fine. </p><p>I didnât think this would be so hard or complicated to do. </p><p>I really appreciate your help, but at this point, since I am at the zenith of my understanding of all this, I must not be doing something correctly or understand what you are trying to help me with. </p> id:1248189,created:2019-08-31 16:25:40 -0800,updated:2019-08-31 16:25:40 -0800,creator:bmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks, I'll look at this soon.

I know I could ditch my current profile and use a new one but I'd like to repair it if possible. </p><p>Any suggestions pls? </p><p>Thanks! </p>,windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-680;firefox-6802;,firefox,other,en-US,1248026;1248075;1248139;1248147;1248170;1248228;1248241;1248251;1248254;1248272;,david.matthewson,"id:1248272,created:2019-09-01 06:08:09 -0800,updated:2019-09-01 06:08:09 -0800,creator:david.matthewson,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>No, Thank you! - Enjoy too.. </p> id:1248254,created:2019-09-01 04:01:36 -0800,updated:2019-09-01 04:01:36 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I'm so glad you got things back to normal again   -   well done Â ! </p><p>Enjoy the rest of your day. </p> id:1248251,created:2019-09-01 03:51:33 -0800,updated:2019-09-01 03:51:33 -0800,creator:david.matthewson,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Total genius! </p><p>Worked perfectly.

The loading spinner was rotating indefinitely, and nothing happened. Safe mode did work. So I turned off the only plugin I had, but it didn't help. I uninstalled all the dictionaries, plugins, extensions, themes, everything. Restarted pc, restarted ff, to no avail. The problem persisted. </p><p>Everything worked in safe-mode, but not in the default one. </p><p>So I backed up all my bookmarks and decided to uninstall ff. But before that I made sure that I'm signed in to FF Sync, and the tabs are synced (there is a checkbox ""Open tabs"" which was checked and is checked now). </p><p>After reinstalling Firefox I found out that the folder called ""Old Firefox Data"" appeared. I still have it. I signed in to sync and found zero tabs there. None. All the bookmarks are in place, the history is there, but no tabs. </p><p>Could you please help me restore the tabs? </p><p>Copypasting ""Old Firefox Data"" into the ""Local Directory"" (from about:profiles) didn't help. </p><p>What is the point of syncing my open tabs if they are wiped out exactly when I need them?

I have pics on google photos dating from current time going back to 2003.  there are a lot of photos.  there is a vertical timeline on the right side of the screen. when I open the google photos webpage, sometimes, but not always, the 1st month or so will load and I can see the images, although often, but not always, they are very low res.  sometimes after a minute or two the resolution becomes normal.  as I scroll down, once I get past where pics have loaded, there will usually be a number of the gray boxes that do not show the image, but they are ""active""... I can click on them and see the pic individually.  As I go further down the page, the gray boxes are not active... clicking on them does not open a pic.  Also, there will be gaps where some pics load, then active gray boxes, then more loaded pics, then active gray boxes, then dead gray boxes.  </p><p>If I go to the last active pic and open it, I can use the arrow button and see the pics that in the gallery view are dead, then when I go back to gallery view, sometimes those pics will have loaded, sometimes not. </p><p>sometimes when switching between viewing an individual pic and the gallery, pics that had previously been visible will be back to gray boxes. </p><p>letting the website sit there waiting for it to load does nothing. </p><p>Again, none of this happens in google chrome. I live in a rural area with pretty slow dsl, so it does take time for everything to load, but I just don't get these weird symptoms in chrome.  Once they have loaded they are there and don't disappear again, and I can use the timeline on the right to jump around and once everything is loaded, it will all still be there.  not so in firefox.  sometimes if I jump from one spot in the timeline to where pics had been loaded they will be gone again and sometimes they will be there. </p><p>If I had to guess I'd say it's something about the combination of the slow internet speed and how firefox uses memory...  My current pc has 32GB of memory though... my last one had 4 and the symptoms were the same with it, so adding memory doesn't seem to be a factor. </p><p><br> tried resetting IE, no change.  I think I'd rather just use chrome than keep trying to get it to work on firefox.  It works as it should on chrome.  I guess I'm just curious as to what would cause this.  I don't know much about all this but I'm skeptical it's an antivirus software issue (I use Webroot antivirus). </p> id:1247766,created:2019-08-29 21:16:28 -0800,updated:2019-08-29 21:16:28 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>To clarify why Fred was likely asking you to run in Windows Safe Mode with networking, they  are trying to rule out a conflict with your security software. Some firewalls or anti-virus protection programs may block Firefox from connecting to certain websites by mistake. So running in Windows Safe Mode would rule that out since the security software would be disabled while running in that mode. </p><p>But to add onto the possible solutions, there are a couple of things that I would recommend if Windows Safe Mode doesn't yield any positive results. </p><p>The first thing will sound weird, but I've seen it fix odd partial connectivity issues like yours before... try resetting Internet Explorer. Like I said, it may seem strange, but I've seen it help before. </p><p>To do that, follow these steps: </p> <ol><li> In Windows search, find the <strong>Internet Options</strong>. </li><li> Navigate to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. </li><li> Press the <strong>Reset...</strong> button under the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer settings</strong> section. </li><li> Press <strong>Reset</strong>. </li><li> Restart your computer. </li></ol> <p>If that doesn't help, you can also try clearing your DNS cache. The DNS is the service that tells your computer what server to connect to. It's possible that the DNS has saved an incorrect location and needs to be refreshed. I've seen it cause issues in some browsers but not others. </p><p>On Windows, you can easily clear the DNS cache by doing the following: </p> <ol><li> Press Windows key + R on your keyboard. </li><li> Type <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> (There is a space before the slash). </li><li> Press <strong>Ok</strong>. </li></ol> <p>If that doesn't help, you can also try <a href=""/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">refreshing Firefox</a>. This process will restore Firefox to its default state while saving your essential information like bookmarks, passwords, and open tabs. It fixes many issues of this nature. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1247747,created:2019-08-29 18:59:22 -0800,updated:2019-08-29 18:59:22 -0800,creator:mijff,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>already tried deleting cookies and cache.

I know I should have been Googling for 'prefs'; but one of your answers was titled 'about:config entries'; and I was Googling for 'Firefox ""about:config"" '. </p><p>I have not read thru your docs yet; so I'm not sure if I have any remaining questions. ...but this is certainly great help!!! </p> <hr> <p>To answer Wesley's question ' <em>Is there a particular preference that you are looking for or need explained?</em> '... I need to give a little preface: </p><p>About a month ago, I was redirected to a malware site.  It kept popping up diaboxes [i.e. your computer is infected...].  I could not close the tab and the computer became unresponsive.   I could not bring up TaskMgr, or do anything! In the end I had to pull the plug. (with 20 years of my life on this machine; that was the last thing I wanted to do) When the machine came back up (and after I had run DISKCHK /f on all three drives); I opened Firefox's history and blacklisted that URL. </p><p>Yesterday, same thing [different URL]. But yesterday [after 20 minutes of fighting], I got <strong>SysInternals Process Explorer</strong> running.  I found out the PC was unresponsive because Firefox was using 10GB of memory. So the computer was disk bound swapping to the paging file. </p><p>I am there for trying to put a maximum memory limit on Firefox. May be 1.5GB per tab or 3GB on everything.  </p><p>P.S.: I had already found 'browser.tabs.unloadOnLowMemory'. But that closes idle tabs. Not what I'm trying to do. </p> id:1247485,created:2019-08-28 20:02:05 -0800,updated:2019-08-28 20:02:05 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There is no concise documentation of the the prefs that you see on the about:config page. </p><p>You can check out the comments in the Firefox source code or search the mozilla-release on the DXR website for a specific preference. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/modules/libpref/init/all.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/modules/libpref/init/all.js</a> </li><li><a href=""https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/browser/app/profile/firefox.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/browser/app/profile/firefox.js</a> </li></ul> <p>See also the MDN website for documentation. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US</a> </li></ul> id:1247484,created:2019-08-28 19:56:38 -0800,updated:2019-08-28 19:56:38 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Because of the fact that there are thousands of preferences and they do change from time to time as new ones are added and old ones are taken away, I'm not sure that there really is a ""complete"" list of every preference. </p><p><a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_Entries"" rel=""nofollow"">MozillaZine has a decent list on their website</a>, although it hasn't been updated since 2017 so it may be incomplete/outdated. </p><p><a href=""http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Preferential Project also has an ok list</a>, although it's even older than the one above. </p><p>I think you'll find that there really is no complete list of every about:config preference.

1267624,2019-08-28 17:31:36 -0800,2019-08-29T09:30:10Z,Cookies Breaking Websites?,"<p>I posted the below a couple of days ago and I did get a couple of suggestions as to how to fix that seemed to revolve around cookies. I found my way into a place on FF where I was able to 'forget' a website which seemed to fix the <a href=""http://vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vegas.com</a> site. However after trying to make a reservation on the site later in the evening the same problem appeared. Pick travel date particulars and the site skips over what should be the next twp steps (booking the hotel &amp; flights) No amount of cookie and or history clearing seems to make the site work again. Seems to me that the security built in to FF is a tad too strict or something and keeps sites from loading correctly, Redbox still will not remember my log-in credentials from step to step while trying to rent movies on line. Anyone else have some suggestions? Disabling all Tracker / Ad  Blockers does not seem to help either. </p><p>As before, these problems do not occur if I use MS Edge. </p><p>Since my move to a new PC running Windows 10 64 bit and with the latest version of FF a couple of websites that I frequent no longer work. They will work in MS Edge, but not Firefox. These two websites are <a href=""http://Redbox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Redbox.com</a> and <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a> For Redbox their system can not seem to retain my login information during a session. Each thing I try to do asks me to reenter my log-in info. Can no longer rent movies. For <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a>, if I try to look at Air/Hotel packages the website always skips the pick a hotel and pick a flight steps and goes right to the option to pick a show to see. Again, this does not happen if I use MS Edge. What could be going wrong with FF new attention to privacy and security that is breaking these sites. I have shut off Content Blocking on both of these sites already. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-680;firefox-6802;,firefox,other,en-US,1247499;1247590;1247592;1247594;1247605;,jrmoob,"id:1247605,created:2019-08-29 09:30:10 -0800,updated:2019-08-29 09:30:10 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Are you in a Private Window or do you have 'Always Use Private Mode When Browsing' set in your Options? </p> id:1247594,created:2019-08-29 08:57:43 -0800,updated:2019-08-29 08:57:43 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>My mistake.

It opens up a new, clean profile in a new window (About FF now says 68.0.1 in this version of FF, and it downloads 68.0.2 and prompts to Restart FF (again)).  At which point it runs ""a new helper tool"" and re-updates FF to 68.0.2.  I then have to mess with about:profiles to go back to my profile.  Things then run routinely for a few hours or a day, before the whole routine starts over again. </p><p>Alternately, if FF 68.0.2 is not running, if I open it (after opening and closing it several times without issue), I will get a message that ""You've launched an older version of FF, Create New Profile or Quit"".  Create New Profile leads me through the routine above. </p><p>Versions of the above routine have happened not just between 68.0.2 and 68.0.1, but also between earlier version updates.  That is, this has been going on for months.  It does seem in the last couple of weeks that the interval of time has shortened and I'm having to do this routine everyday or even multiple times a day. I have no problems like this with FF on any other machine. </p><p>I've tried:  </p><p>Trashing FF and re-dl'ing from Mozilla.  No dice.

In recent weeks Firefox has begun to save my search history across multiple sessions (image 1), without any settings having been altered.  This is alarming, as not only have I instructed Firefox not to save search history (image 2) and disabled history in Sync settings (image 3), but as you see I've also set it to clear history when closing, which of late seems to do nothing.  Even after clearing history manually, searches I've made days ago still pop up in my Google suggestions after restarting the browser.  Everything you see in purple is stuff I searched for last Friday, and even had the computer shut off over the weekend. </p><p>This happens even if I restart Firefox with all add-ons disabled.  I've trawled the forums looking for a solution, but everything I've found is pretty old &amp; involves ""about:config"" parameters that no longer apply as of quite a few versions ago. </p><p>Notice I have Google search suggestions turned on (image 4), but from my understanding this is separate from saving history, and should merely suggest frequently searched keywords.  Of note is that the history in image 1 does not show up if searching Google from the address bar. </p><p>Completely at a loss for how to fix this.

1267456,2019-08-26 06:26:58 -0800,2020-02-13T14:39:46Z,How can I stop Firefox from all website security warnings and blocks?  Firefox is almost getting useless due to this blocking,"<p>Firefox is far too extreme in blocking access to websites preventing me from browsing for ""connection"" and ""security certificate"" so-called ""issues/errors"".  It almost regularly attempts to block me from accessing websites such as, for example, CNN (!!)  for security certificate issues, and in many cases absolutely will not allow me to browse to some websites.  This gets to the point where I have to switch to a different browser to visit websites I have been using for &gt;&gt;decades&lt;&lt;.  How can I **completely** shut off ALL Firefox security monitoring to allow ME to decide what I want to view?  </p><pre>Just FYI, I have NO PROBLEM with websites tracking my visits, I actually prefer that.  As well, I have NEVER seen any problems with security certificates endangering me at any of the websites I view, whether the website's certificate is current or not.  I am quite capable of judging for myself whether a website poses any danger to my PC, and I have an AV utility that does an excellent job of protecting my PC, I do NOT need any help from Firefox. I never visit websites that would even remotely present a danger to my system, I am not into games, dark web idiocy, or any other such dangerous sites and I know what to look for to decide the reliability of any site I visit.  I have NEVER, in over 25 years, been hacked or endangered, so I need no help from Firefox. </pre> <p>Thanks for any help, </p><p>Pete B </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-680;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1246829;1246842;1246959;1246966;1247074;1247090;1247091;1247124;1283650;1284245;1289916;1289953;1289987;1289990;,petebarnes,"id:1289990,created:2020-02-13 14:39:46 -0800,updated:2020-02-13 14:39:46 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi Rhonda, Natalie posted in your thread earlier today.

I have read about all the different menus I need to access and still NO CONCISE directions. I chose to use Firefox because I have heard and read good things about your browser, but you're becoming more and more like Microsoft Windows 10, where they think we're all computer programmers, IT personnel; I don't even understand some of the terminology you are using. I have been using computers from the good old-fashioned days of DOS, through all of the Windows platforms, but they are becoming NON-USER FRIENDLY, and that's how I'm feeling about Firefox. </p> id:1247124,created:2019-08-27 09:29:34 -0800,updated:2019-08-27 09:29:34 -0800,creator:petebarnes,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>AS I mentioned before, I do not have a problem with tracking, in fact I prefer it. </p><p>What Kaspersky does is allow me to make exceptions tp prevent such warnings from causing me to be blocked.  I can see the importance of monitoring such cert issues, but I see no reason why that should allow FF to absolutely block me from a website.  If I was on a corporate network, OK, but not for my home PC. </p><p>Despite the fears expressed, I have been using KAV for about the last couple of decades, I have never ever had **any** problems or indications that it caused me harm. I don't need nor want any such oversight.  And as I also said, I do get plenty of such monitoring from KAV every day, but I can always tell KAV to override any blocking. </p><p>Pete B </p> id:1247091,created:2019-08-27 07:56:35 -0800,updated:2019-08-27 07:56:35 -0800,creator:user633449,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Note that Kaspersky does more shady things than just hijacking your secure connection. </p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/kaspersky-av-injected-unique-id-into-webpages-even-in-incognito-mode/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/kaspersky-av-injected-unique-id-into-webpages-even-in-incognito-mode/</a> </p> id:1247090,created:2019-08-27 07:54:19 -0800,updated:2019-08-27 07:54:19 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Pete, there's no way to set Firefox not to verify HTTPS connections.

My point is, Kaspersky's AV does all the monitoring I need, I do not need Firefox to do any such monitoring at all. And the KAV is not perfect, either,it makes a lot of dumb assumptions, too, in this area, especially with certs or with, say, a website that wants tro redirect you to another site, which it assumes is ""dangerous"".  But at least my KAV allows me to ignore this warning in every case, unlike Firefox. </p><p>Of course, part of this is the fact that a whole slew of everyday websites have these issues now and then, I get these ""alerts"" from all kinds of sites that are absolutely secure, lke my bank, my financial manager, my local and national news sites, etc. but at least KAV allows me to add such sites to a list of exmptions from such warnings, unlike Firefox, which has no such provision when it really refuses to allow me to connect to a website it deems ""dangerous"". </p><p>If this whole issue was treated th same by all web browsers, I would agree that it was worht the attention in some cases, but that is not the case.  In every instrance I have the lockout by Firefox, I can immediately start up Chrome or IE and go tro the site uninhibited, and it has NEVER caused me a problem.  So all I want is for Firefox to let ME decide what is forbidden and what is not. </p><p>So if you know of a way to inhibit the total lockouts by Firefox, please let ne know.  I like Firefox best of the three browsers I use, but this issue is really aggravating me to the point I may have to switch  to another browser as my default. </p><p>Thanks,  </p><p>Pete B </p> id:1246966,created:2019-08-26 16:51:10 -0800,updated:2019-08-26 16:51:10 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Hi Pete, since you mention Kaspersky, the issue could be caused by its filtering feature.  </p><p>If you'll allow me to explain: Kaspersky, Avast, AVG, Bitdefender, ESET, and probably some other products intercept your browsing to filter what is going out to and coming back from websites. In order to be able to read content sent on a secure connection, Kaspersky generates a fake website certificate for each site. Naturally, these fake certificates do not check out, so Firefox rejects them.  </p><p>In order to get Firefox to trust the fake site certificates, you need the Kaspersky certificate used to sign the fake certificates set up as a trusted authority in Firefox. </p><p>Normally, Kaspersky products take care of this setup for you automatically at Windows startup, and it should stick until your Firefox certificate store is refreshed, for example, by using the Refresh feature or manually deleting the cert9.db file, or if you start using a new profile. In those cases, the setup needs to be done again. </p><p>You try going into Kaspersky's settings and pushing the certificate over to Firefox from there.

The first Quantum version was Firefox 57 <em>(November 14, 2017)</em> so a recent update shouldn't have caused this issue. A real update typically doesn't involve ""importing"" bookmarks or any other user data; the Profile is ""converted"" for the latest version automatically. </p><p>On the other hand, if you recently <strong>installed</strong> Firefox 68 anew, <em>rather than updating</em>,  perhaps the new installation created a new Profile assuming that it was a 2nd version in addition to an old, existing version. That is a new feature in Firefox 68 where the user can have multiple versions of Firefox installed, each with its own Profile which is used automatically without user intervention. </p><p>What other data types are you missing, beyond bookmarks? Browsing History?  Logins / Passwords data?   How about old add-ons?  Does the Addons Manager show a category that lists <strong>Legacy</strong> extensions? <em>IOW, those that aren't compatible with Quantum.</em> </p><p>Knowing that may help us determine if you have a new Profile, and how you should proceed fixing your issue. </p>"

The technician put my files on a new laptop. I then downloaded Firefox onto the new laptop. I tried to login to my account, but it didnât accept my last known password. The system forced me to create a new account and wiped out all of my information. Now that I can get into the system, I see that a recovery key can be created in case the password is forgotten. I donât recall creating a recovery key before, but the system never asked me for one. It just made me create a whole new account and lose everything. Anyway, in the recovered data, there is a file called âOld Firefox Dataâ from 8/11/16 although strangely the file says last modified 4/15/17. Iâm not sure what any of this means, but is there a way that I can restore at least some of my old bookmarks and information from this file? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1246660;,powdrpf325,"id:1246660,created:2019-08-25 11:44:22 -0800,updated:2019-08-25 11:44:22 -0800,creator:Chris_Ilias,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi powdrpf325, In your recovered data, your Firefox user data is stored in the Windows Application Data folder.  </p> <ol><li> For instructions on how to find your data, read the following article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Profiles - Where Firefox stores your bookmarks, passwords and other user data</a> </li><li> Once you have found the data, use the instructions in the following article to recover that data: <a href=""/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">Recovering important data from an old profile</a> </li></ol> <p>The <em>Old Firefox Data</em> folder is created when you perform a refresh of Firefox.

Trouble is I am now paranoid of ever shutting down my computer again. So am going to do manual HTML back up to a thumb drive.

More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>. </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, try either: </p> <ul><li> right-click (on Mac Ctrl+click) a blank area of the page and choose View Page Info &gt; Security &gt; ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" </li><li> (menu bar) Tools &gt; Page Info &gt; Security &gt; ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" </li><li> click the padlock or ""i"" icon in the address bar, then the ""&gt;"" button, then More Information, and finally the ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button </li></ul> <p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

Currently, to my limited knowledge, if a particular entry in the browsing-history is deleted, then all instances of that web-page are deleted from historyÂ ; e.g. if I visited a certain web-page of YouTube on 1st Jan, then again on 20th Jan, and then on 30th Mar, but wished to remove the last entry - I would right-click that entry in the ""Library window"" and select ""delete"" and that would result in all of the three visits getting wiped out. I am sure the features of ""most recent visit"" &amp; ""number of visits"" are useful for many but like I explained before, combining all entries in one creates a bigger problem of hampering the flow of recording one's activities (even if it helps reduce RAM usage).  Currently, this is one of the main problems that I face while using Firefox (for over a year) and always forces me to go back to Chrome (where extensions exist to properly manage history, but are not available for Firefox because of fundamental differences in both programs, while the current Firefox add-ons regarding history are all useless).

It's undoubtedly Firefox built in security devices that are causing this block. Chrome does not cause this, but there are other reasons not to use Chrome unless I have to, which is what I now have to do because of Firefox hyper-intrusive ""security"" software.

I use Altiris (Symantec Management Agent) to deploy Firefox. I keep having a problem where Altiris will have the updated version of Firefox, and then a minor update to Firefox is released and it breaks Firefox.  Like right now we have 68.0.1 packaged, and 68.0.2 just came out and Firefox automatically updates to that. Firefox won't work when Altiris installs 68.0.1 because of the detection check looking to see if Firefox 68.0.1 is installed, but it doesn't so it installs 68.0.1. Firefox then says that I'm using an old version and need to make a new profile and I lose my bookmarks, internet history, and logins.

Hint:  Spend more time outside and that bloated face will trim down so girls will actually find you interesting and appealing.  You're Korean, you have some of the best athletic genetics on the planet.  In every field that Koreans focus on they dominate athletically.  Its evident everywhere Koreans are in the world.  You'll get results very fast if you put in the effort.  Its worth it.  Its called fast twitch muscle response and both blacks and Koreans are about the best in the world.  This ability helps all athletics, not just dancing where they already dominate the world.  Learn about pure food, fasting and fitness and you'll be a new person in a few months.  Nobody will recognize you.  That control over your own body is very empowering.  It will spread to all facets of your life.

Consequently, the authentication window stays open for ever with nothing happening. I have already alerted my MasterCard issuer, a major retail business, in the hope that their complaint to Mozilla will carry more weight than mine.

Last night it seemed to work fine. however, this morning when I got online there was another update.  Apparently a 69.0 build.  </p><p>I read the notes. something about some new kind of monitoring for tracking. However, when I updated to the new build, the very same problem started happening again with the ""Send email"" function. Consequently, I did a restore, which would or should have put me back to yesterday's update. </p><p>however, after the restore, Firefox rendered as all black, or blank. it would not recognize my home page or any of the links on the New Tab page. The address's would not even appear in the address bar. </p><p>I was at a complete loss, and sort of migrating all my information to IE or Chrome, I did a second restore. I have the visuals on my browser back, but the Send Email link isn't working properly, again. </p><p>That said, I have to say the new build didn't fix my problem, in fact it made things worse. I am now going to restore it back to the build before the update that caused me the problem with the send link function.  </p><p>But yes, the 69 build made the problem worse in that for some reason it wasn't rendering anything.

Maybe it's all been a matter of timing, but all I can say, with the current Windows/Office updates installed, I keep having this, random, conflict with the updated version of Firefox. I did reinstall them again and tried disabling my Anti-Virus (AVG 2019) I even made sure the AVG was up to date, and, somewhat ironically, it took an update as well, but when i have it disable, I consistently get the error, when it is enabled, I only get it randomly. Nevertheless, with the new update to Firefox install, I am having the conflict. So I did another restore, and everything works fine when the latest Firefox update isn't installed. I'm willing to try any suggestions, but until then I'll not install the Firefox update because frankly, it's just annoying. when the Send Email can't make up it's mind where to focus. I obviously perform this function a lot, but I use it as alternative to bookmarking. I can find the email quicker than I can the bookmark and they're very random.

You can set them to be sticky and not close when you click somewhere, but this can be very annoying in its own way... let me know if you want to test that. </p><p>If the content of the panel/popup is blank/distorted, it could signal an incompatibility between Firefox and your graphics card/chipset driver software. For that last issue, one method of diagnosis is to temporarily disable Firefox from using hardware acceleration. This article describes where to make that change: <a href=""/en-US/kb/performance-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox's performance settings</a>. This will take effect the next time you exit Firefox and start it up again.

1266862,2019-08-16 12:35:03 -0800,2019-10-30T16:04:08Z,Need help on reducing bookmarks line spacing,"<p>Hi, </p><p>First of all, I would like to say that I am a Firefox user since 2007 (since we are in 2019, that's 12 years). I like it and I thank all the Firefox people that worked on it. </p><p>However, about two weeks ago I have updated my system from Debian 8 to Debian 10; and with it came a new version of Firefox. </p><p>And I don't like the way this new Firefox version looks: - it's ugly  - it has out of proportion line spacing in the bookmarks - it has out of proportion line spacing in the Preferences menus - it is much less visual appealing than previous versions </p><p>Nevertheless, under the hood, I don't doubt that it is more advanced and better. </p><p>I just think it's a wrong move from the people leading Firefox at the moment. Maybe they believe they have to follow the (stupid) trend that many other software houses are following:  - non intuitive icons - poor use of colors - exagerated simplifying in icons design - minimalistic screen organization - menus with less options, forcing the users to edit configuration files </p><p>All this leads to the user having to ""try and guess"", trying to discover how things work. 20 or 10 years ago, the softwares weren't so advanced, but they were more organized and with better menus. Today, if seems the need is to build something beautiful. But that beauty soon loses it charm after 5 minutes of interaction. </p><p>This is the sensation I get from interacting with Firefox nowadays. And it extends to the support forum, with lack of tast in the design, colors, etc. Too many steps back, in my opinion. </p><p>Using Firefox now is not as good an experience like it was some years ago. We need something that works, that has good menus, that we like to see. And not being forced to like something that others think it's the present trend. Firefox is used for the internet, so it needs to be a very good tool. Stop fooling around with it, please. </p><p>Also, when I try to solve this problem using themes, I'm stumped because I find some many themes. But the problem is that they are poor quality themes. Much quantity, but poor quality. And the search function, is horrible to say the least. </p><p>Besides, I don't understand that Firefox now calls themes to simply adding an image to the menu bar. Is that really a theme? Is this really a good service? I don't think so. I think this is dumb. And steers users away. </p><p>I don't care for flowers or manga characters in my menu bar. I just want well designed folder icons and line spacing that makes sense. </p><p>Why doesn't Firefox gives the user the choice of using the previous themes? Aren't we in 2019?

Just change ""margin-top: 0pxÂ !important;"" to increase by some pixels to fine tune it to your liking.  Thank you also to Firefox people that make this great browser.

The only way to get out of this is to click the x to close, and then it says ""Firefox not responding, Close or Wait for program to respond.""  If I wait nothing happens and program never responds.

The reason this is happening is that when I click to navigate to the next page from the previous page, I have to scroll all the way to the bottom in order to click to get to the Concur Expense Reporting page, so the scroll bar isn't smart enough to go all the way back up when it's on the Concur Expense Reporting page.  Any way to fix this?

Instead, you can use a proxy or ""man in the middle"" which accepts a more secure connection from Firefox and then makes a less secure connection to your device.

Does Firefox have a list of approved trackers that are allowed to track because of a commitment not to track? It sounds a bit like a contradiction. </p><p>I think Mozilla's emphasis is on blocking of known trackers through the Content Blocking feature. If you have Tracking Protection enabled, Firefox also will sent a DNT signal indicating that you prefer not to be tracked. It's hard to think of a case where you would want to not send that signal if Tracking Protection is enabled. Or how those would work together. </p> <blockquote> 2) Would I want my browser to unblock 3rd parties? </blockquote> <p>Sounds like a question you are in the best position to answer.Â ;-) </p> <blockquote> 3) if your answer to Q2 is yes, then how do I do that? </blockquote> <p>To manage Content Blocking, see: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>.  </p> <blockquote> 4) Do I want my browser to protect from finger printing?  </blockquote> <p>In a perfect world, yes. </p> <blockquote> 5) if your answer is yes to Q3, then how do I instruct my browser to do so? </blockquote> <p>(Q4, I assume) Firefox has a feature to block known sources of fingerprinting scripts.

Things mostly work, but sometimes they don't. The things that don't work seem to be buttons and menus. I run Firefox on Linux; today I'm on Fedora 28 with Firefox 66.0.4, but my issues seem to transcend time- probably 8 years or more. But Chrome scares me, so maybe we can address this and get it figured out. </p><p>I'll include some specifics to get down to the details of why Firefox fails. Here's a website that I just went to: <a href=""https://lcsc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lcsc.com/</a> . After you get there, a New Coupon windows pops up. Apparently ""Coupon in Your Pocket"" is a button, but nothing happens when I click on it. </p><p>I've been having problems at Aliexpress, too, where it asks me to login but I can't because the login button is unresponsive. But let's not try to fix Aliexpress, perhaps it would be better to focus on the one website so we don't get distracted.

It looks like a book, or an HTML page split into two frames, whatever. </p><p>2) Expand the ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" dropdown. On my pc It's a folder with a big star on it. I suppose because it's important. Who knows. </p><p>3) The set of bookmarks and folders that dropped down when you expanded the folder should be the same as your old firefox bookmarks toolbar. Highlight them all by left clicking on the first one, holding down shift, and clicking on the last one. </p><p>4) Once these are highlighted, just drag and drop them to your bookmarks toolbar. </p><p>Firefox should really explain this on their FAQ / instructions for importing bookmarks.

1266673,2019-08-13 18:24:51 -0800,2019-08-14T15:21:20Z,Poor multi-tab user responsivness is caused by primitive FF multi-tasking/ threading.,"<p>Could this note be referred please, to the FF programming manager?  First my congrats on FF overall of course, to you and your many volunteers.  But I notice a large philosophical programming problem which you might consider. </p><p>This problem mostly shows with multiple tabs open.  Web servers certainly are slow, and many pages' Html etc poor.  This all results in lots of delays such as reported during: </p><pre> Waiting for ()  Read ()  Transferring data from ()  Performing a TLS handshake to ()  Connecting to () </pre> <p>These display the moving ""working"" dot in the left of the affected tab title.  And less often, ""(not responding)"" in FF's title bar, which eventually gets cleared automatically. </p><p>I have reviewed all 17 screens, and a number of the individual results, from today's FF forum search of: </p><pre>  169 results for (not responding) for Firefox </pre> <p>None address the lack of prioritized co-operative multi-tasking/ threading, DURING such delays as ""Waiting for ()"".  During such a necessary wait, it is very slow at best, e.g. for a user to switch tabs.  Even to one which is ready for display. </p><p>Responsiveness to user input should be the top multi-tasking priority.  Tab switching.  Rendering/ display of the foreground tab.  Scrolling that down.  Tab closing by user!, and ""X"" to STOP a page from loading -- give those user clicks priority.  Let's not have to wait 10 seconds for a right-click to open its option box.  Let the other busy tabs finish up their work, overlapped in the background priority-wise. </p><p>This could be done now, but perhaps it would be difficult for volunteer programmers.  Worse case might require a custom replacement, for the effective TCP part of the default vanilla TCP/IP stack.  However I suspect a lot could be fixed short of that, with the correct management encouragement and guidelines.  At least if the continuous motion of the ""busy dot"" indicator in the tab title is a task, just change that to something like just gray-ed out while busy. </p><p>My experience is with much headroom:  CPU (50%), memory, disk, and network bandwidth, per Task Manager.  NO McAfee.  Mainly just ZoneAlarm taking 30% of that CPU 50% usage.  This is not a problem with start-up delay.  And delays within only one open tab are necessary, of course.  Cheers </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;windows-10;bug_1;firefox-680;firefox-6801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1244123;1244127;1244130;1244313;,gp456a,"id:1244313,created:2019-08-14 15:21:20 -0800,updated:2019-08-14 15:21:20 -0800,creator:gp456a,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you. Cor-el -- many good single-tab suggestions, perhaps of value to other readers.  And improving single-tab performance certainly reduces the impact of multi-tab problems. </p><p>I have pursued all those pertinent suggestions myself, either previously or just now, and will retain them for future re-reviews.   In fact my ZoneAlarm firewall using even 30% of CPU was a clue.  My refreshing its data-table reference to FireFox, after the latest update to 68.0.2 at least, helped me. </p><p>The pages/ servers demonstrating the multi-tab stickiness I see are behind private login, so I'm sorry I can't refer you directly.  If I notice a public example, I will.  Picture each page, which self-indulgently refers to 35+ other servers.  At least one of which servers is usually very slow.  Not FF's problem directly, single-tab.  FF certainly abides, until done finally.  But even Windows occasionally notices FF's ""(not responding)"". </p><p>And I notice, slow UI response attempting another tab.  If it was my responsibility, I would set up a test server which could be artificially handicapped.   However I'll leave that to the FF programmers.

How-to can I disable the policy for My Personal FireFox ? ?,"<p>I usually use and update my PortableApps version of FireFox, that runs from my Thumb/Flash drive, at the Public Library network's workstation due to my use of their facilities for research.   The Library uses this same version of FireFox on each of their workstation, too.  About three weeks ago, PortableApps indicated that FireFox had an Update to version 68 ready for my copy of FireFox to use.  I accepted to update My Personal copy of FireFox to this version while using the Library's workstation running Windows 7.   Now when I startup my personal copy of FFox from my PortableApps Flash drive, I immediately noticed that INSTEAD of showing the Home page that I had chosen many years ago and was still using, it had changed to the Library's selected Starting Webpage, as if I was starting FFox or Chrome from THEIR installed software ON this workstation (please see -- the attachment showing the Grayed-out selection about the Home Page).   I have contacted PortableApps via IRC and they confirmed that they do not effect the installation of FFox other than install upon the logically identified drive as the target device.  They felt that there was some background process running and this process might have applied an Enterprise Policy file to this installation process.  They then suggested contacting Mozilla's support.  I would like to properly address this change and also see what other preferences may have been affected.  I have posted this Question due to having been hurt by using a Generic solution (in the Past) described for a similar but not the same issue (i.e. How to Disable the Enterprise Roots Preference).   Reading a bit further, there seems to be two methods of accomplishing this type of control (MS's - Group Policy -or- a policy.json file).   In the meantime, I thought that I would seek Mozilla's Support more specific advise and help.   I find this VERY annoying considering, I am using my personal version of software and they Only recently ( after using their network for years ) affected my copy without ANY notice posted on their network of this type of change for my consideration.   My benefit to the use of a my personal copy is to be able to save found sites to My - Bookmarks/Favorites.  Otherwise I would not have this ability, but with notices, I would have found either other public networks or methods to have this functionality years ago.  </p><p>I hope that someone may have a better process of figuring out how and what to do to in these types of situations.  Also what would be the best way to protect an otherwise operating Browser - Say backing up, WhatÂ ! ? Prior to making changesÂ ?

It did not do this previously.   </p><p>I then also notice that I finally, this time, had the request to fill-in the information for the Crash Reporter and I click the button to close FFoxÂ !

There is a brief delay before Firefox shows the ""title"" associated with hovered text, and it should be shown below the mouse pointer to avoid blocking the hovered text.  </p><p>I'm not aware of any built-in setting to turn this off. Add-ons could remove title's from a page but I haven't searched for one. </p><p>(2) Mouseover script </p><p>The page author might have attached a mouseover script to a range of characters to trigger the display of a custom tooltip. Sites usually do this to show richer and more formatted text/images than Firefox allows with the title attribute. Your screenshot doesn't seem to fit the pattern. </p><p>I'm not aware of any built-in setting to disable mouseover scripts. Add-ons could remove mouseover handlers from a page but I haven't searched for one. </p><p>(3) Generated content </p><p>The page author might have attached a custom style rule for when you hover a range of characters to trigger the display of generated text. There isn't a good reason to use this more complex method where the title attribute would work equally well, so I doubt this is the explanation. </p><p>I'm not aware of any built-in setting to disable generated content. Add-ons probably could hide hover-triggered generated content in a page but I haven't searched for one. </p><p><em>Note:</em> Firefox normally displays the URL of links in the lower left corner of the browser, sometimes the lower right corner. This should not float up over the main part of the page.  </p> <blockquote> I tried <em>browser.chrome.toolbar_tips</em> but it doesnât work.  </blockquote> <p>Preferences that contain the word ""chrome"" generally refer to the user interface area. So that one might be for toolbar button tooltips. </p>"

Unfortunately, I have no opportunity to show the problem statement (it was made orally), but I will try to describe the problem in more detail. It is as follows. There is a hardware and software complex (in an isolated local area network), it is based on the Mozilla Firefox browser using HTML, JS, PHP. The user navigates from page to page, clicks buttons, enters information into dialog boxes, performs search queries - everything is quite trivial. To conduct debugging, eliminate errors in program codes, fix the logic of the program, there is a need to maintain (log) a list of program events that occurred during the user's work (switching focus between DOM elements, pressing the mouse button, entering data into input fields, and so on) and a list of JS-functions performed from JS-scripts that are included in the code of the web page. As a result of the oral discussion, it was decided to implement these tasks using the extension for Mozilla Firefox (for example, *.xpi). My task is either to implement it, or to prove that it is impossible, and offer another solution. In the field of web-programming I am a beginner, so to speak, how to solve this problem, it is difficult for me. Looking for information, but currently I have not found a solution.

I also use Cookie 5 for management of cookies and noticed it was not deleting Firefox cookies, but still worked with other browsers. I worked with <a href=""http://sweetpproductions.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sweetpproductions.com</a> to see if Cookie 5 had an issue but nothing found. Essentially, if I wipe out Firefox entirely ( I went as far as creating a new Firefox Sync account) things work for a while. Problems start to show up in this order: 1. No suggestions from my history when typing in the address bar 2. Old bookmarks show up, ones that have not existed in the new Sync account (I did, however restore my bookmarks from a clone of my SSD made a couple of weeks ago, so they may have been somewhere in there) 3. Cannot delete these old bookmarks 4. Export bookmarks to html creates a file with only folder titles, no links at all (I tried this to see if I could edit out the unwanted bookmarks there and re-import) 5. Export bookmarks to html fails altogether; no file is written 6. Cookie stops being able to read and delete Firefox cookies. The new cookies arrive, can be seen in my Privacy prefs, but don't show in Cookie 5. </p><p>Most of this sounds like places.sqlite is becoming corrupted. I don't think that is affected by Cookie 5, as I understand it stores only history and bookmarks. I'm waiting to hear from SweetP to confirm Cookie 5 doesn't touch places.sqlite. I suppose I must try to confirm this by starting over again and keeping a copy of places.sqlite when it is fresh, then using it to replace the file in my profile when the problems start.

Every time I fix it it recurs again a month or two later.  I have read every article online that matches, followed all advice and still the problem comes back.  This time I can't even fix it: </p><p>It starts with Firefox preventing Macbook Pro from shutting down (OS 10.11.6 - late 2011 model). It won't force quit I have cleared the library and the cache. I have uninstalled and removed the whole Firefox folder from Library/APplication Support. The macbook then shuts down properly. I have re-installed firefox.   BUT without even opening Firefox just putting it in the applications folder, the mac now won't shutdown - the desktop and top menu bar disappear and the wallpaper just hangs. I have run Malwarebytes to see if I have some malware issue - but it's come up clean. </p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received!

1266485,2019-08-10 21:06:14 -0800,2019-08-10T22:20:52Z,Firefox slow to start and responding to shortcuts,"<p>Hello, This issue started a month or two ago. Previously, Firefox takes about 1 second to start. The next day, starting my computer, Firefox consistently takes about 5-10 seconds to start. Not only this, but it also takes 5-10 seconds for an already running Firefox to respond to links from external programs (e.g. Adobe Acrobat, Word), as well as opening a second Firefox window by clicking on the Firefox shortcut. Interestingly, everything is fast and smooth with normal browsing and opening a new window via Firefox Ctrl+N is fine. Other browsers and software have no issues (e.g. Chrome). This has been really frustrating as I'm heavily reliant on Firefox and I have tried the following methods to no avail: </p><p>â¢ Disabling all add-ons / Start Firefox in Safe Mode â¢ Reinstalling Firefox with fresh / no profiles. â¢ Disabling anti-virus software (ESET Internet Security) â¢ Uninstalling anti-virus software â¢ Flushing DNS and resetting adapter â¢ [WORKED] Starting Windows in Safe Mode â¢ Disabling start-up services and processes systematically without Windows Safe Mode [Firefox slow again] â¢ Disabling all services [still slow] â¢ [WORKED for a few days...] Clean reinstalling WINDOWS â¢ [WORKED for a few days...] System Restore (in between restore points I did almost nothing to PC, did not install any new programs, etc.) </p><p>Sounds like a software issue, but if you want specs: Intel 7700K, 16GB 3000MHz RAM, Z270, Nvidia 980 Ti, Crucial M500 SSD. </p><p>What are your thoughts? To me, it seems like something that run in normal Windows mode is slowing Firefox to start. Possibly conflicting apps? But I couldn't figure out which. Obviously, I can't run Windows in Safe mode all the time, so I was wondering if you have a solution? </p><p>Many thanks Cam </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-680;firefox-6801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1243556;1243557;1243561;1243562;,colinbox,"id:1243562,created:2019-08-10 22:20:52 -0800,updated:2019-08-10 22:20:52 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>To let you in on my thoughts: This issue with Threadripper: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1266384"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox black-screens my PC</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/performance-settings?as=u&amp;utm_source=inproduct"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox's performance settings</a> </p> id:1243561,created:2019-08-10 22:12:38 -0800,updated:2019-08-10 22:12:38 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi, I'm seeing a lot of different issues regarding your Nvidia 980 Ti.

The old process must be closed to open a new window"" error to pop p, with the options ""Close Process"" and ""Cancel"". Clicking either button caused the error message to become unresponsive, and after a few minutes a second identical error would pop up (without the original one ever closing); sometimes when there were several unresponsive errors it would sometimes crash Windows Explorer if I tried to interact with new popups. In Task manager there were multiple Firefox processes running, but attempting to ""End Process"" would not end two of them, they simply stayed there active. By this point I'd resolved all other issues from the PC crash, as far as I could see, and no other programs were showing any issues at all. </p><p>I restarted the PC several times but the error persisted; I was able to create a new profile in Profile Manager but this did not stop the error. I uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted the parent.lock files in the Appdata/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles folder (they were 'in use by Firefox' if I didn't uninstall and restart the PC first, even though no Firefox processes were listed as running in Task Manager). I then reinstalled Firefox, but I still got the same error popup (though it at least didn't become unresponsive and crash Windows Explorer any more - but I still have the un-ending processes in Task Manager). </p><p>By this point I've (after backing them up!) uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Roaming folder, everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Local folder, and under Program Files (X86), then reinstalled Firefox again. The error persists, unchanged. </p><p>Any further suggestions on what I could try would be welcome, I'm stumped by this. Chrome and Avast Browser work fine; Internet Explorer works about as well as it ever does. No new programs had been installed around the time of the problem (to my knowledge) and I've been using Firefox for years on this PC. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1243347;1243500;,jamesdcoleman,"id:1243500,created:2019-08-10 14:52:59 -0800,updated:2019-08-10 14:52:59 -0800,creator:jamesdcoleman,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Many thanks; I tried most of the above in my original attempts to fix it but I've tried again, deleting all remaining files after uninstalling (and backing up profile data, of course) so nothing remains from the previous Firefox install, restarting, and reinstalling.

Firefox normally shows touch support enabled when the user has a touch screen. There is a preference or two to disable touch event support (first screenshot), and when you switch those, the touch feature stops working. However, Modernizr uses three methods to check for touch event support and Firefox only changes the result for those of those (second screenshot). So this makes the problem worse because now the site thinks touch works and it doesn't work any more. Therefore, I don't suggest changing this setting. </p> id:1243620,created:2019-08-11 04:39:15 -0800,updated:2019-08-11 04:39:15 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Here are two screenshots,  showing the slideshow with left-right arrow buttons  (and I also pulled up the images at the bottom)  in Edge, and the same page in Firefox  (note the button at the bottom right,  where the little hand prompted me to slide using my touchscreen)Â : </p> id:1243604,created:2019-08-11 03:08:45 -0800,updated:2019-08-11 03:08:45 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>ute.buse <a href=""#answer-1243423"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> This website apparently uses a scroll-linked positioning effect.

However the Intermediate1 cert (SpaceSSL CA) is not in the Firefox default trusted CA store, and consequently flags a problem when connecting to this website. </p><p>From a usability perspective it is not feasible for users to manually install the untrusted CA intermediate cert into Firefox (although this overcomes the connectivity issues if manually imported to the FF store). </p><p>Therefore I was wondering whether if the website server supplies the full cert chain file to Firefox whether Firefox will use that to 'bypass' the lack of trust of the SpaceSSL certificate or whether the same trust issues will remain (since SpaceSSL CA is not in the trusted store of FF). </p><p>Many thanks for the help. </p><p>Paul </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-660;,firefox,websites,en-US,1243014;1243026;1243033;1243035;,paul46,"id:1243035,created:2019-08-08 08:12:45 -0800,updated:2019-08-08 08:12:45 -0800,creator:paul46,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Great.

Firefox often has not seen an intermediate cert before, but it can be trusted as long as it was validly signed and can be verified up to a trusted root certificate. After verification, it will be cached and show up in the Certificate Manager dialog, Authorities tab, with the designation ""Software Security Device"" (instead of ""Builtin Object Token""). </p><p>The server doesn't need to send the root certificate that is already included with browsers, and probably shouldn't. I think the SSL Labs test views that as a configuration error. Your bundle only needs to include the intermediate certs. Your certificate issuer should tell you which ones you need to serve. </p> id:1243026,created:2019-08-08 07:57:19 -0800,updated:2019-08-08 07:57:19 -0800,creator:paul46,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks very much @jscher2000.  </p><p>Just to clarify my understanding.

Lately while listening to music, sound gets choppy when using FF.  Not on other browsers.  So, uninstalled FF completely, then clean installed ver 68.  New problem, when I launch FF, there's a 10 sec delay to get to my homepage, google.  Wasn't like that before.  So, I disabled my vpn, and that fixed it. VPN didn't have any effect , good or bad, on 67.   I tried edge, and it's fine, only FF 68 has the startup problem.  So, uninstalled 68, clean installed 67 to get rid of vpn effect.  Now it upgraded me to 68 and I have no problems with startup..... The choppy sound problem is back.  Choppy when launching or going from page to page, but not while just reading an article.

I am not sure if this is a Google of a Firefox problem. In this past week there has been a new information frame appear. Before when one clicked on an image it would be highlighted amid the search grid with some associated information (original site, image size etc). Now this pops out as a separate panel to the right of my browser screem. Due to the quick way I need to work, this is cumbersome and annoying. </p><p>Also if I right clicked and opened an image in a new tab, it would open with the image filling two-thirds of the screen on the left, which gave a decent view of it. On the right hand panel would be the information about site, title, caption etc. Now all of this is squished into a portrait sized panel that looks as though it has been designed for a tablet or phone. It also means with each image I am having to conduct an additional action to right click to expand to full size so I can actually get a decent view of what it is because it has been so squished down to only medium size by all the other data. </p><p>My question is this. Up until a few days ago this panel was not there. It would occasionally appear sometimes, especially if I was logged into a Google account but mostly not and would be gone next time I searched. From my investigation of this it is something that appears with some browsers and not others. If this is something that does/doesn't appear in Firefox, how do i make it go away? </p><p>My question is is how do I make this pop-up panel go away and just get the regular old image highlight? Much easier and less messing around to use, not to mention actually offered a better and clearer view of what the image actually was. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;google;firefox-680;,firefox,websites,en-US,1242906;,Lover_of_Goats,"id:1242906,created:2019-08-07 15:52:30 -0800,updated:2019-08-07 15:52:30 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Google appears to have changed the interface for image search results. You should see the popup on the right side of the screen. This is the intended behaviour. It should look something like the attached screenshot. </p><p>It's a fairly new change, so maybe Google hasn't rolled out the change to everyone yet. This may be why it's not always appearing on all of your devices. </p><p>If the window is not displaying properly, it could be something to do with your zoom level. Try pressing <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>0</strong> (Zero) to reset the zoom level back to 100%. If you are on a smaller screen, perhaps zooming the back out may help. See <a href=""/en-US/kb/font-size-and-zoom-increase-size-of-web-pages"" rel=""nofollow"">Font size and zoom - increase the size of web pages</a> for more information. </p><p>As for bringing back the search results page you used previously, it's likely not possible. When a website releases a change, you're pretty much stuck with the change. </p><p>If it helps, once the panel is open the left and right side of the screen scroll independently of each other. So you could open the panel and still screen through the images on the left side without having to constantly close and open the panel. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Just had to accept it was gone to get done with my tasks the coming weeks.  Sorry, long story.  The problem: It happened again now, but I succesfully restored the session from sessionstore-backups with the .jsonlz4 file.  Question is: I would like to restore last years session too. In the sessionstore-backups folder I can only find files from a month back. Is it ANY way to restore/find the URLs in the active tabs, from last year. I know it's a long shot, but it was VERY important to me!

You can export interesting files to a convenient location such as your currently live desktop.

But I'll speculate anyway.  </p><p>Firefox 68 has a new launch(er) process that seems to affect some helper programs. When a user is running with admin privileges, the launcher process in Firefox 68 now runs the browser with only standard user privileges (medium integrity) instead of full admin privileges (high integrity). When you open a download from the Downloads list, the helper application seems to inherit the reduced privileges under which Firefox is running, and that can have unexpected side effects.  </p><p><em><strong>Workaround?</strong></em> </p><p>If that is the problem, there is a workaround to force Firefox to run with full user privileges. Whether you decide to do this depends on how much of an inconvenience this is for your user versus the security benefits of the browser being able to do less damage to the system if it becomes compromised.  </p><p>You could test it to see whether my theory is the explanation. If not, it must be something else. </p><p><em>Here's how:</em> </p><p>The simplest method would be to modify your Firefox program shortcut (assuming you start Firefox from the program shortcut, and not from a link). Either: </p> <ul><li> Right-click a Firefox desktop shortcut, then click Properties </li><li> Right-click a Firefox icon pinned to the Taskbar then right-click Mozilla Firefox, then click Properties </li></ul> <p>Windows should show the Shortcut tab and select the Target field. The Target usually is along the following lines: </p> <ul><li> ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" </li><li> ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" </li></ul> <p>You would add a space and then the new switch, either: </p> <ul><li> ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -no-deelevate </li><li> ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -no-deelevate </li></ul> <p>This will take effect the next time you exit out of Firefox and start it up again using the shortcut.

Firefox 68 enabled a new feature called WebRender, so since it is graphics related, perhaps another workaround would be to disable only WebRender.  These are the related preferences, but I can't test it myself (WebRender isn't enabled on laptops, it seems):  (1) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful or accepting the risk.  (2) In the search box above the list, type or paste <strong>webren</strong> and pause while the list is filtered  <em>Near the bottom:</em>  (3) If the <strong>gfx.webrender.enabled</strong> preference is true, double-click it to toggle it to false  (4) Double-click the <strong>gfx.webrender.force-disabled</strong> preference to switch the value from false to true  Meanwhile, re-enable hardware acceleration on the Options page, then exit and restart Firefox.

But no, pdfs download directly, therefore txt and html should do likewise. </p><p>It was kind of you to investigate the possibility of modifying firefox's behavior via external scripts, but I think that would be an option more laborious than simply living with the status quo.

I took a look at the simplest type of modification, which is to add the <strong>download</strong> attribute to the link to pop up a download dialog. </p><p>Adding the download attribute to the plain text link on the /ebooks/ page does not work: </p><p>&lt;a href=""//www.gutenberg<em>.</em>org/ebooks/19073.txt.utf-8"" type=""text/plain"" class=""link"" title=""Download"" <strong>download=""cocoa.txt""</strong>&gt;Plain Text UTF-8&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>I think it's because there is a redirect from https to http, and that may be violating the ""same-origin"" restriction on the download attribute. </p><p>Perhaps that is why this also does not work: </p><p>&lt;a href=""http://www.gutenberg<em>.</em>org/ebooks/19073.txt.utf-8"" type=""text/plain"" class=""link"" title=""Download"" download=""cocoa.txt""&gt;Plain Text UTF-8&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>If I change the URL to the ultimate destination under /cache/ using a relative URL so it is HTTPS, that works, but this information about the ultimate URL is not readily available to a script in the page: </p><p>&lt;a href=""/cache/epub/19073/pg19073.txt"" type=""text/plain"" class=""link"" title=""Download"" download=""cocoa.txt""&gt;Plain Text UTF-8&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>If I click More Files... and look at the /files/ list, it seems we do not have to worry about a redirect. However, we also cannot see the book title here to construct a nice file name.  </p><p>So /files/ isn't a good page to modify, but it gives us a better understanding of additional paths to the files on the server. If we can determine the pattern, we can inject a new link/button in the /ebooks/ page that has the exact behavior we want.  </p><p>A fun project for someone.

1266098,2019-08-04 09:20:27 -0800,2019-08-07T01:27:24Z,Still Not Working!,"<p>I gave up on Firefox due to its insistence that I could not stop it forcing updates on me no matter what settings I used in options as well as about: . I went back to IE9. Yes 9, as Microsoft couldn't repair Windows 7 to get a later version installed. Anyhow, after my motherboard became erratic and the replacement meant Win 7 no longer worked at all, I decided it was time to 'upgrade' to Win 10. After a complete reinstall of my software from scratch I realised just how bad Edge is and thought I might see how Firefox was holding up. I thought the sync could be useful and was getting on with it until 68.0.1! Since updating to this version automatically (the settings in options still do not work), it appears it is updating/resetting itself after every reboot. It restores the defaults and behaves as if it has just updated each time. Also after doing this for five times it appears to have broken ADBlock which advises it cannot work any more. I have had to uninstall it to get the tab to stop. So, as my questions were never answered previously, I'll ask again: 1. How do I get Firefox to stop updating itself? Options 'check for updates but let you choose when to install them' clearly still doesn't work as it updates regardless. 2. How do I get to keep my preferences. Having to go through them all each time Firefox updates is a pain. Surely it cannot be too much to create an ini file? 3. How do I convince Firefox not to keep installing version 68.0.1 over itself? 4. As Adblock no longer works in this version (I'm sure they are pleased with this result), what good alternatives are there? </p>",desktop;other;profile;dataloss;firefox-680;,firefox,other,en-US,1242690;1242717;1242719;1242720;1242721;1242773;,AnnieBody,"id:1242773,created:2019-08-07 01:27:24 -0800,updated:2019-08-07 01:27:24 -0800,creator:AnnieBody,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks to all that responded.

Why is that?,"<p>Four or five months ago, I saw the Content Blocking shield icon in my Firefox browser.  When I clicked on it, there was no option to disable Content Blocking.  Then I realized that I probably had to create a Mozilla account.  Did that, and suddenly the option was there to disable content blocking.  Today I was at the MSN website - which has been crashing my video driver lately, and I thought that perhaps if I shut off content blocking it would help.  Lo and behold there is no more shield icon but there is an information icon which contains content blocking info (it is an i inside a circle).  Once again there is no 'disable content blocking for this site' option.  What gives?  How can I get the shield icon and the disable option back??  I currently use Firefox version 68.0.1 (64 bit)   </p><p>Update:  I have noticed that this problem happens only when I am at the MSN website.   Thank you for any advice you can provide. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-680;,firefox,other,en-US,1242239;1242249;1242271;1242272;1242273;1242275;1242276;1242279;1242288;1242290;1242293;1242296;1242381;1242583;,lamoureuxp,"id:1242583,created:2019-08-06 08:18:56 -0800,updated:2019-08-06 08:18:56 -0800,creator:JeremySanders,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Archived. </p> id:1242381,created:2019-08-05 05:52:24 -0800,updated:2019-08-05 05:52:24 -0800,creator:lamoureuxp,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>That is already selected - see attached.

With each new request to the site, Firefox includes the cookies so the site knows it is you and not someone else. If your cookies get cleared, either by a built-in setting, an add-on, or an external cleaning program, then this method of staying logged in won't work and you have to start again. </p><p>Some sites (like search engines) use cookies to save preferences, so if you need to reset those each time, losing your cookies seems like the most likely reason. </p><p><em>More comments below the line</em> </p><p>(B) Fill the Login Form </p><p>Firefox's password manager and add-on password managers can fill login forms automatically for you. If you let Firefox save your login, this may have stopped working normally. </p> <hr> <p><em><strong>Why are cookies gone in my next session?</strong></em> </p><p><strong>(1) If you are visiting the site in a private window</strong> </p><p>Cookies are not written to disk in private windows, so whether they are session cookies or have an expiration date after we're all gone, they will evaporate when the last private window is closed in your session. </p><p>The two ways a site could open in a private window are: </p><p>(A) Creating a private window in a regular session (for example, Ctrl+Shift+p or right-click &gt; Open Link in New Private Window) </p><p>(B) Setting Firefox to use automatic private browsing on the Options/Preferences page -- </p> <ul><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it </li></ul> <p>In the left column, click <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, then scroll down to the <strong>History</strong> section. Either of these will invoke automatic private browsing: </p> <ul><li> Firefox will: Never remember history </li><li> Firefox will: Use custom settings for history + ""Always use private browsing mode"" </li></ul> <p><strong>(2) If Firefox is set to store ONLY session cookies, and you have not made an exception for the site.</strong> </p><p>You can check for this on the Preferences page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, Cookies section. Make sure you do NOT have a checkmark for ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"". If you do, you need to create ""Allow"" exceptions for sites where you want Firefox to accept persistent cookies. </p><p><img src=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2019-05-01-08-10-39-73a6c7.png"" width=""500""> </p><p><strong>(3) If Firefox is set to Clear History When it Closes and that includes Cookies</strong> </p><p>Most people do not have this setting, but you can double-check here: On the Preferences page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, History section: make sure you do NOT have a checkmark for ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". If you want to use that feature with <em>some</em> types of data, use the Settings button to the right of it to confirm that Cookies are not being cleared. </p><p><strong>(4) If you use an add-on that modifies how cookies work</strong> </p><p>There are extensions to manage cookie lifetimes and removal, including some that expire cookies for inactive tabs. There also are extensions that isolate pages in a container, which creates a separate cookie jar for the pages in that container which are invisible to pages outside that container. </p><p><strong>(5) If you logged out of the site</strong> </p><p>The cookie identifies you to the site, but if your session ended, the site isn't going to start a new one automatically. So if you logged out on the site -- highly recommended for sites that have sensitive data or accounts you can't afford to have taken over -- then the site <em>might</em> pre-fill your user name on the login page, but you will need to sign in again. </p><p><strong>(6) If external utility or privacy software cleans browser cookies</strong> </p><p>If you use CCleaner, Advanced SystemCare or other third party programs that touch browser data, set them not to touch Firefox data. </p><p><strong>(7) If your IP address is unstable</strong> </p><p>Some sites link your identification to your IP address and require a new login if that changes. To minimize the potential for changes, you can check your Firefox connection settings on the Preferences page.  </p><p>In the search box at the top of the page, type <em>proxy</em> and Firefox should filter to the ""Settings"" button, which you can click. </p><p>The default of ""Use system proxy settings"" piggybacks on your system settings (for example, Windows/IE ""LAN"" setting). ""Auto-detect"" can lead to a flaky connection. You may want to try ""No proxy"". </p><p>Does any of that help? </p>"

I cannot update Firefox.  I cannot get any Mozilla approved add-ons to download.   I have tried to connect to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> using all of the Big Three browsers out there and I have the same problem of not being able to connect to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> or any of Mozilla's affiliated websites on any of the browsers.  I am using Windows 10 and currently have the Firefox 68.0.1build.  I have separately ran three different top-tier antivirus programs on my desktop PC and nothing noteworthy was found.  I completely uninstalled the antivirus programs and still no connection to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a>. I tried DNS flush and tried a different DNS server, I tried resetting the modem and router, checked the PC's date and time settings, ensured that no parental controls were enabled, ensured that JavaScript was enabled, removed all Firefox extensions, restarted Firefox in safe mode, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and still have the same problem.  I tried connecting to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> with a free online proxy VPN and was finally successful although Mozilla's GUI didn't completely load correctly.  I am able to quickly and efficiently connect to every other website on the web with any browser including Firefox, but none of the web browsers including Firefox will connect to any Mozilla affiliated or Mozilla extension websites on my PC.  When trying to access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website, the page buffers for several minutes and then the page display's the error code PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR.  Sometimes I get an auto-update message on my Firefox browser that states that a new version is available and so I click to download the new version and all I get is buffering and no downloading.  Then a new message appears after a few minutes stating that Firefox didn't download correctly and that I need to reinstall Firefox.  I uninstall Firefox but cannot access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website to reinstall Firefox because after clicking the link to access the Mozilla webpage there is nothing but buffer and no access.  Using the free online web based VPN I was able to reinstall Firefox, but I still have to same issues.  If I run Windows 10 in safe mode with networking I am able to access all <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> websites and install Firefox extensions.  Is there any known fix to get this issue fixed while running my PC in normal mode apart from completely uninstalling and reinstalling Windows? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;certificates;windows-10;firefox-670;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1241879;1242147;1242174;1242215;1242501;1242503;,morete908,"id:1242503,created:2019-08-05 16:27:22 -0800,updated:2019-08-05 16:27:22 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>That was very good work.

Instead, they would give me a message indicating that my username and/or password were incorrect. I disabled the two step verification on Amazon, the login worked because they sent the OTP code to my email instead of my phone, and reported the problem to them. </p> id:1242092,created:2019-08-03 17:01:41 -0800,updated:2019-08-03 17:01:41 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>That was very good work.

I am using Mojave version 10.14.5. I have been using Safari and Google as the search engine without any issues. I can always sign in to Amazon using these products successfully. I recently switched to Firefox with the Duckduckgo search engine because I am tired of Google tracking me. I have the latest release of both offerings. That combination seems to work for everything but signing in to my Amazon account. When I use Firefox, it takes me to the Amazon sign in screen. My username and password are stored, so when I get to the login page, these values are automatically autofilled (and are valid). when the Amazon log in screen is autofilled, it asks to send an OTP code. I click OK and get a message that says Opps, something went wrong. Your username and /or password is invalid. </p><p>I clean out all history in Firefox, deleted my saved login and password for the Amazon site and tried it again. It allowed me to go to the login screen, I manually entered my username and password, saved them and clicked on send the OTP. I got the same error again. OOPs, something went wrong, invalid username and password. Tried multiple times over multiple days. Called Amazon support who concludes that since I can sign on with Safari and Google, then it must be a Firefox issue. I have searched the web and have not been able to find a solution. I would appreciate any help you might offer. Thank you. </p> id:1241868,created:2019-08-02 17:42:24 -0800,updated:2019-08-02 17:42:24 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Please explain the problem in detail.

Iâm sorry if this is getting drawn out but I canât figure out what changed that started the problem in the first place. </p> id:1241839,created:2019-08-02 14:47:58 -0800,updated:2019-08-02 14:47:58 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>The time/date shown are when the reports were sent to the Mozilla servers.

I mean local bank, SQL-Lite's standard. I just want to merge the History of several different profiles into a single database. The ""places.sqlite"" file located at root folder of each profile should store this history. How to add all records into a single bank? If there are any duplicates, what is the SQL command to remove them? </p><p>I have also installed SQLiteBrowser. What I need is familiarity with handling data bank records. </p><p>Putting it better, I don't intend to overwrite files in folders. All files in the profile folders will be intact. I do not want to open these tables in Firefox. It could even be after add everything, but that is not the intention. I just wanted to merge all history and favorites into one bank and remove any duplicates. For that, I need to know the SQL commands to handle these files properly, with ""append"", ""purge"", ""index"", etc. By not mastering SQL, I'm looking for someone who understands more than me to give me the way. </p><p>I am not quite sure, but it seems that the ""favicons.sqlite"" file should also be involved in the manipulations. I saw that there are several tables of each other. I would have to write SQL commands to split the banks by month. </p><p>Any idea? </p><p><br> Attached to this question, I submit the table structure of ""places.sqlite"" and ""favicons.sqlite"": </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-680;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1241630;1241668;1242052;,Gabarito,"id:1242052,created:2019-08-03 14:04:52 -0800,updated:2019-08-03 14:54:14 -0800,creator:Gabarito,updated_by:Gabarito,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi, guys. </p><p>I came back here to say that I was able to accomplish what I wanted with the history of Firefox. And to leave the way for someone else who has the same needs. </p><p>Among other files, Firefox keeps âplaces.sqliteâ in the root folder of the profile. In it we find the tables âmoz_historyvisitsâ and the âmoz_placesâ which is where the records that interest us the most. </p><p>There is also the ""favicons"" file that will store the icons of the visited URL's among other data. It's not that important to us, but it's good that he walks side by side with his respective places.sqlite. </p><p>The correlation of tables in the data banks is explained in the appendix (may be outdated). </p><p>The explanation of the âplaces.sqliteâ fields can be found <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Database"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. </p><p>Well, to manipulate the history records of various profile folders, I used a few programs namely: </p><p>1. Firefox itself; </p><p>2. the MZHistoryView tool, which can be found <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_history_view.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>; </p><p>3. firefox-history-merger, an open source CLI (command line) tool hosted on <a href=""https://github.com/crazy-max/firefox-history-merger"" rel=""nofollow"">Github</a>; </p><p>4. SQLiteBrowser to compact data banks that had some records deleted. It can be found <a href=""https://sqlitebrowser.org"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>; </p><p>With Firefox, I opened the history of each profile and deleted the months that already existed in other profiles. With SQLiteBrowser, I compressed data banks that had records deleted and could also inspect included records. With firefox-history-merger I have attached records from one ""places.sqlite"" to other ""places.sqlite"". With MZHistoryView I was able to track the amount of records attached, confirm the corresponding months and get a more complete view of the final result. This tool is not indispensable to reach the final result. </p><p>The firefox-history-merger tool also allows you to repair lost ""favicons.sqlite"" database icons. This action is also not essential to the end result. </p><p>With all this, I was able to take old histories and organize everything, eliminating redundancy of many folders and files stored in profiles. There were only lean ""places.sqlite"" files, sorted and without duplicates. </p><p>I researched about the maximum number of records and saw that maybe I could put it all together in one ""places.sqlite"" file. According to a <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/895302/how-do-i-set-max-browsing-history-size"" rel=""nofollow"">SuperUser topic</a>, this is possible after setting the <em>places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages</em> variable to <strong>2147483647</strong>, the largest integer for 32 bits) in <em>about: config</em>.

The issue is whether Firefox retains the history of where you saved the last download.â,  is not entirely true.  <strong>Mozilla WILL NOT ALLOW any screen capture or print to save any of the Mozilla screens â not config, options, forum entries, etc.</strong> </p><p>That being said, <strong>BECAUSE OF THIS BUG</strong>, I was forced to use the Windows Snip-it utility to produce the earlier <strong>about:config</strong> image with all but the sub-set of browser.download filtered out.  I have attached another âSnip-Itâ of my current settings after I made two changes, as described below.  (Config.JPG) </p><p><strong>My FFQ 68.0.1 about:config did not contain entries for either browser.download.lastDir or browser.download.dir.</strong> </p><p>So, I created both as âstrings.â   I added <strong>browser.download.lastDir</strong> with string value<strong> D:\</strong> and <strong>browser.download.dir</strong> with string value <strong>D:\Temp</strong>. </p><p>Today, when I went back into config, and the <strong>browser.download.lastDir </strong>had been deleted.   I restored it to the above value. </p><p>A âPrintâ (Cntl-P) SAVING AS A *.pdf or *.xpsâ, of any non-Mozilla webpages, <strong>ALWAYS remembers the last âPrintâ file save locations</strong> â even from session to session (although Mozilla does not always allow âprintingâ to a file with the complete set of the screen.) </p><p>I tried <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/savescreenshot/</a> , but it is severely limited in what can be ""captured"" (no ""Save Selected"" and ONLY saves to the C:\Users\doug\Downloads\ directory.) </p><p>I have tried ""Nimbus Capture"" (and other Web-Extensions) as well as Mozilla's own ""Take a Screenshotâ, both try to save consecutive files in C:\Users\doug\Downloads\. </p><p>I even contacted the Nimbus tech support, and as I have said in another comment, their answer was simply ""...Firefox doesn't allow it..."".  </p><p><strong>THAT WAS ALSO THE RESPONSE OF OTHER DEVELOPERS WHEN THE POORLY THOUGHT OUT ""EXTENSIONS"" BEGAN ROLLING OUT WITH V57+ - FIREFOX DOES NOT ALLOW IT. </strong> </p><p>THAT IS A PRETTY DEFINITIVE ANSWER - THE FAULT LIES WITH MOZILLA'S STUPID CHOICES REGARDING RESTRICTING THE H**L OUT OF ""EXTENSIONS"".<strong> </strong> </p><p>Since NO ADD-ON will allow saving consecutive screen prints to the navigated directory.  So, basically EVERY Screen Capture âtoolâ is incapable of remembering the last directory FOR SCREEN PRINTS. The âFileâ download of any other type of action, REMEMBERS THE LAST DIRECTORY USED â FROM SESSION TO SESSION. </p><p><strong>The problem is SIMPLY THE FAULT OF FIREFOXâS âWEB-EXTENSIONSâ RESTRICTIONS ON SAVING SCREEN CAPTURES. </strong> </p><p>THE STUPIDITY OF KILLING WHAT WAS <strong>THE ABSOLUTE WORLDâS BEST, MOST FUNCTIONAL âSCREEN CAPTUREâ ADD-ON</strong> (<strong>ScreenGrab â Fix Version</strong>), MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL SENSE, SINCE EVERY OTHER âSAVEâ IN FIREFOX WORKS CORRECTLY. </p><p>Why is Mozilla blocking an entire set of tools (including its own ""Take a Screenshotâ) as well as ALL SCREEN CAPTURE ADD-ONS from doing the same action as downloading any standard file, perfectly saving each file in the last directory used â including from session to session. </p><p><strong>If those files are safe to set the directory, until it is changed by the user, WHY DOES MOZZILA REFUSE TO ALLOW SCREEN CAPTURES THE SAME USER FREEDOM.</strong> </p><p>Your suggestion of constantly changing the save directory under options, would be extremely tedious, time consuming and SHOULD NEVER BE REQUIRED TO SIMPLY SAVE ALL FILES WHERE THE USER WANTS THEM STORED.
