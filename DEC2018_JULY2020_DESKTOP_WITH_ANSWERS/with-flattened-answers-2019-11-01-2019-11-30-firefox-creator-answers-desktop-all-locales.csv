1273994,2019-11-30 08:57:16 -0800,2019-11-30T11:30:39Z,"saving a page needs two attempts, then I get poor fonts and no formatting","<p>When I save a page, the download icon always has a yellow dot, and the only way to remove it is to re-download the item. I've had the  issue for about a month. I've found it incredibly handy to open the download folder from the drop down menu of the download icon. And that option is not available if the the download fails. Instead, a repeat download icon is displayed. So, I've had to comply and re-start the download every time.  </p><p>Wondering if the first download was indeed faulty, I navigated to the download folder using Explorer and found the page replicated just fine. But it turns out that the second download screws up my fonts and formatting. This I did not know until today. </p><p>To see if I could figure out the difference between the first download and the repeat thereof, I created two folders, 'first' and 'second' as sub-folders to the download folder. Because I would overwrite the files with the repeat download, I preserved the first download by moving those files into the first folder. The first folder now contained a .htm file and a files sub-folder. The original download location was empty. I then repeated the download, and found but a single .htm file was downloaded.  </p><p>When I open the single .htm file, the fonts are messed up as well as the formatting. So, thinking that the second download needed it's _files directory, I copied that back, and sure enough everything looked good again. I also compared the first .htm file with the second, and they are identical. </p><p>My next test was to copy (not move) the _files folder to preserve it, between the first and second download, then compare them. There are differences! There's an extra .htm file in the first download, that's missing in the second. There's an extra .xht file in the second download that is missing in the first. There's a zero length file in each download with unique names, not in the other: mark1_data exists in the first download; a_data in the second. I assumed that zero length files would be fruitless to test further. </p><p>I next tried to add the missing .htm file from the first download into the second _files folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting. I also removed the extra file from the second folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting either. </p><p>I'll attach the difference listing between the _files folders. The left side has red highlighting and is against the first _files folder and identifies files present there, but not in the second. The right side has green highlighting and is against the second _files folder and shows files present that are not in the first. I'll also attach a sample of good fonts/formatting from the first download, and bad fonts/formatting from the second. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;firefox-700;firefox-7001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1269841;1269843;,needsleep,"id:1269843,created:2019-11-30 11:30:39 -0800,updated:2019-11-30 11:30:39 -0800,creator:needsleep,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Going into the drop down list, hovering over the filename, gives precious little additional information, I'm sad to say. </p><p>Without hovering we see, ""Failed.""

The PC originated as an IBM product (then knock offs, which I built 12+ of FROM SCRATCH myself, before laptops) with the DOS operating system sold to MICROSOFT.  For most PC users, PC means DOS/WINDOWS based machines.  MACs are MACs.  Otherwise, we would need to rename all smart devices, cell phones, etc. as PC's, since they ARE also simply a variation on a ""Personal Computer"".  </p><p>I have been a mainframe programmer and systems analyst <strong>SINCE 1982.</strong>  </p><p>GIVEN THAT, WHEN <strong>SOMEONE WHO HAS USED PCs SINCE THEY WERE FIRST INTRODUCED (LATE 1980'S) - THE PC ACRONYM ""PC"", FOR PC LITERATE USERS, HAS ONLY APPLIED TO IBM-STYLE ORIGINAL MACHINES, COMBINED WITH MICROSOFT DOS/WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM.</strong> </p><p>The statement ""Platform means Linux or Mac or Windows"" is historically wrong - THOSE ARE JUST GENERIC, SUBSTITUTIONS FOR THE OPERATING SYSTEM - WITH THE VERSION LEFT OFF. </p><p>THAT REALLY IS NOT THE ISSUE - <strong>FIREFOX IS BROKEN</strong>.  AS I HAVE SAID MULTIPLE TIMES THIS ISSUE IS APPARENTLY UNRELATED TO THE OS - AS IT HAS BEEN STATED BY OTHER POSTERS,<strong> IT HAPPENS WITH EVERY OS.</strong> </p><p>That being said, <strong>YOU DID NOT READ MY VERY LENGTHY, DETAILED COMMENTS WHERE I QUOTED PARTS OF OTHER OF MY REPLIES - WHICH CLEARLY ANSWER NEARLY EVERY QUESTION THAT YOU JUST RE-ASKED AGAIN.</strong> </p><p>Mozilla clearly has a problem. </p><p><strong>You can read my lengthy reply, AND YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT I HAVE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION, in that reply except about ""Themes"", which I will now address.</strong> </p><p>I am very well aware of how themes work AND KNOW VERY WELL HOW TO CHANGE THEM. </p><p>I primarily use a suite of software, by StarDock, which can change the appearance of nearly all Windows based systems. </p><p>That method HAS NEVER CAUSED ME A PROBLEM, WITH ANY SOFTWARE, INCLUDING FIREfOX.  EVERY OTHER PROGRAM (NOTE IMAGES #3 AND #4, IN MY LAST REPLY), where both of those images were captured - WHILE USING StarDock PROGRAMS.  (WHICH I HAVE LOYALLY SUPPORTED FOR WELL OVER 7-10 YEARS.) </p><p>However, the only impacted title bar/Windows controls IS FIREFOX.  Which has been caused by Mozilla 70+. </p><p>The first 2 images in my last reply, illustrate the FireFox problem. </p><p>These 2 are captured in a different way.  As a very long-term Windows user (since Windows 3.1) I am very aware of how to change the themes with just Windows Control Panel themes. </p><p>I disabled all StarDock programs, re-booted and switched to Windows Control Panel ""Personalization"".  I intentionally set the desktop to black, so that each window will show its borders.  (Unfortunately, since v70+, FireFox does not.) </p><p>Within Windows Personalization, I also changed the desktop, with Windows Themes.  THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE. </p><p>I also tried changing the FF Themes.  NONE OF THEM SHOW A LEGIBLE TITLE LINE (JUST LOGO, AS THE IMAGE YOU ATTACHED, CLEARLY ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS NO VISIBLE, LEGIBLE TITLE TEXT.  I cannot tell from your capture, if there are any VISIBLE, STANDARD  Windows Control buttons, on the right corner of the TITLE BAR.) </p><p><em><strong>Again, cor-el, I am NOT trying to insult or demean you.</strong></em> </p><p>I am just getting extremely frustrated when you keep trying to make me look like an idiot.

I do suspect that MACs may have fairly similar themes to Window's ""AERO"" themes (just fairly standard shape and control themes.  The ones for Windows are in many colors and textures, but retain most other ""AERO"" design features. </p><p>That may satisfy many user's frustration with this FF problem - but probably just as a temporary work-around.

It is old as it refers to Version 3 &amp; 4 and I am running Version 75 but maybe it will give you some info. You might also want to look at Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_version_history"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_version_history</a> and look through the history to see if there is anything there about color management. Also I agree, Color Management can be difficult to understand and get correct. Most photographers have a problem printing their photos to match the screen. Been there done that and wrestled. The main problem in matching screen to print is prints come out dark. I used to increase brightness of an image by 25% before printing to get it close. So I figured with a better monitor and the ability to calibrate it would solve the problem and it did after doing what a friend at one of my photo clubs recommended.  ""As far has having the print look like the monitor, that is tricky. Colors will never match exactly because color spaces are different and the paper has reflected light  and the monitor makes light. But you can get very close with the a calibrated monitor set at the correct brightness. Often, monitors are too bright which leads the photographer to compensate by adjusting the image too dark. Then it is printed too dark. For a reasonably bright room, 120 cd/m2 is recommended. My editing environment is fairly dark and I set my brightness to 75 cd/m2."" My room is not dark but also not bright, I finally found 80-85 cd/m2 worked for my environment. This probably has nothing to do with how things look on the web but thought I would share it anyway. </p> id:1310315,created:2020-05-04 06:46:42 -0800,updated:2020-05-04 06:46:42 -0800,creator:amonsloane,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>AggiePilot <a href=""#answer-1310039"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> I had noticed my JPG sRGB photos looked over saturated using Firefox but not Chrome.

I downloaded some utilities from the ICC website that I could only about 10% understand, but one of them is supposed to check for compliance with ICC standards, and it said that my profile was non-compliant for a few reasons that I didn't understand at all (I think it was something like xyz: negative z value, or something like that?). So I'm thinking that's the issue. Especially because I can make Chrome look the same as Firefox by setting the ""Force Color Profile"" flag to ""sRGB"" (which would imply that Firefox is also using sRGB as its color space instead of my monitor profile). Unfortunately I currently don't have any way of creating a new profile, and the default profile is hot garbage, so I think I'm out of luck until I can buy an actual colorimeter. </p><p>But just to confirm my suspicion, does anyone know for sure that Firefox does in fact reject non-compliant color profiles in its color management? </p> id:1310181,created:2020-05-03 11:13:48 -0800,updated:2020-05-03 11:13:48 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This article is very old, but it's the reference for what the different color management preference values do: </p><p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/3.5/ICC_color_correction_in_Firefox#Configuring_color_correction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/3.5/ICC_color_correction_in_Firefox#Configuring_color_correction</a> </p> id:1310166,created:2020-05-03 10:19:13 -0800,updated:2020-05-03 10:19:13 -0800,creator:dfconn,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have the same issue on Mac running Catalina - this is a MAJOR ONGOING problem with an otherwise terrific browser - the browser needs to be fixed...it does not work properly with any color profiles </p> id:1310039,created:2020-05-02 12:48:02 -0800,updated:2020-05-02 12:48:02 -0800,creator:AggiePilot,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Will, I have an NEC PA127Q-BK monitor and running Windows10.

Chrome has this very convenient feature that keeps a history item from opening on top of your current page - often you want to compare or add what you saw in history to what you're seeing on the current page without making the current page disappear and having to backpage, thus losing the history page you want displayed at the same time. This seems like an easy enough feature to include that FF is ignoring, like it ignores the longtime request that Firefox enable cut &amp; paste to retain website formatting and functions when pasting into an email (and screenshots don't retain functions like links). If there are enough inconveniences to using FF, people use another browser, and if Chrome and Safari can include such conveniences, so can Firefox. </p>",desktop;tabs;firefox-700;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1269342;1269399;,wlegro,"id:1269399,created:2019-11-27 15:49:17 -0800,updated:2019-11-27 15:49:17 -0800,creator:wlegro,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Well, like tens of millions of other people I use a trackpad - thus no left, right or middle clicking.

I have tried using the ""custom"" option and deselecting the 4 tracker options but every site still has ETP enabled, and it is far too time consuming to have to manually turn it off for every website I visit. I would like to find out 1) what I'm doing wrong that the method I've tried to disable ETP isn't working (yes, I reload the page every time), and 2) is there an ""about:config"" tweak that will turn off ETP globally, as in across the web, and on every new FF session I start?

Newly created bookmarks disappear when the session is ended and new one is started. If I create a new profile and copy the contents of the old one, the problems come with it. I've tried removing add-ons, but none seem to be the cause. Safe mode works, but that's not a long-term solution. I've reinstalled FF, but copying the profile brings the problems with it. </p><p>My latest attempt is to create a new profile and import bookmarks, creating a new places.sqlite file. I copied a variety of other files (prefs.js, extentions*, key3.db, key4.db) and so far everything still works. </p><p>There's one issue with extensions.json and extensions.sqlite. These point to the extensions directory of the old, corrupted profile. This works, but obviously is not desirable. It's easy to do a find/replace on the .json file, but without changing the the .sqlite file this breaks extensions. Fixing the .sqlite file is harder (at least for me), but do-able.

I've never had any issues with anything. I've had the same 3 extensions running since the installation of Firefox(Momentum tabs, Popup blocker and uBlock Origin)  </p><p>But recently, Firefox has been uploading insane amount of data to the point where it just does not make sense. I'm adding two images, 1st shows my trend over the last 4 months while the 2nd shows how much data Firefox has been sending while being on (with a reset) for about 4h. </p><p>It became an issue because i usually do not close my computer and leave Firefox open with the tabs open (on average 5) and it was consuming all that data while i was at work While a ""fix"" could be well, close your Firefox, if this keeps up I'll just switch browser. </p><p>As far as what tabs are kept open a few Stock images website, GogoAnime, and usually my e-mails or work where i've left it off. No streaming website is left opened </p><p>I've got no active VPN connections, I've got complete control of my network and am beyond 100% certain that the issue comes from firefox, no other IP are on my network and lastly disabling all of my extensions has not changed the behavior of Firefox. My Firefox is up to date, (70.0.1) so everything else on my computer, from windows, gpu to all other drivers </p><p>Any help would be appreciated, otherwise i'll just change browser.

I'm getting completely sick of Mozilla programs, especially since they turned Firefox and Thunderbird into nagware.  They wonder why people don't want to update to the most recent version, but there is an obvious answer:  Every time Mozilla upgrades a program, users' add-ons are broken, and they have to start over to customize the program.  Mozilla just doesn't care about the inconvenience they cause their users.  If Mozilla put lots of features into their programs, then people wouldn't have to load them up with add-ons, but Mozilla won't do that.  And now they have turned their programs into nagware, and all because there is a very small chance that someone might pick up a computer virus or malware.

Why doesn't firefox give me the option of opting out of syncing ""add-on settings""?","<p>Hi all, </p><p>Since a few months ago, Firefox started syncing add-on settings without giving you the option to opt out of it. I'm not talking about syncing the add-ons themselves which is a great thing and also the user can turn it off. I'm talking about add-on settings, syncing of which can be problematic. For example, I have a few website blocker add-ons. I have given these add-ons a list of websites to block on my older son's computer, while I have given them a different list to block on my younger son's computer. This is not viable anymore because Firefox syncs all their settings without asking me. The other problem is that even the disable/enable option of these add-ons are synced, which means that if I have these website blockers enabled on my sons' computers, they are also enabled on my own computer. Consequently, if I disable them on my own computer, they will be disabled on my sons' computers. This is a major issue. I have previously contacted Firefox about this, but I assume it has been lost in the large number feedback that they receive. </p><p>The blocker add-on was just an example, so please don't offer me solutions for that one add-on.

It appears from your question, that you are using Firefox Sync as a back up service. This is not what Sync is designed to do. The Firefox Sync service takes a copy of the data you wish to include and transfers it to a second device (typically a mobile device such as a tablet or a telephone) running a copy of Firefox. The storage in between all attached devices is both temporary and fragile and is not stable enough to be (and is not designed as) a reliable backup service.

However, if this is the only domain that you have saved to the extension, there is a more technical way that we can remove it from the list. </p><p>First, go to the <code>about:debugging</code> page in Firefox. On that page, select <strong>This Firefox</strong> from the left-side of the screen. There should be a list of the extensions that you have installed on Firefox. </p><p>On that list, there should be the Facebook Container extension and you should be able to click the <strong>Inspect</strong> button for it. That will open the developer tools in a new tab. </p><p>If it's not already selected, go to <strong>Console</strong> at the top of the page. This is the section where certain error messages and technical data is displayed, but we can also enter lines of code in this window to run on the extension. </p><p>In this case, you remove all domains that been associated with the extension (excluding of course the default Facebook-owned ones), you can copy and paste the following line of code: </p> <pre>browser.storage.local.set({domainsAddedToFacebookContainer: []});</pre> <blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> It's a pretty long line of code, so it may not fully display on this website. It might appear in a scrollable section on this page, so make sure that you copy all of it. Triple clicking on the line of text above is probably the easiest way to select the entire line.</blockquote> <p>Once you have pasted that into the console window, you can press the <strong>Enter</strong> key on your keyboard. When you do that, you may get some text that refers to a <strong>Promise</strong>. That's perfect. </p><p>Then, if you close all Firefox windows and open Firefox again, that domain should be removed. </p><p>Hope this helps. Sorry it's not the most user-friendly solution, but I don't believe that there is an easier way to do this at the moment. </p>"

Mi dominio no figura en ninguna lista negra, y no tengo ningún problema de spam. Mis mensajes llegan a su destino y sistemáticamente hago la prueba en sentido contrario para verificar el funcionamiento de las cuentas de correo y detectar si alguna ha caído en alguna lista negra. No he visto ningún sitio web con mi dominio, no he dicho tal cosa, lo que digo es que alguien aparece en las búsquedas publicando información tomada textualmente de mi sitio web, como si se tratase de mi sitio web, pero ocultando su dirección real. Cuando se hace clic en esos enlaces el navegador bloquea el acceso al contenido alertando de un peligro inminente (como debe ser), pero la dirección real de destino es ocultada y la que se muestra en la barra de navegación son mis direcciones auténticas, lo cual le hace pensar al que navega que ha intentado entrar a mi dominio, y eso es justamente lo que me preocupa. Si copias esas direcciones auténticas y las pegas en otra pestaña entras a mi sitio web sin ningún problema, lo cual significa que el contenido peligroso está alojado en otra dirección, no dentro de mi sitio web. Y lo que digo es que de alguna forma (cosa que no debería ser posible en un navegador) el delincuente se las ha arreglado para que el navegador intente entrar a una dirección pero muestre otra auténtica en la barra de navegación, y esa es una vulnerabilidad del navegador, porque un navegador, por diseño, nunca debería permitir una inconsistencia entre la dirección que se muestra en la barra y aquella de donde proviene el contenido. Me he dado cuenta de que el problema está relacionada con las búsquedas realizadas con ""DuckDuckGo"", no ocurre con Google. Parece como si la extensión de ""DuckDuckGo"", una vez instalada en Firefox, introdujese esa vulnerabilidad.

Thanks. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-700;,firefox,other,en-US,1268364;1268367;1268372;1268374;,sc894707,"id:1268374,created:2019-11-23 00:20:16 -0800,updated:2019-11-23 00:20:16 -0800,creator:sc894707,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1268367"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> See also: <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-monitor-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-monitor-faq</a> </li><li><a href=""https://monitor.firefox.com/security-tips"" rel=""nofollow"">https://monitor.firefox.com/security-tips</a> </li></ul> </blockquote> <p>Thank you for taking time to respond but neither of these links will be helpful. I checked faq, hopefully I did it properly,  and it isn't a security tip matter nevertheless I did look there too. All I would like to do is remove the notifications.  Except for these two incidences security hasn't been a big issue. I've had myself removed from those two sites. I expected better from one company.  For such things I will more often use a secondary email address. </p> id:1268372,created:2019-11-23 00:11:29 -0800,updated:2019-11-23 00:11:29 -0800,creator:sc894707,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you for replying. I'm interested in what you have suggested with the Steps 1,2 and 3.  I've been spending time on it so far can't make  it work. I presume you mean the 3 horizontal lines menu ? There is quite lot there but none of them is Options &gt; Content. I've tried all different ways, being signed in , signed out, being on the specific Monitor site, the Mozilla site and just having Firefox open on my home page, the same menu appears. My system is MacOS 10.11.6.   I've also looked in Firefox Preferences and there is mention of Content but only to do with Home Content regarding how I wish to have things set up.  I'll try again tomorrow. The faq don't seem to be of any help, I did scan them a couple of times and also ""asked"" the question and nothing turned up, likewise as it isn't a security tip that section didn't help either. The 2 notified breaches are the only ones I've had and I did address them.  Nothing has come up for a long time now. </p> id:1268367,created:2019-11-22 21:26:19 -0800,updated:2019-11-22 21:26:19 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>See also: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-monitor-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-monitor-faq</a> </li><li><a href=""https://monitor.firefox.com/security-tips"" rel=""nofollow"">https://monitor.firefox.com/security-tips</a> </li></ul> id:1268364,created:2019-11-22 21:05:54 -0800,updated:2019-11-22 21:05:54 -0800,creator:akilas765,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Step 1- </p><p>Open Mozilla Firefox browser, then go to Firefox menu and select options. </p><p>Step 2- </p><p>Select the content segment and tap on the choose button under Notifications. </p><p>Step 3- </p><p>A Notification Permissions window will pop-up.

When trying to sign out of <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>,  the three items My account, My profile, Sign out </p><p>simply disappear.  I delete cookies and downloaded site data &amp; web pages often, at least three times a week.  This made no difference with this Outlook problem.  Since getting workable recommendations from the community is often frustrating, I came up with the following work-around:     From a Chrome browser, I copied the URL for the sign out button  which reads  <a href=""https://login.live.com/logout.srf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.live.com/logout.srf</a> </p><p>Then I pasted this into the URL line (aka address line or search box) of the Firefox browser.  Then I saved it to the Bookmarks toolbar, so it is visible at all times.  So whenever the sign out button disappears, I click on my very own ""Signout of <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> button"" or shortcut.      Simple and effective, not elegant, the computing equivalent of duct tape!    </p><p>Another method, which requires less thought, is to exit out of Outlook by clicking on the  X  which closes the tab, and then right away try to sign in again to Outlook. The effect is that sometimes the missing buttons reappear. Inconsistent and wobbly effects - how come?  </p><p>This happens on a Win 10 Home, 64bit computer, with AMD Ryzen CPU, with 8 MG Ram,  on which I run Avast Internet Security, with the Microsoft firewall disabled.   Asking Avast a question is generally useless. I have tried. </p><p>The latest MSFT update appears to have destroyed my Dropbox setup, and made Adobe Reader DC unresponsive.  Re-installed both, and found that Adobe Reader DC has two security settings that need to be disabled for it to even open at all.   When a program (aka App) does not open, then it's like locking your key in the car, because you can't change its settings.   Thus, through trial and error, I found that in the Windows Register, at the address: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\DC\TrustManager there are two settings that have to be set from  (1) to (0) namely:  bEnhancedSecurityInBrowser  and </p><pre>               bEnhancedSecurityStandalone </pre> <p>then Reader DC opens again, of course without whatever value the EnhancedSEcurityinBrowser might have provided.  So, you use this at your own risk, just so you can open that PDF.   (Also make a backup of the registry before you make changes there, in case you ruin something. And make a note of what you did, so you can change it back.)  </p><p>I am aware of the ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" fallacy, and I cut myself shaving with ""Occam's Razor"" often enough.  So, I can be wrong, and I often am.  It could be that Avast is at fault here.   It could be a hacking  attack, or it could be that Outlook wishes to attack Firefox, or runs an enhanced and thus faulty webpage.

Then I made two copies of the profile folder, named them, and created new profiles by editing the profiles.ini file. This worked fine. We now have a working profile each, and the original default profile as a backup. So each of us opens our new Firefox profile and wants to delete the bookmarks that are not ours.

Doubt they are, either. </p><p>They must use a contract vendor to run the site.  It's been &gt;&gt; a month since 1st asked them to tell me what they use to sniff the browser, because it was up to date &amp; ""general.useragent.override"" reflected that.  Generally, their IT dept isn't very helpful.  I had to call them to tell them to upgrade OpenSSL when the big bug surfaced while back, after ~ 90% of financial institutions had upgraded.  They knew nothing of it.

Obviously, Chrome doesn't use Gecko engine. </p><p>So their site didn't complain about outdated browser or screwy UA string.  Their site displayed the same as always.

In fact, I didn't change the UA string back to a valid one yet &amp; this site is displaying OK. </p><p>One issue in using any browser in LInux (as useragent string)  is a very small pool of users, increasing fingerprint ability.

Keep mind that the Sync server that holds your data is shared by many other users and depending upon the overall load on that server can limit the time each account can be transferring or organizing user data, which means a complete sync can take quite awhile in some cases. </p> <hr> <p><em><strong>""And I have all my bookmarks lying in the ""Bookmark menu"" Why is this happening?

While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page.

More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>. </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page.

Help please?!,"<p>Hi Folks, </p><p>I'm still using an older version of firefox to keep essential add-ons that Quantum no longer had.  I'm having problems on a windows 7 computer with the version I have on it, and would like advice on the best way to proceed.   </p><p>I had copied over my profile from a different computer where I'd been using FF55.  I'd had some problems with 55, so I installed 52 on this computer, but using that profile.  It's not working very well as I can't get vertical tabs or vertical tabs reloaded to work, it's also crashing fairly often for no apparent reason, etc.  Now even the ""+"" symbol to add a new tab has disappeared from the tab bar, and I don't have a clue why or how to get it back!).  For what it's worth, this isn't a malware/virus problem - I'm running McAfee and also periodically malwarebytes etc., and scans aren't finding problems. Computer has been restarted several times and so on, and I'm still having the problems.  Could this be because the profile was from a firefox 55 version and it's being used on a FF52 version? Or would that not cause this sort of problem? </p><p>I don't want to go to 56 because I gather it won't be able to access my older saved sessions (I use Session Manager and those are the sessions I'm concerned about - so if this is NOT a problem, please let me know).  I'm concerned about this because wiki says:  ""...Another change was the introduction of the mozlz4 format, a proprietary variant of the lz4 compression format (.mozlz4 and .jsonlz4 file extensions instead of .json.lz4 as per unix/linux standard). Session data is stored in the lz4 format instead of plain text. Firefox 56 can not recognize the legacy plain text session files, only the lz4-encoded ones...."" </p><p>So I'm wondering if I should go to 55 on this computer, or 52ESR?  I gather the ESR would have better security - but want to know if there's a difference in add-on compatibility or other features since 52ESR is, I gather, based on older code than 55? </p><p>If someone could talk me thru the pros and cons of using 55 versus 52ESR I'd sure appreciate it!!! </p><p>Also, I would be VERY grateful if folks could point me towards: 1. a reasonably safe site where we can search and install legacy add-ons 2. any webpage which has a good information showing which legacy add-ons now have reasonable replacements in the current FF version. </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-530;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1267406;1267409;1267410;1267413;1267414;1267416;1268458;1268463;1268505;1268585;1268586;1268598;,Anonymoose,"id:1268598,created:2019-11-23 23:23:29 -0800,updated:2019-11-23 23:23:29 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>See this article for more detail: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-ons-disabled-or-fail-to-install-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-ons-disabled-or-fail-to-install-firefox</a> </li></ul> id:1268586,created:2019-11-23 21:56:21 -0800,updated:2019-11-23 21:56:21 -0800,creator:Anonymoose,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1268505"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> You should see all extensions listed on the ""Help -&gt; Troubleshooting Information"" (about:support) page.

When I go to log on from the home page it does not ask for my password but goes to a redirect message then back to the home page. This has become annoying as I like to use Firefox not Chrome. </p>"

My first assumption was possibly something to do with flash, or maybe a re-install of Firefox.

I don't use private browsing or disabled offline cache like I saw in other threads, and I use only 4 regular extensions. The funny thing is that the buttons become functional on their own after a couple of minutes if I just leave the tab open. So it seems that Firefox is running some very long process before enabling these buttons the first time the settings page is opened. If I close the privacy settings tab and open it again, then these two buttons immediately appear enabled, not grayed out. </p><p>Firefox should probably change the very confusing and counter-intuitive way it is handling these two buttons, or at least display some animated icon to indicate it is doing some stuff, but if it's reading all cookies before deciding to enable the two buttons (and I don't think I have an unusual number of cookies), I'd rather have Firefox enable these buttons immediately and run this cookies analysis process AFTER I click on one of these two buttons, not before. By the way, it would be great if the about:support page could provide the number of cookies or web sites with cookies so we might use this for technical support. I have no idea how many I have and if this number is a problem. </p><p>In any case, for all other users that experience the grayed out cookie management buttons: Leave the settings tab open, do other stuff on Firefox or the computer, and come back to this settings tab after a few minutes, you'll find the two buttons enabled. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-700;firefox-7001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1267117;1267159;,michel.walkowiak,"id:1267159,created:2019-11-17 08:59:14 -0800,updated:2019-11-17 08:59:14 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Start Firefox in <u>Safe Mode</u> to check if one of the extensions (""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Extensions) or if <u>hardware acceleration</u> is causing the problem. </p> <ul><li>switch to the DEFAULT theme: ""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt;  Themes </li><li>do NOT click the ""Refresh Firefox"" button on the Safe Mode start window </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems</a> </li></ul> id:1267117,created:2019-11-17 03:16:53 -0800,updated:2019-11-17 03:16:53 -0800,creator:Scribe_uk,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi, I think that happens when Firefox is checking the cache size. </p>"

One can just shut them down by for instance using right click on the rightmost displayed one and then select close tabs to the right, to close all the others that are scrolled off screen.  Alternatively, I use multi-row tabs (which I think should be the default or at least an option), to show all the tabs that are open. This is great.

They also removed the ability to switch engines, meaning you have to nominate your engine every single time you search. </p><p>On top of this, Mozilla reversed the order you do things: It used to be that first you chose the type of content you wanted, then you thought about your exact query. But now, you first have to specify your exact query and THEN think about the type of content you want to search for, which is totally counter-intuitive and terrible interface design. It's like being asked for the name of the meal, movie or book you want, before you've even decided whether you want a meal, movie or book! </p><p>The reason Mozilla gave for these awful changes was to ""make searching faster"", but that simply is not the case. The new search bar requires just as many clicks, yet it's drastically slower to use as it's almost impossible to find the engine you're looking for from all the unlabeled engines. Plus, having to type your query first is completely counterintuitive to the user's thought process and slows things down even further. </p><p>Solution: </p><p>For a couple of years, Classic Theme Restorer was the perfect solution, bringing back the old bar exactly as it should be. However, since Firefox Quantum, Classic Theme Restorer doesn't work, so I've been using Jefferson Scher's excellent userchrome script.

Sometimes the initial Sync process can take many hours for the Sync server to properly arrange all the bookmarks on a ""mobile"" device and that cam affect the bookmarks organization process on a laptop /  desktop version of Firefox, too.

It is a good system as designed - but I found that one of my W10 PCs had only two backups, and all of them had huge gaps in the saved-bookmark dates. A few sequential, then a gap of weeks or months and another set - but hardly any more than two days in a row. And old backups are pretty useless to me. This is odd because have been I using FF as my main browser for a while now - I would expect consistent backing up every day. So why are the backups so unreliable? Is there anything I can do to make sure FF backs up every day (like it is supposed to!) ? My FF installs are kept up to date.

Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally. </p><p>I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed. </p><p>The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it. </p><p>(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text) </p><p>From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates. </p><p>Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here? </p><p>Thanks in advance, Rasmus </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;firefox-700;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1266963;1268198;1268259;1269465;1269478;1269657;1269677;1269692;1269714;1270108;1270116;1270729;1271164;1271588;1272902;1272906;,Dryminator,"id:1272906,created:2019-12-12 04:43:42 -0800,updated:2019-12-12 04:43:42 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Good to hear.

I typed in Firefox and you are NOT in their list of supported applications.  Facebook, Twitter, Chrome, etc. are all there.  Moreover, I could NOT add Firefox as one of their supported applications.  I had to submit a request. Did it EVER occur to the Firefox Developers that maybe before you throw up a list of Authenticator Apps that support FireFox, that you first determine if they actually do????????    This is sixth grade coding and a waste of thirty minutes.  It makes me question if any of the supposed features in your browser are anything more than ""Vaporware"".

As for AVG I was notified by email that they were going to a third party billing service and had ""handed over"" their customer's payment info and preferences to that party. This was just prior to the renewal date of my subscription for their software. The email was received after this was done. Upon further investigation, I found that my dashboard in my account had been eliminated along with my entire purchase history of almost 10 years Customers can no longer access their payment methods much less change them. Since my card was due to expire, I intentionally allowed it to because I had no intention of continuing any business with a company that employs these tactics.I even instructed the bank to decline any requests for payment by AVG or their new third party billers. I received emails from AVG right up until the date of renewal telling me they could NOT process my renewal. Three days later it showed up as PAID on my statement. I'd say I was hacked. They had no current card info on me. So yes I believe this was done by AVG because I dared to complain and refused to renew my subscription for their software. Their new biller changed the product I had to a basic version of internet security, charged me 79.95 for something you can buy online or at any retailer for twenty plus dollars AND signed me up for AUTO RENEWAL Yeah, I'd say I was targeted. </p> id:1267097,created:2019-11-17 00:48:23 -0800,updated:2019-11-17 00:48:23 -0800,creator:Scribe_uk,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>No it should not be in Downloads.

When you open a file using a program, Firefox saves it to the temporary storage on your computer instead of the regular download folder, so this could be causing some issue. </p><p>The only other thing I can think of at the moment is that maybe Firefox's download limit has been set really low for some reason.

Do you have some sort of ad block that reroutes the urls of ads?  The addons are acting as a man in the middle to route your traffic straight to you and the host, but it also reroutes the ad traffic so it either goes to a blank image or just blocks the ad url.

With Javascript, I change divs, tables, &amp;c., from display:none to, e.g., display:block.  All the attributes work EXCEPT the background image.  So, for example, if background color is #000000, the background shows solid black, and if I change that ahead of time or even on the fly to, e.g., #FF0000, the background changes onclick to solid red.  But, the background image appears pretty much at random as the computer pleases.  So, for example, the background-image is set by css for a table where display:none is the setting.  The template changes the table to display:inline-block.  The table appears, the background color appears, but often no background image appears UNLESS I open the console and uncheck, then recheck some property, e.g., height, associated with the background image.  If, however, I set the initial table property to, e.g., display:inline, the initial result shows a bunch of garbage, but once the display is switched to inline-block, all the background images appear normally and regularly.  This appears to be some kind of bug with Firefox, but for the life of me, I cannot fix it.

Frustrated, i decided to fully uninstal and download and re-install afreash. However, after doubleclicking the .exe Firefox install file the process stalls after unpacking saying ""You may not have the necessary permissions to use all the features of the program you are about to run. You may run this program as  a different user or continue to run the program as the current user."" The two options are; run as current user or run as administrator (with associated password field). Choosing the first option then stalls the instal process. Choosing the second option there is a login or password conflict, even though the current user 'is' the administrator account. Help required please. </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-700;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1266309;,Darce,"id:1266309,created:2019-11-12 14:23:44 -0800,updated:2019-11-12 14:23:44 -0800,creator:Darce,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Okay, hold your horses.

I am running current Firefox on current W10 64bit 1903 desktop PC using Ethernet with Spectrum as my ISP.  I am having a couple of problems in Firefox that are not happening in current Chrome.  1.  Page-not-found 2-8 times a day that resolve every time by simply clicking the ""retry"" (or something close to that) button.   I reset my router to ""factory"" and installed most current router firmware but that did not help.  Netgear Support has been unable to help.  2.  In current LastPass addon, I have to re-login to LastPass every time I start Firefox - did not used to do that (a year ago), and in Chrome or Edge that does not happen.   I have re-installed the LastPass add-on.  I have upgraded Firefox many times and have cleared history/cache many times.   So now I want to COMPLETELY remove Firefox, reboot,  and then install Firefox from scratch.  Can someone please point me to the web page that tells me how to properly remove all of Firefox so that I can re-download/install it from the beginning?  I do not care about retaining my Firefox settings or other from my current Firefox install. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-700;firefox-7001;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1265630;1265642;1265643;1265652;1265723;1265797;1265802;1265811;1265829;1266288;1266411;1266743;1268204;1268652;1268659;1268723;1269061;1269062;1269442;1269467;1269798;1269906;1270034;1270069;1270282;1270285;1270339;1308287;,cwr64,"id:1308287,created:2020-04-24 12:27:06 -0800,updated:2020-04-24 12:27:06 -0800,creator:andynurul1337,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>When the Firefox make problem I just go to download the new version of Firefox beta with high speed and more fast launching browser....

These options work perfectly for EVERY other program on this computer and also system sounds with Win 10 Pro. When I have the headphones connected and positively working within ALL other programs and Win sounds, the volume mixer sees that I have firefox running and shows the firefox logo slider as in above picture. It also shows the headphones as active in the device slider, and Applications/System sounds slider. All are unmuted. There is no GRAY activity within any of the sliders, as there should be, when firefox application is running a tab with the sound icon displayed on the index tab of the page. This page index tab icon is also unmuted. When I change the device to the realtek driver, I get another firefox slider in the volume mixer which immediately shows grey activity within it, and when unmuted, works to sound from the computer speakers, but not to the headset. Interestingly, when I do  this driver switch in the volume mixer, the system sounds slider disappears, and 2 separate sliders with firefox icons and the realtek driver device slider are visible, and both of the firefox icon sliders come up muted, with only the new firefox icon slider showing gray activity within it.

The reason it's 25 is that Firefox can ""undo"" the closing of up to 25 tabs (by default). So if you accidentally close a large number of tabs, you can restore them one-by-one using any of these methods: </p> <ul><li> right-click tab &gt; Undo Close Tab </li><li> Ctrl+Shift+t </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; Library &gt; History &gt; Recently Closed Tabs </li><li> Library toolbar button &gt; History &gt; Recently Closed Tabs </li><li> (menu bar) History &gt; Recently Closed Tabs </li></ul> <p>Was that what you were looking for, or one of the other warnings? </p><p><em>If you set Firefox to automatically restore your session, the warning for closing out your session is near the beginning of the Options page, or set </em>browser.sessionstore.warnOnQuit<em> to true.</em> </p>"

This is happening on my Win10 machine - my Win7 box is not having any issues since the update. </p><p>I have followed the advice of creating new profiles, checking for locked profiles (and being unable to remove the lock?).  I have completely removed Firefox from my system - uninstalled via control panel, deleted all folders in Program Files and Users etc, removed temp files and edited the registry to completely remove any Mozilla/Firefox entries.  Completely clean install - as far as I can tell - but the problem re-appears as soon as Firefox is reinstalled.  I've tried all this in WIn10 safe mode as well but still no joy. </p><p>The issue seems to be that there is a process running that cannot be terminated but I'm unable to kill the single remaining Firefox.exe process listed in task manager.  When I try 'taskkilll /IM firefox.exe /F' from the command prompt I get an error that the process can't be killed as an instance of it does not exist.  If I try 'taskkill /IM firefox.exe /T /F' it advises that a child process is keeping the main process alive - explorer.exe.  Terminating explorer.exe does not free up the firefox.exe process for termination (same error of the instance not existing).  The only way to clear the process is to reboot my system, Firefox will then start ok but when closed the issue will occur again. </p><p>I'm on my 4th clean install and the issue persists, so any help or advice beyond what I've tried would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-700;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1265536;1266489;1266497;1266534;1267119;1282737;1299488;,ghenjei,"id:1299488,created:2020-03-22 15:13:08 -0800,updated:2020-03-22 15:13:08 -0800,creator:Loc_rabbirt,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Seem none of the solution resolve this problem, I have this problem too and I can't get rid of it. </p> id:1282737,created:2020-01-19 16:56:40 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 16:56:40 -0800,creator:Ace00086T,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Only thing I can add to the above is that that I see five firefox processes under ""Details"" of Task Manager.

That's the way that it's worked for me. </p> id:1265260,created:2019-11-07 18:46:08 -0800,updated:2019-11-07 18:46:08 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Sync is short for synchronize - ""make the same"".

I wonder if one of those services is running Firefox for iOS or Firefox for Android? <em>Dozens of support threads around here about ""duplicated bookmarks / folders"" issues connected to Mobile Firefox &amp; Sync.</em> </p><p>On Desktop / Laptop Firefox open Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information and way down that display at Places Database use the <strong>Verify Integrity</strong> button.

Some changes - deletions / additions - get sent to the Sync server immediately but if you are doing multiple deletions / additions Sync seems (to me) to switch to a ""batch mode"" where the changes are saved  and then sent to the server as a ""batch"". <em>Although that may have changed recently, I haven't tested those actions in the last few years.</em> </p><p>As far as <strong>""I have two devices and device #1 is the way I want both.""</strong> The user has no control of how or which way data gets 'synced'; data is merged on the Sync server and all devices carry equal weight, there is no ""primary device"" with Firefox Sync. <em>But on Mobile iOS / Android bookmarks saved on Mobile are treated a bit differently on the server and will appear in a ""Mobile"" folder on Laptop / Desktop Firefox installations.</em> </p> id:1265247,created:2019-11-07 17:37:19 -0800,updated:2019-11-07 17:37:19 -0800,creator:wurfsendungen1,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I'm not sure about that.

I can't find any actual history of this URL in the History library. Am I missing something, or does the History feature record only the last access? This would be very bad and a far cry from any kind of history. Also, the Search feature does not seem to take into account the range of dates selected in the left pane. For instance, if I select ""September"" and search for my URL, it returns the URL that I accessed in November and that didn't even exist in September.

On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'. </p><p>Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version. </p><p>Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like <a href=""https://pinoychannelreplay.su/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pinoychannelreplay.su/</a> to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above. </p><p>Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete. </p>"

1272374,2019-11-06 04:20:20 -0800,2019-11-06T13:10:14Z,How to fix password saving exceptions for good?,"<p>Hello! I am running out of ideas.  </p><p>I do the IT support for my dad (85+ years):  Firefox 70.0.1 64 bit on Windows 10 Home 64 bit, all up to date. He has various passwords saved in FF, but I specifically instructed FF to exempt the sites he uses for Online Banking sites from saving passwords.  </p><pre>  ""Access &amp; Passwords"" &gt; Exceptions: sites listed (entered by clicking ""NEVER save"" when asked on login).  </pre> <p>I have FF delete all data upon closure:  </p><pre>  ""Delete history when FF is closed"" all EXCEPT for ""Website Settings"" (which I learned would also kill the password save barrier) </pre> <p>Now, I don't know what my dad does; every time I check after a week these settings are gone and FF is happily back, offering the saved login details to his Online Banking sites, also the Exception list is empty. My dad cannot say what he did to change this and maintains ""he didn't do anything"" (see also: typical IT support customer statements).  Sometimes I find he has even reinstalled FF for no good reason (which I can see in the Apps bar). But this should not affect the Profile settings, and even if he should have agreed to delete profile data: the bookmarks are still there, so it's not all gone.  </p><p>For now I have deactivated FF from saving any passwords, which is the safe choice when Online Banking is involved (no, my dad won't agree to close the Online Banking Account altogether go to the bank). But this creates new problems with all the other less sensitive sites where he needs to enter passwords (newspaper sites etc.), which he misplaces and keeps on resetting them (to passwords which he will again not remember the next time round).  </p><p>My next thought was to set permissions.sqlite to read-only, as I found this is where FF stores the exception list. Unfortunately, I realized that FF apparently updates this file every time it's run and ignores it if it finds it is out of sync with what it expects, returning to the clear sheet. So this doesn't help.  </p><p>I guess I could set up an autorun batch file to delete the profile directory and restore a golden reference directory, but this could be error-prone too.  </p><p>So I was wondering if the community can point me to a way to permanently fix a given list of Password-Save-Exceptions which cannot be altered by the user? Something like a config setting, available or hidden?  </p><p>Thanks for any advice or pointers, Akebinko </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-700;firefox-7001;,firefox,customize,en-US,1264778;1264782;1264826;1264859;1264878;1264895;1264896;1264901;1264904;1264915;,Akebinko,"id:1264915,created:2019-11-06 13:10:14 -0800,updated:2019-11-06 13:10:14 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It is possible to hide the button to open the exception window with code in userContent.css. </p> <pre>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:preferences) {  #passwordExceptions { display:none !important; } }</pre> <hr> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/what-is-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/what-is-userchrome-css.html</a> </li><li><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </li></ul> <p>In Firefox 69 and later you need to set this pref to true on the <b>about:config</b> page to enable userChrome.css and userContent.css in the chrome folder. </p> <ul><li>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true </li><li><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-changes-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-changes-userchrome-css.html</a> </li></ul> <p>Note that you can set this pref via autoconfig.cfg. </p> <ul><li>lockpref(""toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets"", true); </li></ul> id:1264904,created:2019-11-06 12:44:32 -0800,updated:2019-11-06 12:44:32 -0800,creator:Akebinko,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi cor-el!  </p><p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1264895"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Is this only about block exceptions for specific hosts (domains) and do you want to allow storing passwords for other domains? </blockquote> <p>exactly!  </p><p>Thanks for the pointer to autoconfig.

This could apply e.g. if I chose to reinstall FF on every startup (rather than simply copy a profile from backup) and have FF build the profile with profile settings defined by these policies. I think this solution is even more complex.  </p><p>Also, only a fraction of these policies are usable for the 70.x release. Of course I can revert to 68esr (which I myself use on my own PC to leave the multiple addons I choose to use a bit more time to live before yet another FF release change disables them) but even then most policy entries stop at 60.  </p><p>OfferToSaveLogins only works up to FF 60. The closest I can find with respect to my task is OfferToSaveLoginsDefault (up to 70), but I assume this will only switch Logins to On and Off and they can still be changed later on. I am confident that my switching off password saving manually will do the trick fro now, since I don't trust my dad to venture into settings-land.  </p><p>I hoped there was a hidden config key which I could use in a similar way in Firefox as I can use a registry key in Windows 10 to lock the Windows 10 task tray and prevent my dad from pushing that around (<a href=""http://www.winfaq.de/faq_html/Content/tip1000/onlinefaq.php?h=tip1438.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">URL to a German webpage on the matter</a> ) .  </p><p>Regards, Akebinko </p> id:1264895,created:2019-11-06 12:31:52 -0800,updated:2019-11-06 12:31:52 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Is this only about block exceptions for specific hosts (domains) and do you want to allow storing passwords for other domains? </p><p>I don't think that it is possible to lock exceptions, so even if you would force an exception when you start Firefox it would still be possible to go to the exception manager window and remove the exception or clear the Site Preferences via ""Clear Recent History"". </p> <hr> <p>See: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-autoconfig"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-autoconfig</a> </li></ul> <p>Note that you need to disable the sandbox via autoconfig.js to be able to run JavaScript. </p> <pre>// autoconfig.js needs to start with a comment line and uses Unix line endings (LF) pref(""general.config.filename"", ""autoconfig.cfg""); pref(""general.config.obscure_value"", 0); pref(""general.config.sandbox_enabled"", false); </pre> <hr> <pre>// autoconfig.cfg needs to start with a comment line Components.utils.import(""resource://gre/modules/Services.jsm""); var origin = ""<a href=""https://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com</a>""; Services.logins.setLoginSavingEnabled(origin, false); </pre> id:1264878,created:2019-11-06 11:52:17 -0800,updated:2019-11-06 11:52:17 -0800,creator:TyDraniu,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Maybe these would be helpful:  </p><p><a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates#passwordmanagerenabled"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates#passwordmanagerenabled</a> <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates#offertosavelogins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates#offertosavelogins</a> </p> id:1264859,created:2019-11-06 11:08:56 -0800,updated:2019-11-06 11:08:56 -0800,creator:Akebinko,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>FredMcD,  </p><p>ss I wrote: he claims he did nothing of the sort.  </p><p>And I don't think he goes into the settings.

After browsing for a while when I open a new tab and try to load a web page large parts of Firefox become unresponsive, for example I can close other tabs, move tabs, use websites in other Firefox windows largely unaffected but I cannot view other tabs in the window I opened the crashing tab. The unresponsive tab just sits there with a loading animation in the tab name, white screen, what ever website I tried to visit cleared from the address bar. </p><p>Opening additional tabs is possible but the crashing window will not switch to those tabs, while in another window I can open a new tab but actually visiting a site or opening a link in a new tab will crash that window.  </p><p>Opening new windows once I'm crashing results in a crashed window regardless if I use the empty page or load a URL. </p><p>Lastly if I click on a link before a tab crashes nothing will happen. No tab will open, no tabs will crash, the link won't turn purple. But at this point I can go fully about my business reading the existing loaded content in all my working tabs and windows. Opening the link in a new tab with context menus will crash the new tab immediately. </p><p>Once a tab has crashed I am forced to close the browser. It usually takes a while to fully shutdown, but it's never unresponsive enough to need to be killed in the Task Manager. </p><p>And sometimes this entire process corrupts my profile and I get to re-login to everything on the web again. </p><p>Now, here's the frustrating part. I don't know how to troubleshoot this. The issue has persisted through: - Firefox versions 67, 68, and 70 - My machine was re-imaged with a new Windows image when I was upgraded to an SSD. The previous image didn't have Firefox preinstalled, the new image did(68). I purged that and installed 70 and the issue continues. - I have disabled hardware acceleration multiple times(because my profile keeps getting reset). - There are no crash logs. - I haven't taken to time to reproduce the error with no extensions but I've A/B tested that I can crash running just uBlock or just Tusk. I'm not running a lot of extensions because the profile keeps getting reset. - Firefox isn't actually crashing, no crash reports are being generated, Windows event log is clean. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1264576;1267387;,ohagandavid,"id:1267387,created:2019-11-18 12:40:29 -0800,updated:2019-11-18 12:40:29 -0800,creator:ohagandavid,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Found out I was in an old group in the organization that was being pushed Firefox ESR for testing.

There has GOT to be a better answer. It's been too many years of this making excuses. </p><p>If nothing else, can't someone develop JUST a rinky dinky program/add-in that loops through all open pages one by one, closing, pausing while we check Taskman, then reopening so we can see the effect? That would be TRIVIAL for someone to write just that crude thing. But it would save people breathtaking amounts of time because we're having to do this manually, over and over and over and over and over. Even with this simple routine, it could be enhanced to record the CPU load from Taskman or TaskInfo or something, since we'd be slowly, ploddingly writing down or pasting the results as I stepped through the pages one by one. </p><p>Better yet, ideally, just do this, which also should not be technically difficult - seriously. Take some unused field and populate it with identifying information (like the Save As name of the page), then inform Microsoft (for taskman, resmon) and Iars (for TaskInfo) where it is.

An indication of which browser instances go with which PIDs. Even if there's some overlap, if PID 6632 is using an entire core and more of my desktop, if I can just even partially limit which browser windows are burning there, that would be enormous. </p> <pre>For example PID....FX-ID 15......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"") 15......mozilla.com / (name of page, ... 15.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ... 15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 25......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"") 25.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ... 33.....ameritrade.com / (name of page, ... 33.....yahoo.finance / (name of page, ... 33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ... 33.....goduckgo.com / (name of page, ... etc.</pre> <p>If the reason no one's done this is because there's more than one page associated with each PID, that's covered in the listing above.

I have a very well equipped desktop but it is hammered by one or more such sites. I and I am sure others have wasted hours and hours and hours hunting and pecking to diagnose this, and there's NO END to it, because there will continue to be piss poor webpages that suck CPU and disk. Even from <a href=""http://microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">microsoft.com</a>, as you surely know to be often the worst performers of all. I use NoScript but that is not perfect; you have to continuously adjust it for different sites, and you don't know WHICH sites need to be throttled down. It's wildly inefficient when we're shooting in the dark, because we DON'T KNOW WHICH BROWSER WINDOW is the jerkoff. </p><p>BTW I have many WINDOWS open - almost never tabs. It is almost always massively more efficient than using tabs when you have many. Namely, with windows I can use Windows' own alt-tab, or click or hover the taskbar to navigate. </p><p>I volunteer a lot of my time, a lot, both in technical areas and in personal charity. I'd do this myself, but I have no browser or HTML development background. Can't someone please come up with something? Asking for the millionth time, please? Sorry I'm getting nasty but there's all this senseless massive waste of time, and it will never go away - unless you heroically answer the call. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-690;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1264525;1264526;1264658;,GatesIsAntiChrist,"id:1264658,created:2019-11-05 19:31:08 -0800,updated:2019-11-05 19:31:08 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Are you familiar with the Firefox Task Manager ? </p><p>You can check the Firefox Task Manager (about:performance) and about:memory pages. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/task-manager-tabs-or-extensions-are-slowing-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/task-manager-tabs-or-extensions-are-slowing-firefox</a> </li></ul> id:1264526,created:2019-11-05 10:17:32 -0800,updated:2019-11-05 10:18:29 -0800,creator:GatesIsAntiChrist,updated_by:GatesIsAntiChrist,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I can't edit now, but what I was trying to show atop is redone here, with linefeeds fixed (FYI, appending spaces at each EOL) PID....FX-ID   15......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")   15......mozilla.com / (name of page, ...   15.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...   15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   25......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")   25.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...   33.....ameritrade.com / (name of page, ...   33.....yahoo.finance / (name of page, ...   33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...   33.....goduckgo.com / (name of page, ... </p> id:1264525,created:2019-11-05 10:12:50 -0800,updated:2019-11-05 10:12:50 -0800,creator:GatesIsAntiChrist,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>At this moment one of the 9 or so firefox.exe instances is taking 20% of CPU.

Have used it for quite a while and no problems printing either from online or from a desktop application. I am constantly printing PDFs from online -- e.g., receipts of bills paid, articles to do with my work, etc. In past, when I print a new PDF, it automatically opens, just like when printing from within desktop applications. This is a very necessary step in my work because of the volume that I print. I've been doing this for YEARS, and it has always worked. Now, suddenly, the PDFs no longer open upon printing from online (printing from desktop apps still works as expected). I have not personally changed any settings in either Firefox or Acrobat DC. But something must be different. Is it a glitch due to a Firefox update? Or could something have changed a setting for me?   </p><p>As I said, I do a lot of my printing in volume, so this is becoming very frustrating as it means every time I print to PDF from online, I have to leave Firefox and go find the particular folder and make any necessary notations (or even just make sure the PDF created at all, before I dare leave the web site I've just printed from), vs. having the PDF right there in front of me immediately as has always been the case for years in the past. </p><p>I've already posted to the Adobe forum, and no help has hit the money spot as yet.

O Outro problema grave é que com a instalação sozinha feita pelo Windows 10, tudo que estava configurado no Firefox (Página Inicial, favoritos, Barra de Menu, Segurança de senha, etc) desaparece. Tenho que configurar o navegador Firefox tudo novamente.  Por favor, alguém pode me ajudar como resolver e inibir que o Windows faça essas alterações no meu PC? Geralmente, essas atualizações acontecem quando eu ligo o PC.  Inclusive, quando eu coloco algum bloqueador, o PC fica sem ligar as vezes, até que seja instalado todas as atualizações que o Windows 10 quer... Eu já pensei que fosse problema com fonte, memória, ou coisa do tipo.. mas não é. Um absurdo isso que o Windows está fazendo..

Not with the Delete function on any menu, and not by dragging off the Bookmarks Menu list in Library to the sidebar (which used to work). I have used Cookie5 (now disabled), which bloggers say corrupts places.sqlite. I have tried these things:  I deleted the places file and restarted. This wiped bookmarks but not their folders. 2. I went to Time Machine and replaced current places file with older ones. Bookmarks returned but still no delete option. 3. I tried to restore bookmarks from backups. All JSON backups must be corrupted, because none will open. And the Export and Backup functions do not work either. 4. I checked Places Database to Verify Integrity. No solution there, but readout is below. 5. I tried to create a new profile, set up an account and tried to sync. No luck. So I copied an older places.sqlite file into the new Profile: the bookmarks were there, but in the new profile the problem of deleting them remained. I am stumped. </p><p>Readout: &gt; Task: checkIntegrity - Unable to check places.sqlite integrity: Error: Error(s) encountered during statement execution: database disk image is malformed &gt; Task: invalidateCaches - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: checkCoherence - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: expire - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: originFrecencyStats - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: vacuum - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: stats - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: _refreshUI </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-700;firefox-7001;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1264205;1264210;1264254;1264273;,makipper,"id:1264273,created:2019-11-04 15:10:28 -0800,updated:2019-11-04 15:10:28 -0800,creator:makipper,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you!

It's how you can use the Restore Previous Session feature, or why tabs are offered for restore when FF crashes. Sometimes a BSOD can wreak havoc in the way it kills the system, especially certain kinds of BSOD (like the hardware or driver ones that just strangle Windows, versus the ones where Windows just thought it might be a good idea to BSOD to stop anything worse happening).  </p><p>I don't know how FF handles all of its I/O, but the only thing that might help is less lazy writing, if any, but that is as much on the OS as any application. And things going wrong leading up to BSOD may just interfere with flushing data to disk properly. If a tab is crashing, or crashes happen while loading or closing a tab, that would certainly be a good candidate for causing no session to be recovered, if happening while FF is writing the changes when everything goes sideways. </p><p>I'm sure that when the developers get things more settled with the major re-write FF is going through, they will beef up the handling of edge cases and other perennial issues like printing. </p> id:1287086,created:2020-02-04 07:51:38 -0800,updated:2020-02-04 07:51:38 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi battles_atlas, Firefox stores open tabs to a second file during your session to provide protection against corruption of the main file.

A mistake when translating red panda from Chinese to English is how we got firefox. The composition of the logo has not changed since 2004: a red panda encircling a blue globe representing the earth. Since it had been 15 years since Mozilla Firefox had had a major overhaul of its image, the company decided in 2018 to test the waters. They decided to show different options of their new design. They do not just want to change their main logo but also create a whole new family of icons consistent with the brand. This last point was Slack’s main argument during their redesign earlier this year. </p><p>Two designs have been shown to the public so far and they are very promising. Once again we find it a minimalist appearance with warm colors. We should know more about this redesign very soon, at least we hope! </p><p>UPDATE JUNE 13TH. 2019 </p><p>The new logo has been revealed!

I got a message that due to changes in Firefox the Firefox profile cannot be used anymore. Then I copied the profile folder manually and checked profiles.ini, but no way. I found an Firefox help article how to copy several files manually to the new profile (""Recovering important data from an old profile""). This seems to be a workaround, but I'm not sure if it restores the Firefox profile completely, and it is unexpected additional work to complete the Windows Restore.  So my questions:  Is there an easier way to get the restored Firefox profile running? Firefox synchronization is not allowed due to company policies.  What is the technical reason for not accepting copied profiles anymore?

This includes deleting or moving the folder bookmarkbackups and the <a href=""http://bookmarks.xxx"" rel=""nofollow"">bookmarks.xxx</a> files in the Firefox profile folder. </p><p>A restart of Firefox revealed that all bookmarks were finally gone. It was also possible to delete and move the default bookmarks in Firefox. The last step was to import the bookmarks from the backup that was created at the beginning and move them into their correct places again. </p><p>To import bookmarks into Firefox, open the Bookmarks Manager with a click on the Firefox button and the selection of Bookmarks from the menu. In the manager, click on import and backup and select import bookmarks from HTML from the list. You can alternatively import them from another web browser if you are syncing your bookmarks across browsers. </p><p>A test to delete and move those imported bookmarks was positive and solved the issue of being not able to delete Firefox 3 bookmarks. </p>"

It would sometimes just vanish from the desktop, taking with it anything I happened to be typing into a browser window - forums, Facebook comment threads, anything. There are no error messages before or after or when I open the program again.  It just vanishes without warning.  </p><p>I have had different ISPs, different computers, different OS's, and it ALWAYS does this. Days go by in between, sometimes just hours, but it's always done it. I switched to Safari for a while but I still like Firefox, so I came back, rationalizing that surely after many updates and months it must have been fixed. There is literally nothing the same on my current system - the OS is the latest. I use different software packages than I used to. The current Firefox installation is updated and running. And yet, it still just - vanishes. Randomly. No errors apparent. Nothing in the logs. </p><p>The only thing in common over the years has been me - I'm just browsing the internet and using stuff. I have no idea what this could be. </p><p>Before I abandon Firefox entirely I thought I would ask - is there something I am missing here? What the heck is going on that it keeps doing this to me? I don't have stray seizures that strike the command key and Q - my hardware works fine and the batteries in the keyboard are fresh, my aura doesn't disrupt other electronics, I don't have other people using my system, I've refreshed Firefox and scanned for viruses and malware and gremlins and pixies - what else can I possibly do to fix this randomly disappearing browser window issue? The entire program just quits and all the windows go away. POOF. If I restart it pops right back to the windows I was using and restarts, only without whatever I was typing at the time it vanished. It's the only software that does this to me.  </p><p>It did it once while I was typing this on the support site.  </p><p>Help? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-700;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1263772;1263783;1263789;1263813;1265134;1265763;,lorister,"id:1265763,created:2019-11-10 07:04:38 -0800,updated:2019-11-10 07:04:38 -0800,creator:lorister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have established that it is not Time Machine.

The drive I currently have, a Seagate, just woke up while I was typing this and nothing happened, so it seems to me that Time Machine may be part of the problem. </p><p>I'm going to play with the backup schedule and see what happens.

The problem is worse on the smaller system due to delays as add ons update and new tab opens. These get in my way and interfere with my business. Chrome is just as bad with this. Make these add ons better behaved. Show an indicator on the three bar menu icon, which already shows permission changes. I will get to it when free.  I want to choose when to view update info, and would be happy with a short update message with links to more info. Also would like to designate time of day or weekday that<strong>bold text</strong> Add Ons are allowed to update. Or have just one tab opened in the background where all such update messages appear.

But let get the record straight. User-Agent sniffing is a future fail strategy. By design, you will detect only what is known, not what will come. The space of small devices (smartphones, feature phones, tablets, watches, arduino, etc.) is a very fast-paced evolving space. The diversity in terms of physical characteristics will only increase. Updating databases and algorithms for identifying correctly is a very high maintenance task which is doomed to fail at a point in the future. Sites get abandoned, libraries are not maintained and Web sites will break just because they were not planned for the future coming devices. All of these have costs in resources and branding. </p><p>New solutions are being developed for helping people to adjust the user experience depending on the capabilities of the products, not its name. Responsive design helps to create Web sites that are adjusting for different screen sizes. Each time you detect a product or a feature, it is important to thoroughly understand why you are trying to detect this feature. You could fall in the same traps as the ones existing with user agent detection algorithms. </p><p>We have to deal on a daily basis with abusive user agent detection blocking Firefox OS and/or Firefox on Android. It is not only Mozilla products, every product and brand has to deal at a point with the fact to be excluded because they didn’t have the right token to pass an ill-coded algorithm. User agent detection leads to situation where a new player can hardly enter the market even if it has the right set of technologies. Remember that there are huge benefits to create a system which is resilient to many situations. </p><p>Some companies will be using the User-Agent string as an identifier for bypassing a pay-wall or offering specific content for a group of users during a marketing campaign. It seems to be an easy solution at first but it creates an environment easy to by-pass in spoofing the user agent. </p>"

I suspected these are simply the empty starting page and using a third party website to inspect the contents trhe suspicion turned out to be correct. </p><p>So, what I'm wondering is are there any other older backup files saved anywhere in the FF folders that could be used instead? I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups. And further, is it possible to recover all those tabs and windows somehow if the only backup files are blank as I discovered?

In Windows 8.1 and 10, you might need to click the ""More details"" link at the bottom of the Task Manager to see it. Click here for more Task Manager tricks that you should know. </p><p>Start using your computer as normal, but keep an eye on the CPU, memory and disk categories. If the computer freezes, and one of these is really high, then that could be your answer. Make a note of which area was really high then restart the computer and open Task Manager again. </p><p>This time, however, choose the ""Processes"" tab. Sort the list by CPU, memory or disk, whichever was really high last time the computer froze, and see what process pops up to the top of the list as the computer freezes. This should tell you what software is acting up so you can uninstall or update it. Learn how to unravel what processes tell you about your programs. </p><p>You might also have hidden software, such as a virus, causing problems. Be sure to run a scan with your security software to uncover something that shouldn't be there. </p><p>In cases where your computer freezes during startup in normal mode, but boots OK in Safe Mode, the problem could be a program that's loading during the boot sequence. Use a program like Autoruns to selectively disable the programs that begin at startup and see which one is causing the problem. </p><p>If your computer is freezing during startup no matter what, and it's at the same point, then the problem could be corruption in Windows, or a hardware problem. A quick way to tell is to grab a Live CD for another operating system, such as Linux Mint or Tails, and boot with that. </p><p>If the other operating system boots OK, then you're probably looking at a problem with Windows and might need to reinstall. For those using Windows 10 (and 8), it has a Refresh/Reset feature that's supposed to return Windows to a factory state. It's under Settings&gt;&gt;Update and recovery&gt;&gt;Recovery. If Windows is having trouble starting, it should pop up a Recovery option during boot that includes this, or you might have to use a disc. </p><p>If the non-Windows operating system has trouble too, then it's time to look at your hardware. </p><p><br> </p><p>~Basic hardware troubleshooting~ </p><p>A computer that freezes both in normal mode and Safe Mode, or with another operating system, can often indicate a problem with your computer's hardware. It could be your hard drive, an overheating CPU, bad memory or a failing power supply. In some cases, it might also be your motherboard, although that's a rare occurrence. </p><p>Usually with hardware problem, the freezing will start out sporadic, but increase in frequency as time goes on. Or it will trigger when the computer is working hard, but not when you're doing more basic things. Fortunately, you can run some checks and see if that's the case. </p><p>Use a program like CrystalDiskInfo to check your hard drive's S.M.A.R.T. data for signs of impending failure. A program like SpeedFan can tell you if your computer processor is overheating, or if the voltages are fluctuating, which might be a problematic power supply. </p><p>If you want to go more in-depth, you can grab a diagnostic CD like FalconFour's Ultimate Boot CD. It has plenty of other tools for checking out your computer, including MemTest for putting strain on your computer's RAM to see if it's working OK. </p><p>Learn about more signs that your computer could be close to dying. If your computer is newer, it might still be under warranty, in which case you'll want to contact the manufacturer or seller. </p><p>For an older computer, you need to decide if it's less expensive to repair or replace it.

You can do this in one of two ways. </p><pre>   1.Open a Finder window and navigate to Home Directory/Library/Safari. </pre> <pre>   2.Hold down the option key and drag the Bookmarks.plist file to another location. By holding down the option key, you ensure that a copy is made and that the original stays in the default location. </pre> <p>The alternate way to back up the Bookmarks.plist file is to right-click the file and select Compress ""Bookmarks.plist from the pop-up menu. This will create a file named Bookmarks.plist.zip, which you can move anywhere on your Mac without affecting the original. Restoring Your Safari Bookmarks </p><p>All you need to restore your Safari bookmarks is to have a backup of the Bookmarks.plist file available. If the backup is in the compressed or zip format, you will need to double-click the Bookmarks.plist.zip file to decompress it first. </p><pre>   1.Quit Safari if the application is open. </pre> <pre>   2.Copy the Bookmarks.plist file you backed up earlier to Home Directory/Library/Safari. </pre> <pre>   3.A warning message will display: ""An item named ""Bookmarks.plist"" already exists in this location. Do you want to replace it with the one you're moving?"" Click the Replace button. </pre> <pre>   4.Once you restore the Bookmarks.plist file, you can launch Safari. All your bookmarks will be present, just where they were when you backed them up. No importing and sorting required. </pre> <pre>Moving Safari Bookmarks to a New Mac </pre> <p>Moving your Safari bookmarks to a new Mac is conceptually the same as restoring them. The only difference is you will need a way to bring the Bookmarks.plist file to your new Mac. </p><p>Because of the Bookmarks.plist file is small, you can easily email it to yourself. Other options are to move the file across a network, put it on a USB flash drive or an external hard drive, or store it in the cloud, on an Internet-based storage solution such as Apple's iCloud drive. Our preference is a USB flash drive because we can take it with us everywhere and access our Safari bookmarks whenever we need them. </p><p>Once you have the Bookmarks.plist file on your new Mac, use the steps outlined in 'Restoring Your Safari Bookmarks,' above, to make your bookmarks available. </p><p><br> </p><pre>Using Safari Bookmarks on Other Macs or PCs </pre> <p>If you travel a lot, or you like to visit friends or family and use their Mac or PC while you're there, you may want to bring along your Safari bookmarks. There are multiple ways to do this; one method we won't go into is to store your bookmarks in the cloud, so you can access them from anywhere you have an Internet connection. </p><p>We started out by disparaging Safari's import/export capabilities, but there is one time when the export function is quite useful. That's when you need to access your bookmarks from a public computer, such as those found at libraries, business locations, or coffee houses. </p><p>When you use Safari's Export Bookmarks option, the file Safari creates is actually an HTML listing of all of your bookmarks. You can take this file with you and open it in any browser, just like a normal web page. Of course, you don't end up with bookmarks per se; instead, you end up with a web page that has a clickable list of all of your bookmarks. Though not as easy to use as the bookmarks in a browser, the list can still come in handy when you're on the road. </p><p>Here's how to export your bookmarks. </p><pre>   1.Launch Safari. </pre> <pre>   2.Select File &gt; Export Bookmarks. </pre> <pre>   <a href=""http://3.In"" rel=""nofollow"">3.In</a> the Save dialog window that opens, select a target location for the Safari Bookmarks.html file, and then click the Save button. </pre> <pre>   4.Copy the Safari Bookmarks.html file to a USB flash drive or to a cloud storage system. </pre> <pre>   <a href=""http://5.To"" rel=""nofollow"">5.To</a> use the Safari Bookmarks.html file, open a browser on the computer you're using and either drag the Safari Bookmarks.html file to the browser's address bar or select Open from the browser's file menu and navigate to the Safari Bookmarks.html file. </pre> <pre>   6.Your list of Safari Bookmarks will display as a web page. To visit one of your bookmarked sites, just click the corresponding link. </pre> id:1263493,created:2019-11-02 12:02:09 -0800,updated:2019-11-02 12:02:09 -0800,creator:Chris_Ilias,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I recommend you use the Firefox Sync feature.

That scheme also allows the user to clear data from the Sync server should the need for a fresh start arise. <em>Ten years ago I had corrupt data issues with Sync, and I almost ran out of email addresses when creating additional new accounts to get to the bottom of my problem. That was with the 1st version of Sync before it became built into Firefox; the Weave extension which was used to develop Sync. The 1.1 version with a ""recovery code"" feature came about 3 months prior to Sync being in to Firefox 4.0; that ""code"" provided the needed ""data clear"" feature and provided slightly better encryption for Firefox user data.</em> </p>"

This functionality works fine on FireFox itself (Menus, bookmark bar, tab bars etc) but moving to the webpages displayed nothing happens.   I know its not the pages themselves as I've opened the exact pages in all three browsers and this feature works in Chrome and Safari but it doesn't on FF. </p><p>Is there some way to enable this feature for FF?  I really want to use FF for the priviacy but I have some difficulty with my vision at times and really need this to work.  I know that I can increase the font size of the entire window and I've done that but this functionality is what I really need.  In the attachments you can see in FF it works on the bookmark ""most visited"" and in Safari the text boxed in red is part of the page, I was trying to do that on the first attachemnt in FF but you can see there is no text magnification on the page itself. </p><p>Any help greatly appreciated!! </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-700;,firefox,other,en-US,1263372;1263378;1263431;1263567;,junkmailcw+FF,"id:1263567,created:2019-11-02 14:30:34 -0800,updated:2019-11-02 14:30:34 -0800,creator:junkmailcw+FF,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>thanks for the feedback....yes Accessibility services are enabled in Firefox preferences. </p> id:1263431,created:2019-11-02 10:17:54 -0800,updated:2019-11-02 10:17:54 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi Chris, Catalina seems to be really new.

Typically, this would happen when reading webpage articles in Safari.    -When pressing Command Shift D to send a message in Mail, VoiceOver now correctly speaks the action as, ""Send.""    -When going back a page in Safari, VoiceOver more consistently returns to the same point.    -When navigating a webpage in Safari Reader, there is no longer a vertical scrollbar, and if you have curser wrapping disabled, pressing VO Left Arrow will, as expected, not wrap around to the bottom of the page.    -VoiceOver no longer announces, ""System Preferences has new window"" when navigating certain preference panes.    -VoiceOver should no longer occasionally behave as though it were disabled when interacting with the Touch Bar on certain Macs    -the address bar in Safari should behave better, with VoiceOver no longer announcing incorrect characters when you delete text. </pre>"

I've tried everything. </p><p>I’m using a desktop; Dell; newer. Windows 10; 1903; plenty of speed and space left. No viruses, etc.; have done many scans (malwarebytes, adware, etc.)  </p><p>For whatever reason (I think I incorrectly shut down Firefox and/or my computer, and that was the beginning of the problem), Firefox is causing lot of issues. </p><p>Won’t open or close. followed all the advice on this site. </p><p>Found out on this site to try ending Firefox in task manager; when that didn’t work; went in to and deleted parent.lock from the profile. </p><p>Then rebooted the computer; still wouldn’t open (or did once, but then had the same problem?) Tried shutting off the computer and restarting rather than rebooting many times during all this process as well. </p><p>I followed what someone said about adding the word OLD after places.sqlite. So in the original profile folder I have: </p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD     places.sqlite-shmOLD     places.sqlite-walOLD </pre> <p>that didn’t help things. Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’ </p><p>So I have: </p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD       prefs-1jsOLD       prefs-2.jsOLD       prefs-3.jsOLD                   Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them </pre> <p>That didn’t help. </p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop. Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it. </p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’). </p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile.  Same issues. Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again. Rebooted. </p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open). </p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox). I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; ….. </p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile! </p><p>The ‘default-release’ profile and the brand new one I created were never changed or touched; never added the word OLD to anything in there; made no changes. </p><p>So Firefox wouldn’t close; so I had to do all of the above again (try to end task in task manager; delete parent.lock, and reboot). </p><p>So now I’m at my wits end!!! </p><p>I can’t find anything left to try.  : ( </p><p>I hope someone can help! </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1263270;1263376;1263757;1263759;1263782;1263836;1263851;1263852;1263854;1263856;1263857;1263860;1263861;1263863;1263868;1263885;1263888;1263987;1264052;1264271;1264275;1264287;1264292;1264302;1264566;1264798;1265232;1265244;1265804;1265807;1265839;1265843;1265873;1265899;1266013;1266016;1266030;1266050;1266053;1266055;1266060;1266089;1266310;1266336;1266450;1266487;1266492;1266498;1266977;1266981;1272939;1272941;1272972;1272982;,denise3,"id:1272982,created:2019-12-12 10:13:42 -0800,updated:2019-12-12 10:13:42 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>The full installer is also required if you want to install a different Firefox locale like the en-US locale on a not English Windows version. </p> id:1272972,created:2019-12-12 09:49:56 -0800,updated:2019-12-12 09:49:56 -0800,creator:denise3,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>oh! thanks so much : ) </p> id:1272941,created:2019-12-12 08:16:27 -0800,updated:2019-12-12 08:16:27 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>FirefoxHelpPlease <a href=""#answer-1272939"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> so if the 'small program' not the full installer knows which to install on a 64 bit machine; then why would anyone need or use the 'full installer'? just curious. </blockquote> <p>The full installer is useful if: </p> <ul><li> your firewall/security software doesn't allow stub installers to download executables (the small installer repeatedly reports an error connecting) </li><li> you want to do a custom install in a different program folder (see: <a href=""/en-US/kb/custom-installation-firefox-on-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">Custom installation of Firefox on Windows</a>) </li><li> you need to put the installer on a USB flash drive to help a friend with a slow connection </li></ul> id:1272939,created:2019-12-12 07:54:52 -0800,updated:2019-12-12 07:54:52 -0800,creator:denise3,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>so if the 'small program' not the full installer knows which to install on a 64 bit machine; then why would anyone need or use the 'full installer'? just curious. thanks! </p> id:1266981,created:2019-11-16 07:50:59 -0800,updated:2019-11-16 07:50:59 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>FirefoxHelpPlease <a href=""#answer-1266977"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> oh!

I usually end up just closing F/F and restarting it, which fixes the issue. This has been a problem for a long time (years) on my Mac, and has persisted through many versions of macOS and F/F, but it seems to be getting worse with each new version of F/F. I have tried doing a ""Refresh"" of Firefox, but that didn't help.

If it turns out that the Mac machine is frozen, you’ll probably have to do a hard reboot by pressing the power button – holding it for three seconds, then press it again to restart your Mac. </p><p>Step 2: Open Firefox browser and check the version. </p><p>Click the Firefox icon on top left corner, you’ll see “About Firefox”. Click on it and a window will pop up showing you the current version you are using. If it’s not up to date, update it right away </p><p><br> Step 3: Lighten your browser. </p><p>You can do so by: </p><pre>   Clearing browsing history (Firefox Menu &gt; History &gt; Clean recent history)    Removing useless extensions (Firefox Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Extensions &amp; Themes &gt; Extensions)    Disabling unnecessary plugins (Firefox Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Extensions &amp; Themes &gt; Plugins) </pre> <p>Step 4: Clean your Mac hard drive. </p><p>You can do this manually, or save time by using a dedicated cleaning app like CleanMyMac X. It will help tune up your overall Mac performance, as well as making Firefox run more smoothly. </p><p>Step 5: Better web browsing habits. </p><p>Always try to open only one window, and close tabs/pages you don’t need to read, especially when you finish reading content in big magazine sites like Forbes, Huffington Post, MacWorld, etc. which I view as heavy sites because they usually load tons of video ads automatically. </p><p>Avoid multitasking at all cost. When you are using Firefox, close as many other apps as possible to squeeze more system resources (CPU, RAM) for Firefox. </p><p>Step 6: Switch to an alternative web browser. </p><p>Sometimes Firefox just doesn’t work well with certain versions of macOS, for example the previous El Capitan. Many Mac users have observed the performance issue. See more from this thread: Firefox not happy with El Capitan (Apple Discussions) </p><p>If Firefox is still running slow or freezing randomly, use an alternative like Google Chrome or Apple Safari though they sometimes act up too. </p><p>Anyway, we hope these steps have helped you speed up Firefox a little bit.
