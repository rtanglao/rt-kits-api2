In November 2018 I stopped receiving notifications and e-mails.  I   have re done my settings and gone through their troubleshooting system three times; each time their CSR assured me everything was fixed but  I still can not receive anything.  Nothing in the Foxfire troubleshooting section has addressed this issue. This is the only site that I have had a problem with. Do you have any suggestions? </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-650;,firefox,other,en-US,1201093;1201094;1201138;1201315;,gmzimmer

I'd like something like chromes AutoSelectCertificateForUrls that allows me to set a regex url pattern for cert selection without prompting the user that I can push a s a configuration to all enterprise users.

I'm having trouble figuring out how to describe the issue I'm having, and I'm not sure if I have all of the terminology correct. I've tried searching for others with similar issues and haven't found this particular problem. </p><p>The problem I am having occurs occasionally after waking from sleep. On some (but not all) windows, certain menu elements will render on top of my screen and will be unresponsive. For example, this most commonly occurs with the address bar drop down suggestions, but also occurs with permission boxes such as requesting location access. I believe I have also seen it happen with the downloads box (what comes up when clicking the down arrow, not the separate window that comes up with Ctrl+J). </p><p>When the problem occurs, these elements render on top of the screen and block anything behind them. They are also unresponsive to any input. They will persist in the same location on screen that they initially appeared, and will not move with the window if I move the window to another part of the screen. For example, the address bar takes up the full width of the screen when maximized. If the suggestions box gets stuck across the whole screen, then moving the window to fill half of the screen doesn't cause the stuck element to resize as well.  </p><p>These stuck elements are also specific to the particular Firefox window, and do not render over top of a separate window or other applications. It is also possible for them to stack, as I have had the suggestions box and a permissions box stuck simultaneously. </p><p>I can get them to go away a few ways. One is to re-activate the element, which allows me to interact with it normally, at which point it will disappear when it should. For example, if the address bar suggestions are stuck on top, I can start typing in the address bar. This causes new suggestions to pop up, at which point I can interact with it normally again, and it will disappear as it normally would (such as after selecting a suggestion or cancelling out). Sometimes this is more difficult, though, as in the example with the location permission box. I would have to go to a website that triggers that box to appear, at which point I can interact with it and close it by selecting either option on it. At this point it is easier to clear the stuck box the second way, which is to close and reopen the entire window. When the specific window that the UI element is tied to closes, it will also disappear. </p><p>I've noticed this occurs after putting my laptop to sleep and then waking it back up. It doesn't happen consistently, however, and I can't quite figure out what other conditions are necessary to replicate it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-650;bug1498973;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1200720;1200735;1201251;1201283;,waggy13

After downloading it and getting set up ,and telling my security programs to consider it a friend,  I noticed that Firefox loads a skeleton of a webpage, almost always . By skeleton , I mean very few pics, very few active links, just text. Blank spots where the thumbnails, links, and pics should be. Also on pages that do load and display photos, they disappear when the cursor is placed over them  . Some webpages are still useable, others are not, due to this swiss cheese effect.  Everything it decided to blank would fall into the ""potential threat"" category, so I did some reading, and experimented with clearing history , and unchecking the boxes blocking cookies and trackers, just to see if I could pinpoint the problem and allow the trusted sites or pages past it's filter. I had little success, and cannot really see myself living with the abbreviated versions of every webpage  , which I don't think is what the huge majority ofFirefox users are relegated to .

WTF? </p><p>Mozilla is giving out advice on how to memorize passwords instead of saving them in a password-manager. And at the same time Mozilla puts anti-features in the browser for the IT-department to disable my password-manager, that I became so dependent on? </p><p>You know where this leads: - I take the very same password everywhere now. - And because I have to type it every time: it's nice and short and - it happens to be found in an ordinary dictionary, as surprise the keyboard layout was designed, to support typing natural words. - Finally the last letter is a single digit, as I am forced to integrate a digit anyway, so why not let it be the last one - Oh how nice ... the reminder popped up to tell me, I have to change my password again ... so I add one to the counter, that happens to be so conveniently integrated into the password - Even, when I come across an old outdated account, I only need 10 tries, to crack my own password - I must recommend this as a fail-safe to all my colleagues! </p><p>Of course I cannot expect of you to answer my question about stupid IT-department.

I don't know why but somehow,  Firefox which I use for years ; (Thx by the way) ; corrupted my data on the run...? I started Firefox again but, no extension, no bookmarks, etc.. I Have kept a backup of all this FF profile, just in case. </p><p>My 1st step was to try to get a new profile a import my previous data from Firefox Sync - but somehow , I'm angry at myself again for not understanding how FF Sync work, no data from FFSync  updated my data - It stayed like this for a long time , like a new profile without data (I used Xmarks before so I thought it was replacing it). </p><p>2nd step: I tried to load all bookmarks-xxx.jsonlz4 located in the bookmarkbackups folder from the FF bookmarks tools (Import / export ; etc). FF seems to see all the bookmarks but can't load them. What is really important here is that FF backed up files for like a month and even my oldest file is unusable  : bookmarks-2019-01-19-xxx.jsonlz4 !! </p><p>3rd step: I tried to get my data back from FF files, in bookmarks files like bookmarks-2019-01-19-xxx.jsonlz4 from the bookmarkbackups folder. Someone pointed me to use the <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/bookbackreader.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/bookbackreader.html</a> website but all the jsonlz4 files in the bookmarkbackups folder seems corrupted (or the format of files changed and his tool may need to be updated ?) </p><p>Example :  File name: bookmarks-2019-01-19_2392_mKZssqkWMZt+Mqt-HOi68A==.jsonlz4; Size: 283114; last modified 18/01/2019 à 12:38:42 (failed JSON parsing: SyntaxError: Unexpected token in JSON at position 21928) Note: To try a different file, reload this page Can't seem to acces the step 2 part even after waiting longer </p><p>4th step: tried to get old Backup of my FF Profiles with Windows 10 Shadow Copy System, ""Shadow Explorer"" or ""System Restore Explorer"" Found 3 backup wich I restored also, all bookmarks seems to get the same problem. I think I'll need to look in to this because It's not official Windows tools, but I'm really disapointed here.. I think I'll put them on md5sum tools to compare them for a start. </p><p>5th  step : tried to repair my &lt;places.sqlite&gt; a (80MB files) which I found renamed to sqlite.corrupt.

I've had a few minor issues with Firefox in the past, but this is by far the most bizarre, and as of yet the only one that's completely broken it. The best way I could describe it is... the tabs bar, where all the open tabs in any given window are located, is usually located ABOVE the search bar, right? Well, the search bar decided to rebel and go to the very top of any windows I have open, effectively merging with the tabs bar, completely breaking the UI and rendering the browser more or less useless. I can almost fix it by just clicking &amp; holding on any open tabs and fidgeting around a bit, but it goes straight back to its usual broken state as soon as I click back into the tab.  </p><p>FWIW, this only happened once my PC restarted to automatically update Windows at like 2:30 AM or whatever time I set it to, so as far as I can tell I had no direct hand in causing this. Also, as you could probably gather by my previous sentence, I'm using Windows 10, if that matters. Feel free to inquire about anything else, since while I don't mind using Chrome for a bit, I would like this problem to be fixed ASAP since I do prefer Firefox. I've searched around a bit and haven't found anyone else with this exact same issue, so I don't know if it was caused by a Firefox update or what. Also, I would just LOVE to include some screenshots to better explain the problem, but frankly this stupid little upload image button is being real useless right now. The screenshot thing within Firefox apparently doesn't allow you to capture the search bar or open tabs, and when I try to upload a screenshot using a different program, it just endlessly says ""uploading image."" It's just a friggin' .png file, why are you having so much trouble uploading it?! Oh well, I guess today just isn't my day.

Even the network analysis tool of firefox tells me, that it uses only one IP-address for the different subdomains, but the DNS-lookup tool of about:network resolves different IP’s. Other browsers like Chrome or Edge still work fine since the change.

And I was expecting that by now, after all this time, there should be a quick easy patch to just click apply and be rid of that nuisance once and for all... Is one EVER going to come out ??  </p><p>CCleaner is a wonderful product, including the free version, and it's such a shame to have to disable Firefox from being monitored.  That's where half or more of my cleaning duties come from. And I just don't know if Firefox's internal alternative does as thorough a scrubbing...   </p><p>If you know of a patch about this subject, please do post.... I can't find one anywhere.

The flickering only seems to appear when on reddit (lesser so twitter and even less on youtube) while scrolling/using videos. When I hover over the video to preview future scenes it REALLY flickers fast and hard. This issue occurs nearly instantly or within one minute and then continues. The only solution I've found is to disable hardware acceleration. This flickering DOES NOT occur on chrome for the limited time I've been using it (1 hour and maybe more now unfortunately)and does not require hardware acceleration to be disabled. This issues also DOES NOT occur while on my old dell monitor or my very old tv. Any ideas or help? Chrome is so much slower and worse than firefox and I do not want to have to use both browsers nor return this new monitor!

The buyer doesn’t pay anything extra.  </p><p>PROBLEM with Firefox/Google Chrome  </p><p>Many charities have applied (because they can get free donations through their users who are already shopping online), recently we have implemented in our system a function where each project can make their own subdomain.  </p><p>This means, if you have a charity called ABC, you can create ABC.xxxxxxxx.xx and automatically you have selected the ABC charity. Very handy for charities, because it’s easy promotion.  </p><p>Now here’s the problem, we have bought a SSL wildcard certificate to establish https:// connection for all these subdomains.  </p><p>BUT, some are typing into their URL boxes: www.abc.xxxxxxxx.xx and this CANNOT be certified. Technically it can if we manually insert every subdomain into multiple certificates, which would cost us thousands of dollars. Also our subdomains are not set, new ones are being created all the time.  </p><p>Both Firefox and Google Chrome now always give an error message when people type in their URL address with ‘www.’. People cannot even reach the website, it gives un <em>unsafe warning</em> and shoppers won’t donate for free to their charity.  </p><p>We have redirected the ‘www.’ to ‘without www.’ but this doesn’t help.  </p><p>PLEASE HELP  </p><p>Is there any way where you could help, for example by listing these sub-subdomains as safe? I can give you any kind of openness to prove there is nothing scammy going on.  </p><p>I’m willing to change these domain setups towards xxxxxxxx.xx/abc instead of abc.xxxxxxxx.xx but it takes a while.

I always end up having many tabs open in several windows and today I clued into how much time I waste trying to find the right window. I currently have 128 tabs open over 5 windows and every time I shut down and start up Firefox I ""restore previous session"". I started looking today for a way to label my windows so that I can have them as categories like ""Music"", ""School"", ""Health"", ""General Learning"", etc.  I use a Macbook and use the 4 finger swipe down or up all the time and wanted to see my windows labeled to clearly see the types of tabs I have open regardless of what tab was up front. There are a few plug ins that do that but I don't like the permissions that they need like ""Access your data for all websites"". it seemed excessive for just a label. </p><p>Then I thought. well it's basically a visual bookmark system. but I don't use bookmarks because everything disappears once I put it in bookmarks - it becomes less relevant when it's next to things from 8 years ago. here's what I imagine: </p><p>Primary idea: </p><p>- windows and bookmark folders are virtually the same thing, and tabs and bookmarks are virtually the same thing. </p><p>- I can command-click or option-click on one of the bookmarks in a folder and it opens in a window that is labeled as the bookmark folder name </p><p>--- I can command-click-drag to open several bookmarks as tabs in a window that is labeled as the bookmark folder name </p><p>--- new bookmarks I open from that folder open as tabs in the window of the same name if it's already open </p><p><br> Secondary thoughts for better flow: </p><p>- button in top corner of window will open a list of all the tabs open in that window but the list will be wide enough that you can actually read what the tab is instead of just the first 5 letters.  </p><p>--- this way I can easily reorganize my open tabs. </p><p>--- below list of open tabs in that window is a list of the other bookmarks in that folder that aren't opened that I can click on to open or drag up into the the ""open"" list and drop it where I want that tab to open up. </p><p>--- if you want to get real fancy I can drag the tab from the list back up to the top corner and the other open window lists open up so I can move it to a different window - alternatively I can right click on it and select ""move to"" or ""copy to"" and choose a window or bookmark folder. </p><p>- colouring or aging can show how recently each tab or bookmark was opened - This link shows what I mean <a href=""https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210012/card-aging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210012/card-aging</a> </p><p>- Turn on an option that when I hover over the title it shows a small render of the site (in bookmark menu or tab list) </p><p><br> Troubles to think about: </p><p>- Discerning between short term bookmarks (stored tabs) and long term bookmarks (regular bookmarks) - perhaps add a ""lock"" to the bookmarks you want to keep. </p><p>--- some bookmarks i want permanently saved until I delete the bookmark (how it works now) </p><p>--- some I want to be more transient so that when I close the tab it means I'm done with it (how I treat tabs now) </p><p>--- when implementing the ""move to"" or ""copy to"" suggestion above, you may want that move or copy to be a permanent or transient bookmark. I suggest keeping the ""bookmark"" word to mean permanent so perhaps a ""bookmark to"" option. </p><p>--- Perhaps closing a window doesn't remove them from the bookmarks folder, but closing the tabs individually does unless it's ""locked"" </p><p>All of this will help me to keep my tabs to a minimum when I start firefox and when I want to pick up on a different subject I can easily open all of the relevant tabs - most of which aren't ""bookmark"" worthy at this point, they're just there till I deal with them and close them.

The ""default"" size always runs off the edge of the screen, which means they aren't functional as-is (whatever's off the screen obviously can't be read or otherwise interacted with).  It also tends to consistently move windows to the left, so they're stacked right on top of each other (messily) instead of being spaced out. </p><p>I can and do resize it, but it's a complete pain to do so every single time... especially since I use cascading windows to let me navigate between windows easily, so the oversize and overlap means I can't easily access several windows until I do resize and move each one.  Since my task bar/desktop is unreliable, I can't use the icons or shortcuts pull up windows unless I can actually click on them on the screen - this problem is outside the scope of the question, of course, it just explains why I cannot find a workaround. </p><p>Since firefox usually restarts when updating or other automated restarts, which triggers the windows to change size on restarting, I tried manually resizing the windows and then manually shutting down and reopening firefox to see if that would ""save"" the new sizes - this was a catastrophic failure, it failed to save or open *any* of my windows, showing no recently closed windows or tabs in history and no previous browsing sessions.  And I do have it set up to open previous windows and sessions, I went through and double checked *every* setting after that.  I did have session sync going, so I could save some of it - but only some, since session sync fails to save the history of any tab (to show previous pages) and I often stack several related pages in one tab to organize.

As I understand things, Firefox writes a bunch of files to the user's home dir on the first time startup.  Maybe the fact that the home dirs are NFS mounts might explain the delay.

The UI is responsive, except the hamburger menu and any other extension buttons which bring up popup menus; they are all clickable but don't do anything. Sometimes it will freeze my page too (or, more specifically, an image of my page, while the actual page is working on the background, confirmed this on YouTube, by playing a video, and the page froze but I was still hearing sound). </p><p>At start this would be fixed with a simple restart of the browser, but as the problem showed up more often with the passage of time, this was not a solution.

Well for all those people who enjoy a Chrome clone 'bully for you', I hate it, and it can not be solved by normal settings. The fact that the solution lies somewhere in a Chrome coding excercise means that Firefox is now being buit on the Chrome framework, so somewhere in there probably lurks the chrome [read google] 'information dragnet'. That's shut the door as far as I am concerned. I found that Pale Moon still offers 'tabs on bottom'. [so atop the web page] Even Vivaldi, which I am sure is also a chrome clone offers a real Tabs at the bottom, so actually at the bottom of the web page. No after years of use I am kicking Firefox into touch [so expunging]. Now I have to wonder how long it's going to take before I am forced to discard Thunderbird!

My concern is whenever I updated the browser from the past, It deletes my settings and extensions. That's whats keeping me from updating it for quite sometime now. So Im simply afraid to do it. For example. Part of my research entails an extension that downloads and converts from a video site. After an update this is removed. I have to re-install everytime. I so got tired of this. Its so annoying everytime it asks for updating, I have to opt out.  Is there some way I can update this without messing up my settings?  Has Mozilla already worked out a version without messing with my settings?

I have a link to an .m4v video file that I need to download (I don't ever want links directly to m4v, mp4, mov, etc playing in the browser, I need to download these files to my computer).  Whenever I click the link, it automatically opens up a blank page and starts playing the video.  Nothing I do will give me the 'Ask what to do' prompt.  How can I fix this? Things I've tried: Changing the default action to 'Mpeg-4 movie' under Options/Applications to 'Always Ask'.  Even if the link is an mp4, it still plays it in the browser. Manually added an entry for .m4v by editing handlers.json, and setting it to 'Always ask'.  Still plays in the browser. Set both Mpeg-4 Movie and the manual m4v entry to 'Save File'.  Still plays in the browser. Tried doing a 'Save As' while it was playing to just save my file, but Firefox then tries to save the file as 'FileName.m4v.mp4' instead of just 'FileName.m4v'.  I'm not sure if it's actually re-wrapping the file into another container, or just arbitrarily adding an extra extension to the filename, but I need it to, by default, save as the file name that is used on the server... (If it's just renaming the file, I can live with this one bug if I can make the rest of the functionality work.) </p><p>Can anyone offer any tips on this? Can anyone explain an easier way to manually add an extension into the Application section? </p><p>Here's a test page: <a href=""http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody/test.html</a> Underneath the thumbnail image/embedded video there direct links to an mp4, ogg video and WebM video. The action I want, when I click on any one of those, is for Firefox to prompt me with a download location to save the file to (the usual 'Always Ask' dialog box).  NOTHING should attempt to play in the web browser itself. I've been able to do this with every version of Firefox 'pre-Quantum', but I just can't make the latest version do it... </p><p>(Another work-around that may seem obvious is to right-click the file name and click 'Save Link As'.  While this works on the sample page, it doesn't work on the pages I have to download these videos from...  It's a scripted button that sends back the link to the file when clicked on.) </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-650;,firefox,customize,en-US,1196263;1196403;1196538;1196540;1196541;1196544;1196549;1196555;1196710;1196831;1196832;1196835;,rik1138

In the end the use of these pages is similar to the use of software in its own right. Daily, I need to return often to pages but they are drowning in the tabs. And it would be useful to be able to find them and access them more easily. </p><p>The goal of the suggestion is to be able to improve the behavior of Mozilla Firefox tabs by allowing to manage them in an independent window as if it were a third party software. The window could drag and drop into the taskbar, as if it were a different application of Firefox, with as icon, either the icon of the open site or a mix of the icon of the open site and Mozilla Firefox icon to quickly differentiate these Mozilla Firefox windows from other software. </p><p>This will allow users to open a frequently used work page in a tab, detach it from other tabs, and drag and drop it into the taskbar. As long as the browser is not closed, this page is accessible normally and quickly (in 1 click) from the taskbar. This would provide a more pleasant and fluid UX. Especially as SaaS become more and more numerous and the performance of browsers and scripts allow it. </p><p>And why not consider being able to attach its windows to the taskbar to allow to re-open these windows easily. </p><p>Thank you to read me so far and i apologize for the English mistakes. I would be happy to know your opinion on this proposal </p><p>Have nice to day to everyone :-) </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1196121;1196615;,RemiFongaufier

So Mozilla Firefox must be blocking file references from local hard Drive root level. If there is a config variable or two I can set to allow it from firefox, I'd appreciate knowing about it.

Earlier, I had read that the SuperantiSpyware.exe software get recommended and I liked it. But unfortunately, it started to start running , but when I checked the properities, the owner was no longer Superanitspyware but a company called <a href=""http://Support.com?"" rel=""nofollow"">Support.com?</a> This was after I had changed the file and folder permissions to allow System access to the software file and folder I had installed SuperantiSpyware to. Now it looks like the Superantispyware software is running (and its Ui Dashboard Console), but when I check with TaskManager and look at it's properities , I see it was sponsored by someone else (I mean the software itself as seen in the properties submenu of Taskmanager for the .exe file - it doesn't mention SuperantiSpware.exe ; the digital signatures page for the software now says <a href=""http://Support.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Support.com</a> instead of the name of SuperantiSpyware company!!). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-650;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1195576;,Samk1977

Left-clicking always works properly. However, the ""save link as"" function in Firefox Quantum won't work at all - the ""save as"" dialog box comes up with ""checkme.php"" as the suggested filename (which is wrong!), but then saves nothing ... in fact, when some dummy text is written into ""checkme.php"", no output is produced - it's as though ""checkme.php"" isn't even being accessed. Any clues? (Sorry - troublehooting info says ""We're sorry, but we can't find what you're looking for."". OS=Windows 7, browser=Firefox Qantum V65.0).

I played around with it, even copying the Profile directory from another computer, removing/reinstalling both FF and Flash, did not work.  Game works fine with MS Internet Explorer.

I had Firefox up and working for years, though I had been using it rarely in the past couple of years. Still, I even had it ""divided"" between home and a couple of business versions (however that should be referred to). Then, tiring of Chrome (and hating Safari), I though I'd try Firefox again. When I cranked it up, I got a note that said I should update Firefox. So, like a reasonable user, I hit the go button, as it were. Smart move? My reply to that would involve many phrases and words not to be used in polite company. MY Firefox disappeared. Gone. Everything. Settings, bookmarks, ""users."" It was as if I had never, ever installed Firefox before. Virgin Firefox, one might say. Pure, unsullied, unused. So where the hell is MY Firefox? If I can get it back, I'll be delighted. If it indeed, as seems to be the case from my viewpoint at the moment, it is gone forever, then, well, sadly, I will be an ex-Firefox user forever. I can't see any reason for me to try to rebuild it all. Chrome may be annoying, but it does work and work well. </p><p>I'm using a Mac Mini.

Or might as I suspect, I can use an older version of FF, one that's compatible with Outlook 2007 and one that Yahoo aka 'Google-hoo' will 'leave me/us be'? </p><p>Ultimately I'm wanting to keep what works (my money too), despite the flaunted less secure-ness of W7 and Outlook 2007, because I believe I'm savvy enough to likely avoid the touted pitfalls by avoiding online banking, not e-mailing company's I've not researched beforehand, maintaining reliable and respected AV, etc., etc.). </p><p>So I'm hopeful can find a FF version that'll support Outlook 2007's e-mail application and  hopefully (only later use will likely tell) browser which still supports Yahoo mail.  Or am I simply being blocked by the expected deals being made designed to force users into buying into Windows 10? </p><p>Accordingly I suspect if I go with FF's v65, likely I might any longer be able to use my Outlook 2003's email handler, and only be able to send and receive via or through FF's email application, thus likely not the convenience of being able to use my email storage application (Fogware e-mail backup and relocator) to export each year's sent, rec'd emails. </p><p>So likely as not, I'll be forced to use other means of saving them as mentioned, possibly via FF's browser.  But heck, I found it nearly impossible just to unhide what the current version f FF's browser is (v65), let alone what 'Google-hoo's up to. </p><p>Long of the short of it is, might someone in the know be able to tell me anything towards what we're dealing with here and how best to go about assuring I can still get my <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> addressed e-mails if not only through FF's browser, then hopefully also thru Outlook 2007? </p><p>From what I can find and confirm, might FF's v65 browser actually cross link with my Outlook 2003's handler, or if not then surely with Outlook's 2007's e-mail application by simply acquiring a full version of Office '12'? </p><p>Best regards and otherwise 'happ-e-trails to all', </p><p>wguru </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1193052;,wguru
