1276220,2019-12-31 15:39:50 -0800,2019-12-31T15:39:50Z,How to reduce multiple prompts for master password when accessing saved logins (Lockwise)?,"<p>When viewing saved logins, earlier versions of Firefox would prompt once for the master password before showing the saved login passwords. This assumes the master password had been entered correctly when prompted sometime after starting the browser. </p><p>With the Quantum/Lockwise changes, there are multiple, repeating prompts for the master password during the process of accessing the saved login data. Is this a bug, or is there a way to reduce the repeated requests? Because the master password is so important, mine is long and complex. Having to type it in multiple times in the space of a minute or two seems unnecessary and annoying. </p><p>When accessing Saved Logins, it asks for the Master Password. That's OK and consistent with prior Firefox behavior. But then when I find a login and want to look at it it asks the Master Password again. If I then want to copy it, it asks again. If I look at several different logins, each login, and each action on each login, requires entering the master password over and over. That is a bit much, IHMO.  </p><p>Once the user has reached the Saved Logins (Lockwise), they should be considered authenticated for the duration working with Lockwise. Further password prompts should not be needed. If Lockwise is closed, then it would be appropriate to re-authenticate.  The page could time-out and auto-close if left unattended for an extended period of time.  </p><p>Are there any settings to reduce the usability challenges of the current behavior? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tim.11.g,""

1276197,2019-12-31 08:38:00 -0800,2019-12-31T08:38:00Z,Firefox stops downloading resources after heavy use,"<p>When I use firefox very heavily (100-200 tabs open) then after few weeks or sometimes about month of use it stops downloading some resources. Sometimes its videos that no longer play. This time it was images. This time it started with spotify logging me out automatically after I logged in. It did not lag, it was not slow it was running smoothly. It just started to log me out like in 10 sec after login. I switched to Edge and it didnt log me out there. The bug was also in private browsing. Few minutes later I discovered that Aliexpress stopped showing me new images - it would load me images that I had already visited but for new images it would just show me empty box and image alt text. This also broke in both normal mode and private browsing mode. In Edge this also worked so I understood it was firefox problem, not my network problem.  </p><p>To solve the issue I tried to clear recent history for time range everything and checked cache and offline website data. It did not help. Then I also tried to use forget about this site from history and Ctrl + F5 to make it force reload data. It did not help either. I also tried garbage collection and cycle collection because I thought that something was wrong in the memory. </p><p>After these operations I tried to manually visit image location which I grabbed using inspect element. It turned out that firefox indeed downloaded the image but it turned out it did not completely download it. It downloaded 8.22kb data instead of 12kb and image viewers were not able to open it while visiting the same url with Edge gave me correct image which means that it wasnt faulty resource on server side. </p><p>When it previously happened to me videos stopped to play both in private and normal browsing. It also does not seem to be dependent on FF version. This time it happened with FF 70.0. It was not running out of disk space - had still over hundred GB left nor RAM (it only used 25G out of 64G). I use Windows 10 x64. </p><p>I know I could have solved this issue with browser restart (which I did by now) but but since I usually have a lot of stuff going on and just restoring tabs isn't enough for me because reloading tab from internet does not restore it exactly as it was before since all the JS progress will be lost but sometimes some tabs I need exactly as they were which is why I would not like to restart firefox very often. </p><p>I would like to know what causes such issues and if there is any other way than browser restart to fix it? Like manually deleting something from somewhere? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Win32FFUser,""

I could not find any information on opening that ""last session"", so resorted to uncompressing and editing the sessionstore file.  I removed the initial section for the new session, and removed the ""lastSessionState"" key.  The remainder of the file seemed to have the same structure as the initial session section.  Not having an easy way to re-compress the file, I copied it into the profile as sessionstore.js, as, once upon a time, folks said that sessionstore.js would be read if sessionstore.jsonlz4 was not present.  I hid all the files in sessionstore-backups.  However, when I started Firefox, it did not find the old session.  So... </p><p>Hoping someone knows:  Is there a way to get Firefox to switch to the ""lastSessionState"" session?  Or, do I need to compress the fixed up sessionstore.js in order to get Firefox to recognize it?  Thanks! </p><p>(Thanks to the author of the decompression tool dejsonlz4, <a href=""https://github.com/avih/dejsonlz4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/avih/dejsonlz4</a> !

There was an extraneous character on the end of the file, probably a leftover ""}"".  When I opened the file in Firefox, it did not object, but I renamed it to sessionstore.json, and then it did say there were characters past the legal JSON.  And it kindly told me what character the error occurred at, which was one less than the file size.  (Notepad++ was able to read and operate on the file, but could not render the end of the 9MB long single line -- characters were overlapped -- so it was hard to see what was on the end.  And it was hard to tell where the cursor was.  I'm fairly sure that I used vim before, and that the session was smaller.  Not wanting to take further chances, I used cut to take off the last character.  I don't have Cygwin or WSL re-installed yet, but Git Bash had cut available.) </p><p>So, I replaced the contents of a new profile with the damaged profile, took out all the session files, and put in the repaired sessionstore.js...and it recognized it and opened it.

I just need to get anything important out of the temporary instance (like this page) and open those tabs in the real one. </p><p>The remaining question is...

Watch and wish for it, but don't hold your breath...  I am the front lines of this war Good vrs Evil, is why the demons have tried 47-times to murder me, and counting..  I see them coming far in advance, and I toy with them..  It's become a strange hobby..  lol, the second last attempted hitter, I exposed only too well.. Two months later his handlers disposed of him and his family to keep their secret crimes with him secret and forever silent.. It's a game to me.. I don't fear death, I've visited death ten-times..  Death is a fun game to me..  My spirit has already ascended beyond all your heaven and hell silliness...    If I can establish Mr.Trump as Emperor Titanium Trump of the league of nations, only then will Good win the great war against Evil on this dying planet...  'Ole Titanium nuts' could fix it under my guidance... The real problem forcing me to request assistance here from you artisan-class group of computer experts, is that government agencies are trying to steal new data from everywhere, forever trying to drill and punch holes in Firefox..  They are the reason you have to work so hard on browser security..  They believe it's their job and right to steal..  It's all about Ultimate Greed, dead-spirits, and cancerous insanity...  Mozilla's Firefox is our only front-line defense, but, it seems that Firefox's new defenses somehow need be maintained secret deep inside the software, because the world is just too crazy, too global asylum, too sick.. There needs be places and spots in Firefox Browser that expert hackers can't even begin to open, can't penetrate, can't influence, can't corrupt, can't see the coding, like a sealed administration-vault that can't be opened by anyone outside of Mozilla's labs..  It's come to that... </p> id:1277454,created:2019-12-31 10:07:58 -0800,updated:2019-12-31 10:07:58 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Did you try the TextArea Cache extension that I mentioned? </p> id:1277388,created:2019-12-31 00:00:40 -0800,updated:2019-12-31 00:00:40 -0800,creator:heavenschoice,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Wesley.. </p><p>I just surfed your name on Google.. </p><p>Do you like to build new computer stuff..?

I have researched it &amp; found nothing specific (details) on exactly what Mozilla is doing. I don't ask specific questions unless I've researched a topic enough to know when I'm at the stage of reinventing the wheel.  </p><p>I'm assuming a lot here. I'm asking what data is Mozilla gathering, to create (I assume) a token for the user.  </p><p>Is Mozilla acting as the authorization provider, or using other, say like, Google?  Why?

Just a ""<em><strong>simple</strong></em>"" authentication process, like OAuth, allows users to leverage the data from popular social networking services.</blockquote> <p>To non-technical users, that doesn't mean much.  They often don't read privacy policies or TOS - for anything. But, one of the things the above statement means is, facebook &amp; twitter are tracking users, even more than in the past.  It also likely means they are building a device fingerprint or improving one they already have.  But it doesn't stop w/ just 2 sites. </p><p>For instance,  I'm using this intro to oAuth article, [<a href=""https://itnext.io/an-oauth-2-0-introduction-for-beginners-6e386b19f7a9?gi=18693800aa46"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itnext.io/an-oauth-2-0-introduction-for-beginn...</a>] if other users want a better understanding of what oAuth is &amp; exactly how it does what it does (in the hands of <strong>oAuth providers</strong> or the sites offering ""services"").  </p> <blockquote> there are four different versions. Or, more correctly, four different flows. OAuth 2 is the totality of these flows. It’s not mandatory to implement them all, but only the ones that you need.  The goal remains <strong>always the same</strong>: to obtain an access_token and use it to access protected resources. The four modalities are: <ul><li> Authorization Code Grant: </li><li> Implicit Grant: </li><li> Client Credential Grant: </li><li> Password Grant:  </li></ul> </blockquote> <p>Which of those is Mozilla using (or none of above)? </p><p>The <a href=""http://itnext.io"" rel=""nofollow"">itnext.io</a> article has some detailed illustrations of various possibilities &amp; the idealized process (which can vary greatly).  Much depends on what a site wants to know about the user. </p><p>[<a href=""https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.github.com/apps/bui.../understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/</a>] The term ""<strong>Scopes""</strong> refers to what data a particular oAuth provider's oAuth API offers &amp; what the site (or on Github, the project developer) wants out of everything that is accessible. </p><p>On Github's explanation of ""oAuth Scopes"" for Github project developers, a few (out of many) thing it lists are: </p> <blockquote> <strong>read:user</strong> 	Grants access to read a user's profile data. <strong>user:email</strong> 	Grants read access to a <em><strong>user's email addresses.</strong></em> <strong>user:follow</strong> 	Grants access to follow or unfollow other users.</blockquote> <p>Maybe not as much for typical Github users, but they're offering to project developers - setting up an oAuth app, to read the email address(es) users' account profiles (I assume).  Project devs on Github don't need to read my email addresses or anything else.  Unless they're a well known, going concern, they have essentially zero credibility.  I agreed to terms with Github, Inc. to create an acct - not w/ dozens of 1 man projects I might visit. </p><p>Here's Google's basic details on THEIR oAuth API, that sites can use.  I wonder if Google would be interested in the users' data, gathered in the oAuth authorization process? [<a href=""https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/identit.../OAuth2</a>] </p><p>Google says,  </p> <blockquote>The Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint supports applications that are installed on devices such as computers, mobile devices, and tablets.</blockquote>  <p>Going a bit farther:  <a href=""https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp</a> </p> <blockquote>OAuth 2.0 <strong>allows users to share specific data</strong> with an application <strong>while keeping their usernames, passwords, and other information private.</strong> For example, an application can use OAuth 2.0 to obtain permission from users to store files in their Google Drives.  Installed apps are distributed to individual devices, and it is assumed that these apps cannot keep secrets. They can access Google APIs while the user is present at the app or when the app is running in the background.</blockquote> <p>Who could ever envision something going wrong or being abused, when large corporations are the oAuth providers; many of which are known for their (sometimes illegal) data gathering on users? </p><p>There are certain scenarios where this would be useful, IF USERS really want to SHARE THEIR DATA between 2 or more sites (or sites' services).  If they distrust Site A so much, that they don't want to create &amp; use a user name /password on it.   </p><p>The oAuth provider (even if a site / corp. is its own provider), is saying, trust us with your PW &amp; potentially a whole lot of other data about your device, and we'll vouch to Site A that you are who you say you are.  It appears to be fingerprinting devices.  While that's OK for my bank or I'll give them my phone for 2FA - 2 factor authentication, but I won't give it to sites unless they are a well known site, that are protecting my assets. </p><p>For many avg users, if a quilting or learn bird calling site uses oAuth, users may well be giving up more data than they realize or would want, if they understood the process; most will not understand the process.  </p><p>Here's a Wikipedia partial list of ""<em>List of notable OAuth service providers</em>.""  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OAuth_providers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OAuth_providers</a> </p><p>Note that many are known large user-data gatherers. </p><p>I guess the original question was exactly what / how is Mozilla using oAuth to identify users (if Mozilla is the provider)? What data will they ask (I assume they'll ask) users to approve access to, just to login a support forum?

We transform your passphrase on your computer into two different, unrelated values. With one value, you cannot derive the other. We send an authentication token, derived from your passphrase, to the server as the password-equivalent. And the encryption key derived from your passphrase never leaves your computer. ...... Interested in the technical details? We use 1000 rounds of PBKDF2 to derive your passphrase into the authentication token. On the server, we additionally hash this token with scrypt (parameters N=65536, r=8, p=1) to make sure our database of authentication tokens is even more difficult to crack. </p><p>We derive your passphrase into an encryption key using the same 1000 rounds of PBKDF2. It is domain-separated from your authentication token by using HKDF with separate info values. We use this key to unwrap an encryption key (which you generated during setup and which we never see unwrapped), and that encryption key is used to protect your data. We use the key to encrypt your data using AES-256 in CBC mode, protected with an HMAC."" </p> id:1277348,created:2019-12-30 18:07:54 -0800,updated:2019-12-30 19:22:35 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:cor-el,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>See also: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/access-mozilla-services-firefox-account"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/access-mozilla-services-firefox-account</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/share-data-mozilla-help-improve-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/share-data-mozilla-help-improve-firefox</a> </li></ul> <hr> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/</a> </li><li><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/</a> </li></ul> id:1277342,created:2019-12-30 17:52:24 -0800,updated:2019-12-30 17:52:24 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>Joebt <a href=""#question-1276161"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> On the ""more info"" page for Firefox accounts, it says, <blockquote>""The Firefox browser collects so little data about you, we don’t even require your email address.

Now the site uses your Firefox Account for login, so there would normally be no difference between the Firefox Account you use for Sync or other services, and for this site. I mean, you <em>could</em> create a new Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo/etc. email address and use that to create a separate Firefox account for support if you wanted. </p> <blockquote> Exactly what method are they using to register users or recognize them in different sessions?

That is the variable that has bitten me in the a$$ a few times over the years when I have used Sync to 'populate' a new PC; weeks lost to trying to fix what was missed by Sync. I finally resorted to just copying over the Profile from the ""soon to be retired PC"" after finding out what Sync missed and wasting too much time in an effort to prevent that ""loss"" from occurring the next time. <em>I don't mind learning from my mistakes, but Sync is constantly being changed so a new PC every 3 to 4 years doesn't present a good learning environment.</em> </p> id:1277217,created:2019-12-30 09:46:24 -0800,updated:2019-12-30 09:46:24 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>In many cases, you <em>can</em> use Firefox Sync to do that.

Now, if I restart FF, it will resume the tabs, also opening the URL that caused it to hang.","<p>I clicked on a site that behaves like a rogue and locks me out of any further clicks in FF (including the X-Close in the taskbar).  I had to shut FF down by stopping the process in Task Manager.  Since I have the FF option set to resume the previous session, restarting just puts the last tab I opened in control, so I'm still locked out.  How can I restart FF at this point without its opening the rogue tab? I read that if you aborted FF twice in a row, the 3rd time it would restart and present the Oh oh! Restore Tabs screen, where you could eliminate any problem tabs.  But I've tried that several times (killing it with TaskMan), and I never get the Restore Tabs.

More info:  <ul><li> <a href=""/en-US/kb/dedicated-profiles-firefox-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">Dedicated profiles per Firefox installation</a>  </li></ul>  Also, two different Windows accounts should not share the same profiles, so that's strange. </blockquote> <p>Hey thanks for your help, I am slightly 'technically impaired' but understand some things. </p><p>From what I read from the links you provide, and any links within those articles, are you saying I should launch Firefox through the command line with the --allow-downgrade parameter?  </p><p>When I try the route of changing the default profile, I get the same error message and am not able to use the old profile that came from the previous version of Firefox. </p><p>I also see the sync option.

Pinned tabs are so unstable that they are basically useless. Currently pinned tabs are unpinning themselves when I load and work in forms on the corresponding pages. I'm not accidentally unpinning them. It's happening spontaneously for no apparent reason. It isn't related to any tab extensions. I am certain of this because I have disabled all of them and it still keeps happening. Click tab, work on page, click other tab to do form work on other tab, go back to previous tab and it's not there because it's unpinned. It's gotten maddening to be perfectly honest as there doesn't appear to be any solution to the problem and I've honestly reached the point after this feature being so unstable for so long that I don't understand why the feature even exists since it's never worked reliably sine it's inception. What's going on with this? I used to be able to use tab locking addons that worked far better than this but now no one is able to make them due to the changes.

The reason I can say this is because it has been, as stated above, going on since the switch to the new addon system (pinned tabs has never been stable for me at all, on more than one system).

I am concerned with saved passwords since many have changed since I have been on Chrome.   </p><p>I could create  a new profile and import there.  </p><p>Anyway, I would appreciate any suggestions here on the best way to handle the migration.

I have been syncing with with FF and  Chrome for several years across computers.  My question is more about how syncing will work with multiple profiles.  For example, if I migrate my Chrome bookmarks over to FF in a 2nd profile, say Profile B and I have bookmarks  (hundreds) in Profile A, many of which are the same those in Profile B, how the syncing work.  Will it sync the bookmarks in Profile A, Profile B with FF on the other computers.  And what if there are multiple profiles on multiple machines.   </p><p>Also, I was not suggesting to copy the prefs.js file across computers, but accross profiles.

Then, if you add Bookmark C, it will go to both computers regardless of what computer you add it on. </p><p>If you are looking to keep the bookmarks on one computer or a group of computers separate from the bookmarks on another computer or another group of computers, you would need to use two different Firefox Sync accounts or not use Firefox Sync at all on certain devices. </p><p>Hopefully that clarifies your question. </p><p>And, as cor-el said above, it's really not recommended to manually copy the <code>prefs.js</code> file because it contains a lot of internal settings and IDs that may not be correct if you copy it over. </p> id:1277269,created:2019-12-30 13:39:13 -0800,updated:2019-12-30 13:39:13 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Note that it isn't recommended to copy prefs.js because this file contains a lot of profile and computer setup specific data. </p><p>Note that the user.js file is read each time Firefox is started and initializes preferences to the value specified in this file, so preferences set via user.js can only be changed temporarily for the current session. </p> id:1277239,created:2019-12-30 11:03:02 -0800,updated:2019-12-30 11:03:02 -0800,creator:dmcmillen,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks Wesley.

However onto the problem.  I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser.  My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ).  The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load.  In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space. </p><p>I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked.  I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter.  So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe.  However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on.  When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine. </p><p>Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head.  I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default.  I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem.  Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem. </p><p>Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet.  Here's hoping I catch some good advice.  :3 </p><p>If you've read this far, thanks.

This problem has been resolved, and I can't believe it.  I'm ashamed of having put off seeking help with this problem earlier.  In either case, the problem is no more!  I can't tell you which solution worked, because since they were both working in the same location and the *.js file was an aberration.  I didn't bother even looking into it beyond having looked into who created it. </p><p>So, that toxic bloatware nuisance I'd thought I had eliminated the tendrils it had in my computer managed to screw with my computer at least one last time.  <strong>Advanced SystemCare</strong> was recently installed used for about a day and then promptly uninstalled.  It was also the creator of the *.js file, and to date has caused more problems with my computers software than any viral or malware has to date.  Wretched program that is, and a pain to get rid of.  It doesn't surprise me that it was the culprit. </p><p>Again... I can't thank both of you enough for your extremely fast response.  Let alone to solutions that when combined managed to also point out what the likely real cause of this problem might have been.  Anyway, all better now. </p><p>I am most grateful, and hope that you both have a wonderful evening and a safe start to the new year.  Be well, and best wishes for 2021. </p><p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Uhm.  To remove this, I have to flag an answer as being the solution.

The best option so far, is to have a shortcut to my desktop to access the parent of Cache2 folder and sending the whole folder to the recycle bin in one piece. BUT it would be a nicer option if a Firefox programmer can give us the option to delete every entry in this folder upon exit, with 1GB of Internet speed this folder is not needed for mercy sake. P.S. <strong>""browser.cache.disk.capacity"" </strong> will always reset to 1044480 no matter what you do. So it is a totally useless option. </p>"

This isn't a perfect solution if there are times you want to load an MP3 or video into its own tab for viewing in Firefox, but it is easy to turn off and on when neeeded.

And my Ad-On account carried over to the new one and I didn't update the email on that account it was using the same email that my old sumo account is.

The method I would probably recommend for your situation is to create a dummy copy of your extension with the same ID. Make sure it's a blank extension that doesn't do anything.

You set up a development version of your add-on so that Firefox treats it as a fresh install each time, so you can test how it behaves on a fresh machine.

But I have several others that the browser doesn't give me the option to identify. My browser froze up today and took 15 minutes before it started working again. It wouldn't even let me use the Task Manager to clear the current tasks... Then after it unfroze it was so slow I had to reboot.

Although it's not happening quiet as often as it was before I followed all your suggestions, I still have the aggravating Firefox non responsive and long running script problem. There is definitely something that is causing my problem because if all Mozzilla Firefox browsers were working like mine no one would be using them. Luckily I'm not using mine for business purposes or I would already have been forced to make a change. I've used Internet Explorer and Google's Chrome in the past but prefer FireFox and really have no desire to return to either one of those.

You can press the first letter of the tooltip you see when you hover a toolbar button. That way you can jump to this button. The Text Encoding button has a ""Show text encoding options"" tooltip, so you can press the 's' to jump to this button (not really intuitive). If there are more buttons that have a tooltip that starts with 's' then you need to press the 's' key more than once or move the button to a position at the start of the list.

I have talked to apple...they tell me to use safari.  I like firefox.  Now, my issue.  When I am on a web pags (this occurs randomly) I am bounced from the web page I am on to a previous web site I was on.  I do nothing nor click on anything to cause this.  It just happens.  When I am on facebook, this will happen and bounce me off facebook and put me on a web page i had been on during the same session.  This was not happening until I just got the latest Catalina update a week ago.  I do not know how to fix this issue.  Are there settings needing to be changed in the apple IOS?  If so what are they?  Is there something I can change in my facebook account?  Is there something I can change in my Firefox browser account?  Or should I just sit tight, grin and bare it until firefox makes changes via an update and fixes this issue.  I am beginning to think, I should have stuck with my windows 10 system instead of moving to apple.  I am just frustrated that I can not fix this issue.  Any ideas out there?

Certain operations caused Firefox to crash, but no crash reports are created &amp; I do not receive a Crash notification. One example is that when I receive an email that contains something I need to print like labels or tickets, Firefox crashes when I try to print &amp; if continue to try to print, it always crashes. Here is an example of a return label. <a href=""https://www.wayfair.com/session/secure/account/print_labels.php?label_id=11186731&amp;Or=2953552973&amp;Svc=&amp;csn_id=A691DFAE-672C-4481-9D3B-EB2D17913431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wayfair.com/session/secure/account/print_labels.php?label_id=11186731&amp;Or=2953552973&amp;Svc=&amp;csn_id=A691DFAE-672C-4481-9D3B-EB2D17913431</a>  Another example is downloading. If I try to download, Firefox crashes, again with no crash report or notification to me. Many times when I try again it works the second time. But sometimes it doesnt. Firefox just closes without a trace. Then I have to do restore last session. As I said, with some operations, it works if I do it again, but with others it does not.  I looked at Windows Event Viewer &amp; the application log. It has many evens for each day &amp; a total of 17,703. I found one from a couple of days ago that mentions Firefox &amp; another one that mentions Software Protection &amp; lists a number of items with a long list of letters &amp; numbers that look like Firefox crash reports   When I use Chrome, I dont have these problems. So I have made Chrome my default browser although I prefer Firefox if these problems can be fixed. Thank you.

I've installed hide/show scrollbars plug-in or add-on but it says reload the page to see change, and another one, custom-scrollbars but it doesn't have an icon in my icon bar nor control key. </p><p>As we speak I reloaded the page I was maybe 20 pages down in and the normal scroll bar isn't there but a custom one from custom-scrollbars is (I set a custom pink color), so maybe I solved it after all! There are gems 30 pages down (last week) and even better gems 40, 50 and more pages down but reloading the page I have to start pressing end-end-end... or keep scrolling down endlessly.  </p><p>Sorry to go on but I hope this is helpful for the next person where scroll bars disappear and if not, too bad for you, I'm just trying to share so that someone else can save time.

Oddly, ending the process in task manager sometimes works and other times it will not go away when I click “end process”  This is frustrating me to no end because I can’t understand why after deleting everything I keep getting the same errors  Any help is enormously appreciated thank you </p> id:1275052,created:2019-12-20 07:43:55 -0800,updated:2019-12-20 07:43:55 -0800,creator:evhenry,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I assume you've tried restarting your computer to see if that will restore it, and have you followed all the steps in this article? <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-already-running-not-responding?"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-already-running-not-responding?</a> </p><p>Let me know! </p>"

I assume this is because Google owns ""google"" as a domain. For example, it has ""domains.google"". So Firefox detects ""http://google"" as a valid website.

Sale el menú y seleccionamos Opciones 3. Se abrirará una nueva pestaña, una vez allí bajamos hacia abajo y vamos a la parte donde pone Archivos y Aplicaciones 4.

Went into prefs.js and deleted the print_printer line, but haven't touched the print.printer_(printername) lines yet (instructions said to delete the print_printer lines, so that is the only one I did). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1274380;1274452;,jamacfar,"id:1274452,created:2019-12-18 05:29:20 -0800,updated:2019-12-18 05:29:20 -0800,creator:jamacfar,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Well, the Zebra (label printer) and one of the HP LaserJets had a -1, the rest were all 1, so I left the Zebra (and the others) where it was and changed the HP to 1.  </p><p>Then I remembered seeing a setting paper_width...the Zebra and this same HP were 4.25, all of the other printers were -1.

It seems like some of these Options get re-set to something different, from time to time.  </p><p>For example, Options - General - Files and Applications - Applications - Choose how Firefox handles the files you download from the web or the applications you use while browsing. Content Type: PDF, Action: [we change it to what we want, such as ""use Bluebeam"" or ""use Adobe"" or ""preview in Firefox"", and then it will re-set to something else, such as ""Save File"" (which saves the file to Downloads and does not open the file in a program)] </p><p>And also Options - General - Firefox Updates - Keep Firefox up to date for the best performance, stability, and security.  Allow Firefox to... Automatically install updates (recommended) OR  Check for updates but let you choose to install them [in older versions of the browser, there was also a third option for NOT automatically checking for updates at all. But newer versions of Firefox do not seem to offer this.] Whichever of the first two options we choose, we have had cases where Firefox does not preserve the selection and switches the user to the other selection. </p><p>When the selections get re-set to something other than what the user chose, it likely happens due to a Firefox software update.  </p><p>I have been told by an IT consultant that the way to preserve the selections is to use Firefox Sync and under ""choose what to sync,"" make sure the ""Options"" box is ticked. But we have done that, and users with Sync turned on still find that not all of their Options selections are preserved. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,customize,en-US,1274227;1276517;1276538;1279838;1279963;,keriksen,"id:1279963,created:2020-01-10 19:03:16 -0800,updated:2020-01-10 19:03:16 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Looks that this reply in meant for another thread, so you can ignore it.

So that leads me to these other standard suggestions:  <strong>Double-check content blockers:</strong> Extensions that counter ads and tracking may break websites that embed third party content (meaning, from a secondary server).  Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site.  <strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site.  (1) Clear Firefox's Cache  See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>   If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes.  (2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that.  In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites.  Then try reloading the page. Does that help?  <strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem.  <em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox.

Agent starts but asks for my registration key (I have one) and then goes into setup.,"<p>Sometimes I download nzb files, which are Usenet index codes. You open nzb files with a Usenet newsreader program, it understands the nzb data, and downloads the actual message. The newsreader program I use is called 'Forte Agent'. I have a legal copy of Agent version 7 (not the latest v8) installed on my Windows 10 PC, with my 'registration key' saved, and the program options set up as I like them. Agent works fine when I run it from the desktop. </p><p>When I was using Chrome (last week), I could download and ""open"" nzb files from Chrome, which automatically launched my Agent newsreader program. Then I could use Agent to fetch the message, and open it. </p><p>When I try to do this with the Firefox browser, I can get Firefox to open Agent, but it is as if I was just now installing Agent for the first time. Agent asked for my registration key, and accepted it, then it asked for me to start the Agent program initial set-up. </p><p>I tried configuring Firefox to launch the program from c:\program files (x86)\agent\agent.exe but this made no difference. </p><p>I am now saving all nzb files to my download directory.

But there is no workaround at the moment so that you won't get this cycle of authorization code emails while at the library using different PCs. But you have to admit that to a security monitoring service, it would be super weird for a different PC to be connecting to your Firefox Account everyday.

So I lost my Firefox 52 install with all of my extensions (that still worked).  Now, I'm running v. 57 Quantum, and a few things aren't working correctly. </p><p>First, the MAJOR problem:  when I open a link from a bookmark, it's clobbering an existing tab that I was using (that's why it was open, obviously).  That is completely unsat and can not be allowed to continue.  How do I correct this?  I can't find the option under settings--&gt;tabs to fix this problem. </p><p>Second issue (major annoyance):  I can no longer create a bookmark directly in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar.  I used to be able to open that bookmark folder, and the first option was to bookmark the currently open tab.  That option has vanished, and i use that all the time.  How do I restore that? </p><p>Actually, one more issue:  I have two tabs that are pinned and are supposed to be protected (i.e., nothing can clobber them, and I can't close them without deliberately turning the protection off (context menu right-clicking on tab).  I need that back, because for some reason, firefox thinks it's ok to open a bookmark in those tabs, too, when it most definitely is NOT ok. </p><p>Thanks, Jim Graham </p><p><em>[Personal information removed by moderator.

I WAS running version 52, where all of my extensions that I use all of the time (and other stuff that I'm not sure was from extensions, just native in Firefox) all worked fine.  The systems crash screwed that up, as multiple backups (the only ones with my old Firefox install) both failed at the same  time (tame compared to what I once saw, where about 11 redundant backups all failed at the same time on me, and some of those were backed up, and their backups all failed, too ... I forget who originally posted horror stories about that back in the '80s, but I've seen it, too, firsthand). </p><p>I not only use those features, I rely on them in many cases, sometimes to save time, other times just to make things work right.  Now I'm just trying to get everything working the same as it did before, with or without those extensions, and I see absolutely no reason why that should not be possible.  And, once again, I DID set the setting in about:config that enables legacy extensions to true, so none of this should even be an issue in the first place. </p><p>And like I said earlier, I did try version 68...for a few minutes.  The first thing I noticed was that it didn't import my bookmarks.  So I opened ""Show all bookmarks"" and used the import feature there.  It didn't show any bookmarks to import.  And that's where I got out of 68 and deleted the installation/run files in ~/Downloads and went back to 57.  I don't have time for that ****. </p><p>If I could, I'd go back to my even older version 52.x with everything working fine.  But, like I said, multiple backups, including two cloud drive sites, all failed at the same time (system backed up to those the previous night just fine; they failed between then and the time I tried to recover the data). </p><p>I don't mean to sound harsh, if I do, I'm just frustrated by the fact that this stuff isn't working the way it's supposed to, extension or not. </p> id:1273854,created:2019-12-15 18:02:47 -0800,updated:2019-12-15 18:02:47 -0800,creator:gamedev91,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1273848"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> All extension files are signed, so if they appear to be corrupt then it looks that the signing is broken somehow.

That's the #1 problem solved.  So now we're just left with the second and third, how to bookmark a page from a bookmark toolbar folder and how to protect tabs from being closed or written over (used to be called ""lock tab"". </p><p>To better clarify what I'm talking about with the second one, here's an example.  Let's say I've got a bunch of game development stuff open in about 5 tabs.  As I'm going through these, I want to bookmark all of them in my gamedev folder that's on the bookmark toolbar.  Before, all I had to do was, for each of those 5 tabs, open the  gamedev folder, click on ""add bookmark here"" (or something like that....close enough) and it's bookmarked in that folder.  As it is now, I have to go up to the main menubar, click on bookmars---&gt;bookmark this page, then select the bookmarks toolbar, then select the folder in the bookmarks toolbar.  When bookmarking a lot of stuff, that quickly gets very annoying, especially knowing that just a few days ago, before the crash, I could do it the better, much simpler way. </p><p>As for the third, the solution above might just solve it.  Or not...I just remembered that, after trying Firefox 68 and almost immediately going back, when I re-opened it, the first two tabs (both pinned and should have been protected ... and that reminds me, it wasn't ""lock tab"" it was ""protect tab"" in the context menu), both were clobbered by stuff I didn't even open.  Ok, back button should fix that, but no, those two were no longer there at all under the stuff that clobbered them. </p><p>Oh, and a side comment I meant to add earlier.  When I was creating my account here today, I entered my email, clicked next.  Ok, fine, that worked.  Then, however, after entering my password, and clicking on create account, or whatever it was, while no errors were there, the button didn't work.  I had to go to Chrome (which I have to use for Prime Video as it doesn't work in Firefox) to create my Firefox account.  Just a bit of funny irony for the day.   :-) </p><p>Anyways, thanks for the first major solution.  Now I just hope I can get an answer on how to get the bookmarks from bookmark toolbar folders working properly. </p> id:1273771,created:2019-12-15 12:07:43 -0800,updated:2019-12-15 12:07:43 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Firefox 57 and later support a pref to open a bookmark in a new tab. </p> <ul><li>browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInTabs = true </li></ul> <p>You can open the <b>about:config</b> page via the location/address bar.

The only reason I would have had an additional saved login would be if the previous saved login didn't work.

Any time Firefox sees (or thinks it sees) any manual change in filling out a form, it asks if the user wants it to update the saved address or create a new one.  Asking before making changes is always a good thing, but the problem here is that Firefox doesn't offer any choice of ""DO NOTHING"" which is what I want 99% of the time when I manually edit a form, such as removing an automatically filled phone number or email address.

I could understand this, if Arial would also resolve to NimbusSansRegular (because they both match Nimbus via fontconfig), but as you can see they are displayed differently. 3) Since Arial and Helvetica are non existent on the machine, it should revert to the third option (sans-serif). But it still uses NimbusSansRegular for some reason.

Looked at the different devices that should sync under each account, that seems to be OK.

I can not find a setting in Firefox to allow the script to execute when invoked from hosted source.  I have tried an assortment of settings changes, but can’t find anything that works.  Can you help?

1274914,2019-12-12 08:13:18 -0800,2019-12-13T06:32:46Z,Latency and slowness when attempting to log in or use One Drive,"<p>System Win10 Pro i7-6600U 2.6GHz 8GB RAM 64-bit x64 processor </p><p>Browser Name: Firefox Version: 71.0 Build ID: 20191202093317 Update Channel: release User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0 OS: Windows_NT 10.0 Launcher Process: Enabled Multiprocess Windows: 1/1 Enabled by default Remote Processes: 7 Enterprise Policies: Inactive Google Location Service Key: Found Google Safebrowsing Key: Found Mozilla Location Service Key: Found Safe Mode: false </p><p>I have an Office 365 personal account. When attempting to use FF to log in to One Drive directly -- meaning, I go straight to the One Drive login page via bookmark, and do not attempt to enter One Drive via a ""side door"" such as a link on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> -- I encounter significant latency and, often, outright non-responsiveness. Last Pass will not autofill the login credentials; nor can I type them in directly with anything other than crippling latency, if at all. Same latency with password and 2-factor entry. If I am able to survive log-in, One Drive presents significant lag to clicks, often accompanied by fleeting clues in the lower-left corner of the screen, usually involving cryptography such as ""waiting for cdn-15 <a href=""http://office.net"" rel=""nofollow"">office.net</a> . . . "" or something similar. Often the word ""Excel"" or ""Word"" will be displayed in one of those messages, but they are so fleeting (and appear to be truncated for display) that I can't capture them completely. </p><p>Switching off extensions appears to have no effect. The lag and general unresponsiveness continues. </p><p>Interestingly, when I instead log in directly to Outlook (and not One Drive), and then move into One Drive via a One Drive link that is presented in the Outlook waffle button, then One Drive appears to behave promptly and normally. No lag issues that I can determine. (Also, with all FF extensions=true, login and use of Outlook is satisfactory. No problems that I can see). </p><p>The Windows One Drive app, which runs on the local system, also appears to function normally. I can see/modify files in my One Drive via the local app. That's groovy, but sometimes you need to see the file system in the web browser. </p><p>So I guess that's the workaround: Get access to One Drive by going *through* Outlook. Okay, but why? What's going on? How to fix? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1272964;1273021;1273023;1273057;1273060;1273221;,j.thomas.100,"id:1273221,created:2019-12-13 06:32:46 -0800,updated:2019-12-13 06:32:46 -0800,creator:j.thomas.100,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1273057"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Note that a bookmark can store POST data alongside with the URL and can also include GET data or link to a specific server.

Over the ensuing years, there have been a number of 3rd party extensions available for users to install <em>(related to what's known as Parent Folder)</em>,  but as of Quantum Firefox 57 the ability of what an extension can do is very limited vs. the older Legacy extension rules and API's. Displaying the ""Parent Folder"" doesn't seem to be available any longer, as no API exists. I guess or we would have that type of extension available now, 14 versions after the Quantum era began.   </p><p>So, <strong>no</strong> that isn't easy to fix beyond what the developers are willing to do as far as adding it to Firefox or what type of API the developers are willing to add to Firefox so that extension developers can do as they did from Firefox 3.0 up thru Firefox 56. </p> <hr> <p>One other thing that too many long term users don't think about is that one of the key new features with Places is the <strong>Tags</strong> feature. Which iirc was to allow users to categorize their bookmarks by using Tags, and lessen the need for a hierarchical order using nested folders for classifying bookmarks for easy retrieval. I never bothered with the Tags feature because extensions for Parent Folder existed very soon after Places came about; that is until those extensions didn't exist any longer.  But hey,no biggie for me as I am using an old version of Firefox from 2015 for the most important things I do on the internet, other than banking and for YouTube. </p> id:1273676,created:2019-12-15 02:26:28 -0800,updated:2019-12-15 02:30:53 -0800,creator:j-p_FF,updated_by:j-p_FF,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks a lot to all of you ! +++ </p><p>Indeed the most convenient way to workaround the gap is cor-el's solution.

I now use a brand new Windows 10 laptop. I have noticed that Youtube looks completely different on the new computer than it did on the Mac. Can anyone explain why? Also, when I go on Youtube on Internet Explorer on the new laptop, it looks the way it does on the Mac. What's going on? Is there a way to get it looking like it did on the Mac? I've also attached screenshots from both computers. The first pic is from the Mac, the 2nd is from the Windows 10 laptop. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1272526;,cje24576,"id:1272526,created:2019-12-10 18:42:13 -0800,updated:2019-12-10 18:42:13 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Looks like the screen width / horizontal resolution differs between the 2 devices.

Also, a difference with the ancient Trident-engine Internet Explorer vs. a more modern Quantum version of Firefox.

Firefox will allow the cookies."" </p><p>And this is where it gets a little tricky, at least as I see it. Because here in the EU, any given website doesn't just ask permission to install cookies necessary for the website to function. Websites also ask permission to install trackers and 'third-party' cookies. Usually, websites will ask permission for a slew cookies. I have copied and Google-translated headers for the different categories of cookies on offer from a local (Danish) newspaper: </p><p>- Storage of and access to information  - Personalisation - Ad selection, delivery and reporting - Content selection, delivery and reporting - Measurement - Google </p><p>In addition, the newspaper asks permission to share information with collaborators. Those are a lot of options. Presumably designed (in part) to make visitors simply click 'yes to all'. </p><p>Now, if Firefox allows cookies to be installed based on a simple request from a website, Enhanced Tracking Protection is virtually useless in the EU. That would mean that I - or anyone - wanting to block cookies and trackers would have to manually block them from every site. Or choose some other plug-in for Firefox. </p><p>Conversely, if Firefox does not grant access based on requests from websites, then I - or anyone - could simply click 'yes' to safely(!) get rid of both the omnipresent banner and the intrusive code. From a user’s point-of-view it would make a lot more sense if filters were absolute and not open for being amended by simple requests from any given website. </p><p>But understanding you correctly, you believe that Firefox will allow anything I - or anyone - accept when requested? Even though the specific type of cookie is listed as wanted blocked? </p><p>If this is indeed true, that would be very disappointing. And something that I would suggest consider changing. In the meantime, any suggestions to how I best protect myself from intrusive code? </p><p>Thank you very much for your help and time. </p> id:1272296,created:2019-12-10 04:37:07 -0800,updated:2019-12-10 04:38:51 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Maybe you missed it: </p><p>""Cookies Firefox blocks and doesn’t block </p><p>By default, Firefox blocks the cookies that track your browsing activity across multiple websites.

I understand how difficult Sync is and have read the deep dive article on how it is being (or has been) rebuilt to work ""properly"". I have just one question - but here's why: Sync still has the ability to mess up bookmarks between my 5 Windows machines.  So all I want is a clear way to do this:  I'd like to fix up all my bookmarks on one machine : let's call it ""A"" - and then propagate that to all the others.  I tried doing this by  A. Stopping sync on all,  B. Fixing up the duplicates, empty folders and other messed up things in bookmarks on A manually C. Starting Sync again.  And within a day my 5 hour marathon had been completely wasted as they were in a heck of a mess again.  Could someone please try and include ""A straightforward way to reset and rebuild your bookmarks- AND SYNC THEM!"" in the design doc? And put that a set of clear instructions somewhere? But in the meantime - please let me know how I do this. Surely ""reset  and rebuild from here"" is an obvious requirement? Thanks guys - this hurts because I'm completely in love with the ""new"" Firefox and how safe I feel with it. So help me here! </p>",windows-7;desktop;sync;firefox-710;,firefox,sync,en-US,1272272;1272459;,radiocam,"id:1272459,created:2019-12-10 15:41:27 -0800,updated:2019-12-10 15:41:27 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>If you would want Sync to go in one direction then you first need to clear the data on the Sync server and then only connect the one device that is intended to be the master. Once the initial Sync has finished disconnect this device and then connect other devices to get these bookmarks. If these other devices already have bookmarks then these will be uploaded to the server and merged to other devices, so to prevent that you would have to remove the bookmarks from all devices (create an HTML backup, so you can reload (import them at a later time). </p> id:1272272,created:2019-12-10 00:16:07 -0800,updated:2019-12-10 00:16:07 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There is no ""master"" with Sync. With laptop / desktop devices all are equal and all the devices merge their data as they get connected to Sync. And when you're trying to ""fix"" messed up bookmarks you need to be patient as each one is connected back to the Sync server as it may take a few days for everything to become stable, unless you clean one device and then clear your bookmarks from the other 4 devices. </p><p>1.  As far as fixing your bookmarks on device ""A"" goes, make sure you Disconnect from the Sync server while you are organizing bookmarks. And when you're done go into <strong>Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information</strong> and scroll down to <strong>Places Database</strong> and use the <strong>Verify Integrity</strong> button and wait for the results of the process. Make sure it is ""sane"" and ""coherent"". </p><p>IMO, the start and stop as you ponder how to rearrange bookmarks when Connected to Sync is where most users go wrong. Communication with the Sync server seems to stop after a few changes are made and when those actions stop the local device will start sending data to the Sync server again only to stop once more when the 'batch' threshold is reached again.  </p><p><em>Strictly my observations a few years ago when I was trying to duplicate user complaints and failures. I observed those ""stops"" when running Sync with two different Profiles with the different / separate windows tiled on the screen side-by-side; I could add or move a bookmark in one Profile and before I could even shift my eyes to the other tiled 1/2 window it would add the new bookmark or show the moved bookmark. That is until I moved a few more bookmarks quickly and the the ""moves"" wouldn't appear for a few minutes. And when I would do a massive rearrangement of bookmarks, sometimes the Sync server would fix things all by itself in that sitting but at other times it did take a few days depending upon the amount of changes made, how many bookmarks were involved (total saved and how many rearranged), and especially how often I would sit and figure out what else belong in a different location between batches of moves. </em> </p><p>And do that Disconnect whenever you feel the need to move more than a few bookmarks at the same time, once you have fixed what's wrong now. </p><p>2.  Before Reconnecting device ""A"" to the Sync server change the Password for the Firefox Account, which will clear all the Firefox data from the server to give you a fresh start with a clean load from device ""A"". Depending upon how much data is synchronized let the initial connection run for quite awhile, like maybe an hour is what I have done. Then close Firefox and restart to get a ""launch connection"" with the Sync server, and maybe do that a few times. </p><p>3.  Then with the other 4 devices it is probably best to just get rid of all the bookmarks on each of those devices so that the Sync server doesn't have to deal with trying to merge any bookmarks data to the server from each of those devices. That way all Sync has to deal with is the few default bookmarks that come with Firefox, like under 10 bookmarks. &gt;&gt; With Firefox closed: A.   In the Profile folder get rid of the <strong>places.sqlite</strong> file which contains bookmarks, browsing history, and downloads history.  B.   Also in the Profile folder open the <strong>/bookmarkbackups/</strong> folder clear all the backup JSON / JSONLZ4 files there <em>(15 is the default number of backups saved)</em>. <em>Save them in a different folder on that device if you wish, but get them out so that Firefox doesn't restore a backup when Firefox is launched with the places.sqlite file removed.</em> </p><p>4.  As you Connect each of the other 4 devices back to Sync, you will need to use the new Password. Don't rush the process of the initial Sync and don't start rearranging bookmarks until all 5 devices are up and running with Sync again. <em>Most common change may be wanting different bookmarks on the Bookmarks Toolbar on each of the devices, so postpone making the changes until you're done connecting all the devices.</em> </p><p>I have walked a good number of users thru this process of fixing discombobulated / corrupt bookmarks and many users have cut the process short, thus wasting their time needing to re-do the process completely. </p>"

Most recently, on this computer, it asked me to send an SMS to my phone to login to Firefox Sync on my phone. </p><p>This would be reasonable, except for the fact that I'm already using Firefox on my phone, and have it actively logged in with the account I'm logging in to.

I can work around this by simply ignoring the prompt, but I'm concerned for other less tech-savvy consumers who might be confused, thinking they're still not done when they login to Sync on their second device!

Usually issues with Firefox are related to add-ons, but when I Remove an add-on, then restart Firefox, the add-on is still there. 5. (silly, minor issue) I'd like the tab bar to be dark, again.

If it does, it's probably caused by an add-on you have installed on Firefox.

If not, you can check that option. </li><li> Press the <strong>Reset</strong> button. </li><li> Restart your computer. </li></ol> <p>If that doesn't help, it's possible that your computer has an invalid DNS cache. DNS is the service that converts a website address into an IP address your computer uses to connect. To save time, that information is saved into a cache so that your computer doesn't need to request it each time you want to visit a website. However, if the data is damaged or the website has moved, it's possible that your computer still has invalid DNS information. </p><p>To fix this, we can ""flush"" your DNS, which will erase all of the old data. Then, when you visit a website for the first time, your computer will begin saving that information again. </p><p>To do this, do the following: </p> <ol><li> Press the Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog. </li><li> Type <code>cmd</code> into the box. </li><li> Press <strong>Ok</strong>. </li><li> Type <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> and then press enter.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu) </p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible.

Firefox got a new bookmarks storage system with Firefox 3.0 in June 2008 (places.sqlite) that was a major departure from what Netscape and the original Mozilla Suite used; which Firefox which was named Phoenix at the beginning and then was re-branded as  Firebird for a short time before becoming Firefox in 2004.  So 2008 should be considered the ""base"" date of the current bookmarks system. </p> <hr> <p>There is no ""master"" device with Sync, the synchronization of bookmarks is equal - save for ""mobile"" bookmarks <em>(Firefox for Android and Firefox for iOS devices)</em>.  The Sync server will know the 'age' of each bookmark, but there are no user controls for Sync beyond whether a data category is toggled on for inclusion in the synchronization process and whether Sync is Connected or Disconnected. </p><p>The situation on ""mobile"" categorizes or sets into separate folder displays per device the bookmarks that originate on ""mobile"" devices. An arrangement that is controversial with some users. </p> <hr> <p>That said, the initial synchronization of multiple devices for a new Firefox Account (FxA) may take a seemingly unreasonable amount of time; some reports of multiple days of use of Firefox on each device before the process seems to be completed.  BUT, that could have been due to the user getting frustrated and that user rearranging bookmarks manually per device in an attempt to ""fix"" what they didn't like which only exacerbated the issue. </p><p>Best use tip:   When manually rearranging bookmarks 'Disconnect' from the Firefox Account; then 'Connect' back to the FxA system to allow for synchronization of the ""batch"" of changes in one connection. </p>"

I notice that when I load a page into a new tab (either from middle-clicking links, or entering URL manually), Firefox UI is unresponsive for about 2 seconds. During that time, I'm unable to switch tabs--either by clicking, or with Ctrl+Tab. I tried restarting with all add-ons disabled, but the problem persists. </p><p>The problem disappears if i were to create a new temporary profile, though. So it's clear that something in my current profile is screwed up, but not sure what. Other things I've tried: quit Firefox, I vacuumed all `.sqlite` files in my profile; cleaned up all the cached images (not site data, though). </p><p>I'm keen to continue using my profile rather than create and setup a new one.

Not too long ago Firefox had an update where if you click on the URL bar then it would enlarge a bit. When it enlarges, so does the font, meaning that if I try to double click a word, the font resizing could shift the text. It is something minor, but something I am so used to doing. I was wondering if I could go back to the old URL bar that only got a blue highlight on click. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1271742;1271848;1271854;1271938;1303939;1304826;1304829;1304880;1304888;1304905;1305333;1305890;1305896;1305988;1305993;1305997;1306000;1306006;1306012;1306524;1306532;1306741;1306867;1310997;1311417;1311857;1315988;1315999;1318226;1318227;1318229;1318269;1318624;1318637;1318757;1319117;1319521;1319930;1319948;1320032;,user2053450,"id:1320032,created:2020-06-05 07:51:46 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 07:51:46 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hey All, I hear your frustration, but support forum volunteers do not have the ability to change Firefox.

I also used the 'dd' command to do some back-up disk cloning in the past.  It worked perfectly on my previous version of Linux but failed disastrously on my latest release.  I have no idea why it worked, nor why it failed and no one on the forum seemed to be able to enlighten me.  I have concluded that the terminal is, in the main, a place for experts only and have subsequently kept well clear of it as far as possible. Apart from anything else, facility with the terminal requires a lot of work and a lot of practice, which my minimal requirements cannot justify.  It might be another year or so before the next requirement will arise.  As a result, whatever I learn now will almost certainly be a distant memory (or, more accurately, no memory at all) by the time I want to use it. At my level of knowledge, running a repository-only system in GUI mode seems to be by far the safest option.  That meets 99.99% of my requirements. Linux is stable and reliable.  Some of the utilities that run under it are decidedly less so.  Libre Office Writer is an example.  One utility in particular almost invariably crashes my computer as soon as the desktop icon is clicked, requiring a reboot.  It has done so on both the previous releases.  I reported it but no one appeared to have a clue as to  the reason nor even admitted that a software bug existed.  Waste of my time, really. The thought of trying to fix things from the terminal does not appeal to me.  What's the old saying?  ""Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.""  OK.  I'm happy to identify myself as a fool.

You can see where plugins are stored for your firefox by running ""echo $MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH"". The way to manually install flash is to get it from adobe in the tar.gz archive and copy the <a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a> file into that path. Something link ""cp <a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a> $MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH"" should do the trick. If you've installed it via other method, you should still see the actual plugin in this path. Just run ""ls $MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH"" to see if the plugin is listed. You can define where plugins are stored in your bashrc file as well. I recommend leaving it in the default spot which is usually something like /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins. </p> id:1273360,created:2019-12-13 14:20:13 -0800,updated:2019-12-13 14:20:13 -0800,creator:Thermoman,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Whoa!  That puts me well above my pay grade.  I am just a humble user and a very long way from being a developer.  I only use the command line when I am absolutely forced to.

If you would provide me with step by step instructions, I'll have another go but, in the mean time, you might like to look at my earlier reply (above) where I quote 3 command line instructions which, when sequentially entered, certainly got Flash installed for me. You might also like to look at my later post where I described my annoyance when my automatic Linux Mint update, under Sylvia, was issued on the very evening of the day that I made the manual entries.  The Flash update is certainly in the repository somewhere, it would appear, although I couldn't find it when I looked.  All I can tell you is that both manual and automatic options seemed to work, in as far as after both updates, manual and automatic, the Flash player was clearly working where it had not been for months previously.  I have just rechecked and can confirmed that that is still the case. </p> id:1273239,created:2019-12-13 07:56:29 -0800,updated:2019-12-13 07:57:03 -0800,creator:japaneselearning101,updated_by:japaneselearning101,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Let's verify that the plugin is installed locally.

In my case it was quite a big job but not that extensive.) I hope I have got all the spaces in the right place, in what I have copied above, but that is one of the less joyful aspects of Linux.  If you are forced into command line operation then if, like me, you happen to be an 80 year-old, newbie user it could well turn out to be a case of 'heaven help you'.

I used Firefox's menu to display Addon-Plugins, which informed me that Flash was installed but was vulnerable due to being out of date.  If I click the ellipsis to 'Ask to Activate' or the tab below it, accompanying the message telling me that the installed version was unsuitable, and inviting me to update it, all that happens, in both cases, is that I am redirected to Adobe's Flash update page and invited to invoke stage 1 of the update process by downloading the appropriate new version.  But since I have already done this, Adobe tells me the new version is already installed, presumably from my initial attempt to update.  I have no idea what has been downloaded or in what folder/directory it is to be found.  It is certainly not in Downloads.  Even if I found it, what would I then do with it?  Adobe provides me with no obvious path to proceed to stage 2 nor any means to request any other sort of download other than the one it offers.

Now if FF crashes for some reason or there is a power outage, sometimes session restore only works for one profile that is restarted first, while the others lose all the tabs that were open last time. Now I have a feeling that this is much more likely to happen if the browser was recently updated (it happened several times on the first restart after the update). I reckon that this might have something to do with the session restore only restoring one of the opened windows (which, as I understand, is now fixed). In each of the profiles the automatic session restore is set on. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-710;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1271685;1271693;,andrei.smolensky,"id:1271693,created:2019-12-07 22:44:33 -0800,updated:2019-12-07 22:44:33 -0800,creator:andrei.smolensky,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>Dinushi Dhananjani <a href=""#answer-1271685"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Hi dr..... just try this....

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected.  </p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there. </p> <ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install. Stylus also doesn't work, and all my styles have vanished. Tampermonkey worked running a script on Youtube, but once again, on startup, the script was gone. </li></ul>",windows-7;desktop;other;extension;localstorage;webextension;,firefox,other,en-US,1271688;1271689;1271859;1271877;1271885;1271975;1272848;,skyward.sean,"id:1272848,created:2019-12-11 21:35:50 -0800,updated:2019-12-11 21:35:50 -0800,creator:skyward.sean,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1271975"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> There are also these prefs that might be helpful to transfer the storage folder from one setup to another profile.

Now, I'm afraid to use it at all, just in case the more I do, the more the previous sessions will be lost.  YIKES!  I just moved, got my computer back up and running, and now this.

Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment. </p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again. </p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem.... </p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.  And just FYI, the rep also agreed that my ad blockers should not have been an issue.  Reluctantly, I went to MS Edge - I was able to log in.   I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible. </p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password."" 	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW 	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing 	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway 	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.' 	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.  However, I do not use the 'saved log ins' feature or use a master password - I get the impression that is what would be affected if I followed the provisions outlined, and so may not apply to my issue.

This is done with the Task Manager. However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks. Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10. I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes. </p><p>This is not a serious problem.

In Chrome, I can log out, delete the history and cache, and close the window and it's like I was never there. But I think I have my sync settings setup differently for Chrome than for Firefox. I prefer to use programs that allow me plug-and-play-type access to my personal data - that I can then ""turn off"" by logging out. For a long time, that's how Firefox was functioning for me, and it's one of the reasons I switched to using it over Chrome. Now that I understand bookmarks and add-ons are not (usually) treated that way in Firefox using sync, I'll have to rethink how I use it. </p><p>Thanks for your responses, all. </p> id:1271152,created:2019-12-05 22:11:35 -0800,updated:2019-12-05 22:11:35 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I couldn't say what was happening in the past where you experienced things functioning the way you feel is correct, but once bookmarks and other non-volitile data are synced, they do not get erased by clearing history.  </p><p>When using Firefox and synchronizing data on devices not your own, you may want to delete cache and data using, e.g., Androids Settings → Apps → Firefox.  For general-purpose computers, you can start Firefox and create a new profile, switch to that profile, and then sync. You can switch back to default profile when done and delete your temporary profile. </p><p>Of course, you may be overwriting someone's static profile on a device not your own if they do not also sync to the cloud and it is not an empty profile, regardless of deleting or not on logout. </p> id:1270978,created:2019-12-05 11:05:42 -0800,updated:2019-12-05 11:05:42 -0800,creator:lisa.paladin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>And again, while I was viewing and accessing all synced data, the Sync / login screen in Firefox was displaying that no one was yet logged in, and prompted me to log in to begin the sync process. </p> id:1270977,created:2019-12-05 11:04:18 -0800,updated:2019-12-05 11:04:18 -0800,creator:lisa.paladin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It certainly does seem like an impossibility...which is why I came here to ask about and report it. ;) From my perspective, it seems the only likely answer is that it didn't fully disconnect / log out of the last use - but I don't actually know what happened, or how, as I did nothing differently. I just know that I was not yet logged in this morning, and it was displaying information that it hadn't in the past, and which I believe is connected to the login and history, both of which I had manually cleared.  </p><p>To answer your first question, initially I did think that the bookmarks would stay synced across devices...however across all my uses of Firefox, this is actually the *first* time they have stayed synced after logging out / disconnecting. In the past, disconnecting / logging out of sync has removed the bookmarks toolbar and all add-ons. It may be that every *other* time it was not performing correctly...but the action had previously and consistently removed those things until my next login, which is why I expected it to perform that action again between yesterday and today.  </p><p>To answer your other question, this is the first time Firefox has behaved in *this* way. As I mentioned above, all other times I've used it (daily for months, across multiple devices), the bookmarks toolbar and add-ons have also logged out. In fact, upon each new login, each of the add-ons had opened new tabs indicating that they had been added and connected, as if for the first time, which I found annoying, but not unusual since it had always done that. </p><p>I have also selected the option to remove all data on Disconnect. It's possible that there is a setting I'm missing somewhere, but I did not change settings between yesterday and today until *after* noticing that everything already appeared synced prior to logging in. Then I went into settings and attempted to divine which settings might fix the error. ;) </p> id:1270967,created:2019-12-05 10:51:36 -0800,updated:2019-12-05 10:51:36 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Perhaps I'm not understanding your question because in your original post you specifically refer to your bookmarks being visible when you accessed Firefox later (unless of course you select the option to remove all synced data as well). However, that should have always been the case, since clearing history doesn't have anything to do with your bookmarks. </p><p>Does this still consistently happen or was this a one-off occurrence? </p><p>If you aren't logged into Firefox Sync, Firefox won't be able to sync your data.

This has been the case for many months using a Firefox Sync login across multiple devices (three laptops, one desktop, and a mobile device). Today was the first instance in which all of it was accessible without logging in. </p><p>While I understand that the intention of Sync is to be able to access this information across devices, the intention of the ""Disconnect"" function is to stop syncing to the device, and the intention of clearing history and logging out is to...well, clear history and log out. ;) When I open the Firefox browser after performing all of those actions, I do not expect the opposite to be true - i.e. it should not already be logged in. </p> id:1270953,created:2019-12-05 10:26:40 -0800,updated:2019-12-05 10:26:40 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>When you login to a device using Firefox Sync, that data is transferred to that device.

In that case, unless you manually removed all of the Firefox data after logging out of Firefox Sync, it's entirely normal that your data would still be there later. </p><p>As for your add-on data syncing, that's intended to happen. The developers that make add-ons can determine what add-on data (if any) gets synced between devices. Obviously the developer of the add-on has included their login credentials in the list of data that needs to be synced. </p>"

The other is AnonymoX which I use for general purposes. </p><p>A few days ago I upgraded to Firefox 71.0 as well as updated my Windows 10 to the latest 1903 version. Today I noticed that both extensions have stopped working. AnonymoX just doesn't work, whereas the other plugin, upon activation, says (translated) ""Conflict detected! Proxy settings are controlled by a different plugin or cannot be set up"" Trying to circumvent a block (and only then - unblocked websites work fine) now either redirects me to the ISPs blocking page, or alternatively produces a ""Secure Connection Failed PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR""  message after a long TLS handshake. Running the same extensions in Chrome does not reproduce the issue - blocked websites become accessible as usual. The issue also persists for three different connections - a public wi-fi network, a private network and a tethered 4G connection, all served by different ISPs. Finally, I am not running any anti-virus software or firewall. Thus this seems to be a Firefox issue and not a system or network issue.  </p><p>This also doesn't seem to be an issue with the country's blocking system itself because other users around me are still able to circumvent blocks using the same extensions and I am able to circumvent blocks using a similar extension on my Android phone with a local SIM.  </p><p>Things I've tried so far: 1) Made sure that both Windows and Firefox are set to not use a proxy </p><p>2) Reinstalled the extensions </p><p>3) Created a different profile in Firefox. The extensions don't work in the new profile either, although the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR does not appear - I just always get redirected to the respective ISPs block page </p><p>4) Cleared all cache, cookies, site settings etc. </p><p>5) Deleted the cert9.db file and let Firefox recereate it </p><p>So far nothing has worked. I'm frankly at a loss here. I have half a mind to just reinstall Firefox altogether since this is not my main PC and losing bookmarks wouldn't inconvenience me on it, but figured I'd ask here before. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,customize,en-US,1270928;1270932;,nlkonovalenko,"id:1270932,created:2019-12-05 09:14:10 -0800,updated:2019-12-05 09:14:10 -0800,creator:nlkonovalenko,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi philipp and thank you for the quick reply! </p><p>AnonymoX has not been updated since 71.0.

1274301,2019-12-04 14:02:33 -0800,2019-12-06T17:38:45Z,What caused profiles to torque two days ago?,"<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask the question that comes at the end of this note.  If you scroll to the end, you can see it marked as MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW. </p><p>As I was posting the question, I took advantage of the moment to reflect on the fact that FireFox's perseverance over its long history of ups and downs today has made FireFox one of the real hopes for humanity.  Long Live FireFox! </p><p>Back in the dark ages, before the ascendance of Google's Chrome browser, I learned to recover FireFox's guts, to cope with its gastric spasms of projectile digital vomiting, which seemed to occur every few weeks.  Most software in those days contributed full shares to the unusable stew, made the accumulation of digital barf that needed cleanup as often as I needed to clean up after hangovers from over drinking when I was a stupid youth. Those were the days when running a computer all day without being forced to restart taught me to weild Windows Task Manager as weapon, which usually provided a side step around enough of the binary vomit top cut restarts from 4 a day to only one or two. </p><p>Years later, while Microsoft was recovering from the largest, most expensive public mistake in software history (Windows 8), Google got a handle on Chrome.  After that, around 2014, Google either found Popeye's spinach factory, or aliens joined them in their Mountain View offices, because no human force can account for the rate and quality of significant upgrades to all their systems since then, for Chrome browser, underlying Chromium technology now used by everyone, not just for browsers, but all manor of application software to run on all kinds of platforms, Android for phones and apps, YouTube video processing that spots copyrighted sound and images in every video that has it, the world-leading advertising systems and dashboards, and their search engine so much better than anyone else's our choice is to use Google Search or be stupid and slow, or use Google Maps or be lost.  Google pumps out new and better software features one hundred times faster than any other organization.  If you missed the media reports explaining this, that is because Google's super productivity has not been celebrated in anything like the degree warranted.  </p><p>Unfortunately, Google also has become so evil  it probably cannot be prevented from destroying the system of human checks and balances invented in the United States 240 years ago. As simple and feeble as those checks and balances are, without them it is hard to see how any substantial part of the human population ever could have experienced and lived with Liberty and the productivity it makes possible.  For example, without the Liberty growing throughout the world after taking its initial root in the United States and our written Constitution, one of the most ingenious and consequential documents ever written, the normal result of military conflict would have been one murderous, tyrannical, wholly self-serving dictatorship or another forcing 99% of the human population to live as serfs or slaves in the involuntary service of people like you know who.  Google and the rest of the power players in commercial media are destroying that, through political bias they lie about.  The problem with their lies is they have the power of their media platform to perpetrate them.  Google is evil and needs to be neutralized.  The main thing I can do about this is to stop using their products.  The other thing I can do is tell people about what is happening.  I was raised to see things this way, but for until recently, I did not see this is the way we have to look at things because this is the way that works.  Until recently, I did not know society cannot stop functioning, but now I know that the functioning we all take for granted, including the people fighting against it, is rare as diamonds when viewed in the context of human history, Some of the people attacking our country want to break it down, because they want the United States to become like the places people now leave in order to come here.  The sickness is the same that has affected all gluttons for power.  They have learned that force of military arms tends to galvanize people like you and me.  Instead, they lie to us. pretending to harbor the same loves for life you and I have, when in truth they see us is idiot patsies, making us deserve their the damages wrought by their treachery. </p><p>Therefore, I stopped using Chrome, returning to the FireFox way of browsing.  I was with Chrome so long, I forgot all about recovering browser profiles.  FireFox is a lot more reliable today than it was before Chome blew everybody out of the water, but its profile system still ha regular bouts with projectile digital vomiting. </p><p>Today, my FireFox is not blasting bile all over the house, but is being rather brave holding the contagion within itself. I noticed passwords not filling into web forms that used to be there. I am not sure of the timing.  I probably was a long time ago, but I kept getting messages from FireFox babbling about their new security system. </p><p>Today, I needed to identify active profile (i.e., the one I use) from the half dozen profiles piled into my FireFox installation.  I don't know why there is more than one.  Unfortunately, I just could not glean the one I need to look at from their names: </p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/ n34593ht.default-release/ n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/ q412vz1p.default/ uiaqaxwu.default/ </p><p>The online guide provided the usual waste of time.  I asked the computer how to know which profile is the active one.  I immediately found thousands of articles which each spell out the same eight or ten reasons why a person might wish to know which profile is active. The people writing these articles know their articles are filled mostly with spam (information we already have or don't need), but their editors are evaluated on word count, needed for diluting the concentration of ads in their publication.  It's been years since the ANSWERS were easy to pick out of spam portions of the articles they appear with.  From this agony-inducing swill I found information that looked like it might tell me how to spot the active profile.  ""Look for "".default"" as part of the profile name.

The change was to attach a profile to specific version of Firefox. This mattered because you can run multiple version of Firefox on the same computer. For example, I use the regular Firefox for my day-to-day usage, but the Firefox Beta version for anything I do with Mozilla. </p><p>The idea was that when you install a different version of Firefox (not a number version, but a rather a type of Firefox), Firefox makes a new clean profile and links it to that specific installation of Firefox. That way what you do in one version will not carry over to a different installation of Firefox on the same computer. Previously, all Firefox installations shared the same profile. </p><p>While this works great in most cases, some people found that Firefox automatically made a new profile (essentially detecting it as a new Firefox installation) or that, depending on how they opened Firefox, it might detect it as a new installation. For example, if you click a link from an email program, it may treat that as a different Firefox installation. </p><p>In your specific case, it's difficult to point out exactly why you are getting new profiles so often in Firefox. </p><p>However, if you do have a problem with Firefox not opening in the correct profile, the bottom of the <a href=""/en-US/kb/recover-lost-or-missing-bookmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">Recover lost or missing Bookmarks</a> article will have the steps for you to change back to the correct default profile. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Except for Firefox. No matter which page, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Twitter... no sound for videos. Firefox is quiet. If I check my sound settings, the bar for sound input is not even moving, seems like Firefox is just not recognising or forwarding any sound to my USB G560 speakers. </p><p>On the other hand, everything works in Google Chrome and sound is brilliant. The problem just seems to be with Firefox. I disabled all audio devices, especially my old audio-out where I had my old speakers. I updated the drivers for Realtek HD Audio (even though I am sure I do not need them for the G560) and also updated again driver for the G560 as well as the Logitech G Hub. Firefox is also the latest version. </p><p>But nothing. Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560. </p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices.

If you have closed all open windows and then close (Quit) Firefox then there is nothing to restore and you can possible look for ""Recently Closed Tabs and Windows"". </p><p>On other platforms it can happen that you use the close X, but still have other windows open. This can be an unnoticed or forgotten browser window or another standalone window like the Library (bookmarks and history manager). Only by using the menu item to Exit/Quit Firefox you can make sure that you close Firefox properly. The close X first closes this active window and then check whether there are other windows open and if found sets focus to the last used window. Only if no other windows are found open then Firefox is closed and session data flushed to the profile folder. Closing Firefox via the close X is less safe than using the menu item. </p> id:1286635,created:2020-02-02 12:32:41 -0800,updated:2020-02-02 12:33:13 -0800,creator:nerdgallardo,updated_by:nerdgallardo,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This is bullshit!

When Firefox prompts you to approve cookies on Facebook, it displays <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com</a>. However, apparently that is not enough to cover all of the cookies on the site and Firefox is not prompting for the more general domain <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>.

I found one missing piece on the Firefox product in general. It doesn't sync my settings when I log into the new device. The settings I'm talking about are Search Engine and Notification, although I think this can be applied to any other settings that I'm not using or aware of. Long story short, since I quit using Google Chrome (although I can't quit using Android, I still disable Google services and provide with least of permissions to any services on the mobile device) I switched back to Mozilla Firefox browser and using in on all my devices (Windows, couple of Linux Desktops as well as Android) and I found that when I login to my Firefox account I still have to change Search Engine from Google to DuckDuckGo and I wonder why Extensions are being installed and synced while search engines are not. Also same thing for Notifications. I don't like being notified and disable all kind of notifications for all Web Sites (no exclusions).  Can you please include these pieces to sync when login to the account or have a checkbox in case if some users want to keep different settings on different devices etc...? </p><p>Thank you, </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-700;,firefox,other,en-US,1270331;1270365;1270374;,schalykh,"id:1270374,created:2019-12-03 07:33:26 -0800,updated:2019-12-03 07:33:26 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>The search engine setting isn't synced to other connected devices.

For some reason I can't recall, I ended up with one window with one tab, and one window with all the tabs I'd had open on my old machine (including the one that was open by itself in the other window).  I closed the window with the single tab, and continued using the window with many tabs.  At the end of the day, I closed the window as usual and shut down the computer. </p><p>The next day, I turned on my computer, opened up firefox, and no tabs!  I checked to make sure that ""open previous session at startup"" was checked in the main settings, did some searching through the help files here, and found that the problem was that I hadn't gone in to the privacy settings to tell it to remember history.  I fixed that, and did some more digging to figure out how to restore history, I don't remember how.  I restarted Firefox, and it restored a previous session ... but not the one I wanted.  It restored the window with the single tab that I'd only had open for about ten minutes, not the window with all my tabs (including that one) that I'd had open all day.  Some more searching through the support here and I figured out how to restore the session I ACTUALLY wanted.  I can't find the post now, but it told me to go to Help - Troubleshooting Information (I think--it LOOKED like the Troubleshooting Information page, from what I remember, although today it doesn't seem to have the option I used yesterday, so it might have been a different page) and see if there were two sessions, and if so, to click the other one, and see if that fixed things.  It did!  I got the window with all the tabs back, and closed the window with just the single tab, and went on with my day.  Problem solved, right? </p><p>No.  I booted up my computer today, opened up Firefox, and what did I find?  IT OPENED THE WINDOW WITH THE SINGLE TAB THAT I'D ONLY HAD OPEN BRIEFLY, INSTEAD OF THE WINDOW WITH ALL MY TABS IN IT THAT I'D HAD OPEN ALL DAY.  First of all, I'd rather not have to deal with this again, so how can I make sure it doesn't?  What is going on? </p><p>Second, I can't find the help page that told me how to restore the correct window.  This is a problem, because although all of the tabs I had open yesterday are in my history, when I go to the little library icon and look at ""history"" both the ""recently closed windows"" and ""recently closed tabs"" are empty.  As far as Firefox is concerned, I haven't closed any windows or tabs since the last time the history was deleted, despite having lots of pages in the Recent History list that I sure don't have open right now.  Clicking the three horizontal lines to get the main menu, there is no ""restore previous session"" as an option.  I can go through the history and manually click on all the tabs that should be open, but that is REALLY a pain and I would like not to have to do this again.  I have added the ""Tab Session Manager"" addon, so hopefully even if this is a recurring problem I can use that to get around it.  (The addons listed below are all the addons I had when the problem occurred.)
