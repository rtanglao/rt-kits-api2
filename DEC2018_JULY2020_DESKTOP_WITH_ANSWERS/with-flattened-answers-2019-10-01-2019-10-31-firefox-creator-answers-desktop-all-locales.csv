Since the GPU is non-metal I am forced to use Dark Mode, which turns the Firefox 68esr bookmarks/history sidebars (among other Firefox items) to almost unreadable black text on black background. Partial workaround I have found is this CSS, below, which works perfectly for the history sidebar, but not for the bookmarks sidebar. (Note, the same CSS works perfectly in Waterfox Classic, using Classic Theme Restorer, Custom CSS Code, for both history and bookmarks, where the different sidebars can be selected from buttons, instead of only from a dropdown in the FF68.) </p><p>EDIT: PLEASE NOTE, after posting, the CSS is not formatted correctly. Not seeing any way to format as code, nor do I see any other formatting options for this original post. Several of the number/hash signs (#) are replaced by 1, which is not correct.

These DNS Servers eliminate dead-end ""no such name"" error pages you can encounter as you surf the web. This search service is designed to make your web surfing experience more productive. No software was installed on your computer for this service to work. What is DNS? </p><p>All Web sites have an address that consists of a series of numbers separated by periods, such as 153.39.1.1. This is known as an IP address. Most Web sites also have a domain name (such as <a href=""http://www.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">www.verizon.net</a>) associated with their IP address. With DNS, users don't have to type the complicated IP address into their browser's address bar; instead, they can type the domain name. DNS then acts like a real-time phonebook, looking up the name entered and translating it into the numbers that the computer recognizes so that the desired Web site can be displayed. Would you like to opt out of this service? </p><p>If you would like to opt out of this service, please visit the Opt Out of DNS Assistance support page.   </p><p><br> ""Opt Out of DNS Assistance"" is a link.

Je to spíše k neprospěchu než ku prospěchu. To je prostě důvod, proč spousty lidí přechází na jiné prohlížeče, hledají jednoduchou variantu, nic složitého. Jak píši, čím více funkcí tím větší průser a větší problémy. </p> id:1262849,created:2019-10-31 11:02:55 -0800,updated:2019-10-31 11:02:55 -0800,creator:poljos-moz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>martin.krizek <a href=""#answer-1262810"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Při vyhladávání pomocí obnovy se nikdy nic neděje </blockquote> <p>Píšeš tady nesmysly a sám netušíš, co vlastně děláš.

Sometimes the problem is one of compatibility, such as occurs when a website’s developers use proprietary coding techniques that not every browser knows how to interpret. You can check for this type of issue by using a different browser to visit the website in question. That’s one of the reasons why it's a good idea to keep Safari, Firefox, and Chrome web browsers handy. If a page loads in one browser but not another, you know it’s a compatibility problem. </p><p>One of the most likely causes of a web page not loading is a wrongly configured or poorly maintained DNS (Domain Name Server) system by your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Most internet users have the DNS system assigned to them by their ISP. Sometimes, this is done automatically; sometimes, an ISP gives you the DNS server’s internet address to manually enter into your Mac’s network settings.

Your simple solution (change the Home Page setting in FF) cured the issue.  For any others that experience the same issue - as I noted in my email to you - I have not changed my FF home page in years and as the problem (the annoying new L &amp; P tab) showed up continually - immediately after FF updated to ver 71.0, I can only guess that the update to 71.0 changed the home page to one that is populated with the new ""Logins &amp; Passwords"" tab.  In any event, simply resetting the home page as you suggested (3-bar menu &gt;Options &gt; Home) solved the problem.   Kudos to you. Good Catch McCoy - most appreciated! </p> id:1278541,created:2020-01-05 03:00:01 -0800,updated:2020-01-05 03:00:01 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>To anybody who might be interested : </p><p>You can have  Lockwise  and still be able to view/change/delete entries like you used to with the old passoword manager : </p><p>Type in the address bar : </p><p><strong>chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.xul</strong> </p><p>Press  Enter and maximixe the window. </p><p>When you highlight an entry you will see a  ""Show Password""   button at the bottom. </p><p>(you could bookmark this page) </p><p>Note that a few Firefox updates from now  (probably  Firefox version  73)  this will change to : </p><p>""chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.<strong>xhtml</strong>"" </p> id:1278530,created:2020-01-05 01:35:50 -0800,updated:2020-01-05 01:35:50 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>tmk40126 <a href=""#answer-1278520"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> BUT... every time I launch Firefox I still get the annoying ""Logins &amp; Passwords"" tab.  </blockquote> <p>Hello  tmk40126, </p><p>It looks like your problem has nothing to do with the old password manager being replaced by Lockwise,  but with your homepage  (at startup Firefox opens your homepage). </p><p>Would you please check your setting here : </p><p>3-bar menu  =&gt;  Options/Preferences  =&gt;  Home </p><p>When you set your homepage to whatever page you like,  you shouldn't get the  ""Logins &amp; Passwords""  tab at startup anymore. </p><p>I hope I'm right ..... </p> id:1278529,created:2020-01-05 01:34:50 -0800,updated:2020-01-05 01:34:50 -0800,creator:tmk40126ff,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>My ""Logins and Passwords"" in the ""3-bar"" Firefox menu button drop-down list only allows me to delete saved logins.

The only new thing that I had installed this week was the firefox-recommended addon to limit Facebook's reach, which caused problems so I disabled it. Everything was fine after that until this morning. I tried to restore. I even copied my bookmarks backup to another folder and tried to manually select that file to restore bookmarks. Each time, it says that it is ""unable to process backup file."" None of the troubleshooting recommendations worked. Firefox has not crafted a secondary profile for me, for example. I took the desperate step of downloading Edge, which can import and process these bookmarks just fine, but this is not a desirable solution. And no, Firefox was not able to then handily import my Edge bookmarks. It claimed to have done so, but then showed nothing. </p> id:1284313,created:2020-01-24 16:53:29 -0800,updated:2020-01-24 16:53:29 -0800,creator:4animallover,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>No I had to a file restore on it. and i was able to restore it, and got it all back.

Still, these are all windows 7 boxes, they will just take turns blowing the profiles away as they are booted and logged into next time. </p><p>Edit:  It's been about two years since I switched from Chrome to Firefox, I just imported that old profile information back up into Firefox, and I'll just have to rebuild what was lost as the journey continues, I'll go with new beginnings on this one vs. oh no it's all gone. </p>"

As I understand, this was done to close this ""bug"": <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699</a>. Though I guess this change can be beneficial for most users, it's also causing unnecessary problem to me a my colleagues at work. </p><p>We are technical support team and we are working in the ticketing  system called BMC Remedy. All file attachments sent by our customers are uploaded to our internal FTP server and then linked to the tickets via direct FTP links. Before release of the 70th version it was very convenient for us to click on those files, and get files opened straight inside browser. It worked flawlessly, especially for image and text files and saved us a lot of time. It was also the main reason we used Firefox, since in Chrome always (at least recently) saved files instead of displaying them. </p><p>But the release of 70th version messed up everything for us, and now all the files need to be saved before they can be opened which causes a lot of inconvenience. So much so, we had to downgrade back to 69th version to work normally. </p><p>As I said at the beginning, I do understand the reason behind this change since FTP vulnerabilities can harm users on public websites. However, inside closed environments like intranets there is no such threats, and losing ability to quickly preview FTP resources can hurt productivity. So in my opinion, while it's a good idea to have this behavior enabled by default, there should be an option under about:config to enable rendering of the FTP resources back. Or maybe someone at least can make an extension or Greasemonkey script that would bring this functionality back. </p><p>I'm not sure if this is correct place, but I don't know where else to post this to bring attention to this problem. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1261969;1261980;,securedbaby,"id:1261980,created:2019-10-28 17:50:40 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 17:50:40 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi John, I don't know whether you can expect this to change.

This LIVE DVD crashes or drops out from time to time so each time this happens I have to re-sync the Firefox it brings up.  This re-sync requires a verification code to be sent by email, but because that email has to go through my Google filtering process,  it usually takes longer than the code's 5 minute validity before I  receive it.   When I do finally get it and enter the received code back in Firefox,  I'm told the code is invalid or expired.   This is because 5 minutes validity is just too short a  time for my setup.

However, it's not possible to insert that into the message itself, since the message is essentially just text. Your email provider doesn't scan incoming messages for dates or times so that it can localize them for you. </p><p>If you think of an email as a regular letter you would send through regular mail, that's a pretty accurate picture of what an email is like. The person types of the letter and puts it in the mail. The receiving post office stamps it with the time received, which is local for that location. </p><p>It's also important to remember that when you send a letter through the regular mail, it takes time for the post office workers to actually deliver it to the user. Email is often the same. </p><p>The receiving time in the email header may be different then the time that the email actually appears in the user's inbox. It would depend on what spam and security filters the email needs to go through.

I find my access to Facebook content is completely blocked, whereas all other websites appear to be fine. Screenshot from one of the Facebook groups I follow is attached. I have spent hours trying to figure out your new security settings to enable access to Facebook, including switching off all blocking, and nothing is working, except to abandon Firefox and use Microsoft Edge (which is giving me perfect access). Also very ironically I have to use Microsoft Edge to log into Firefox support as Firefox tells me my cookies aren't enabled...except they are. I have been checking out Permissions to ensure everything is correctly enabled and I notice Load Images keeps reverting to Default rather than Enable – I don’t know if this is significant. At any rate Facebook images and data are not loading and it is clear all the pages are being blocked. I also wonder why my Avast online security is not being recognised by Firefox at the moment. I have been happy to use Firefox as my default browser for at least the last 10 years, but this is ridiculous, and I hope there is a simple solution to these issues or I will be changing to a different browser.

I don't think it's a malware problem, but the local storage issue might be relevant and I will try the suggestion made here. However, I am feeling really frustrated with this new security update because it has messed with a number of my other preferred settings and I'm not finding a way round it. I agree social media tracking has been a big problem. But there seems to be an assumption that we all want social media blocked from all sites, and the blocking of social media access includes access to comments or discussions of all kinds. I want to be able to access these from most websites, but I don't want to see ads. As far as I can work out blocking ads also means blocking all social media access. I fact I haven't managed to enable comments on any website on Firefox (except on private pages) so far, whereas as it is all too easy to switch on unwanted ads. Eg. my home page is <a href=""http://irishtimes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">irishtimes.com</a>, but without blocking it has some very prominent video ads all over the place. I used to be able to access comments on the articles, and now I can't see any of them. I just tried a couple of the recommended ad blocker addons (while switching off default blocking) and they are not doing a thing for me. Also my Avast online security addon is not active in Firefox any longer - this was previously a way to personalise blocking of major trackers on each website. It looks like the security addons are being overridden by the new Firefox security settings by default. </p><p>I appreciate it takes time to work out these kinds of software glitches, but I hope these problems are going to be taken seriously by Mozilla. Thanks. </p> id:1261468,created:2019-10-26 15:19:00 -0800,updated:2019-10-26 15:19:00 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>dryas1 <a href=""#answer-1261453"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Ok, I was checking online to see if anyone else had experienced a similar problem after upgrading, and found this on Reddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/dnchac/problems_with_some_sites_facebook_reddit_after/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/dnchac/problems_with_some_sites_facebook_reddit_after/</a>  They found opening a private window in Firefox worked for accessing FB when nothing else would.

It's sluggish and its cursor focus behavior is enervating. I click a field and start typing, then Gmail, with its (or my computer's, or browser's) slowness takes a second or two to apply focus to its desired field, so it starts inputting my typing in the wrong field or worse, interpreting my inputs as actions (archiving, deleting, starring, muting conversations, opening chats, opening Google Tasks sidebar, deleting open draft, etc., really freaking messy). Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before. </p><p>How can I prevent sites (or at least Gmail, specifically) from controlling/changing cursor focus? Is there an about:config key or an add-on for this, please? </p><p>BTW, I don't mind Gmail and/or Firefox being a bit slow, I recognize I contribute to it by have a few add-ons installed and running (though not so many).

It's a bit annoying. It's the universal design tendancy nowadays to make things as smooth and flush as possible. In many cars you won't find the door handles if you don't know were they are. In many gears it's the on/off button that's hidden. With web pages you won't guess what things are buttons until you pass the mouse over them.

This process sometimes leads to bugs that aren't discovered during beta testing, either because beta testers don't use a particular feature or OS or add-on, or because they decided to ""live with it"" rather than reporting it. We also see a lot of userChrome.css-related issues. </p> id:1261793,created:2019-10-28 08:53:35 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 08:53:35 -0800,creator:thorzdad21,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1261789"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I wonder why we aren't getting more reports of this.

They also do not show up when using a Chromebook, so I presume the problem is on my end. </p><p>I have cleared all cookies &amp; cache and did a complete scan with Norton, Malwarebytes, &amp; AdwCleaner. Even restored Windows 7 back to an earlier time. But none of this helped. </p><p>They are full page messages &amp; say they're from AT&amp;T, Walmart, or Visa. However the addresses all start out with: <a href=""http://happy.luckyparkclub.com/………"" rel=""nofollow"">happy.luckyparkclub.com/………</a>.. </p><p>Sometimes the messages appears right away &amp; sometimes it takes a few minutes. </p><p>I cleared FF cookies, went back to the forum, &amp; then looked at the cookies again. I noticed that <a href=""http://happy.luckyparkclub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">happy.luckyparkclub.com</a> and dbmtrk.xyz both appeared in the cookies list at the same time, 23 seconds. The forum cookie was time stamped at 22 seconds. </p><p>If I look at the forum using a different FF profile there is no problem &amp; neither of these 2 cookies are there. </p><p>If I open a New Private Window in the problem profile then I don't get the messages either, at least not yet. </p><p>What does the Private Window NOT access that the regular window does? </p><p>Which profile folder or file could be causing the problem? </p><p>Thanks for any suggestions. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;escalate;spam;firefox-690;,firefox,other,en-US,1261283;1261284;1261338;1261419;1261423;1261432;1261437;1261442;1261454;1261457;1261463;1261481;1261502;1261517;1261816;1261893;1261955;1262027;,Mike109,"id:1262027,created:2019-10-28 21:44:06 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 21:44:06 -0800,creator:sanuja800,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>try clearing your all history and remove cache and all data , after that you wont get any pop ups or spam messages IM experince </p> id:1261955,created:2019-10-28 16:08:31 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 16:08:31 -0800,creator:Mike109,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>As mentioned sometimes it takes a few minutes of reading the threads before the spam message appears. It's possible it might show up when using the second FF profile or Private Window if I looked at the forum threads for an even longer period of time. Anything's possible. </p><p>OTOH no one else on the forum has mentioned a problem. </p><p>I did edit the Hosts file using 127.0.0.1. It did block the spam message but gave me a full page error message instead. IOW nothing gained. </p><p>A few messages above, cor-el posted a link &amp; it appears quite a few people are having the same issue. </p><p>The first day or two that a I had the problem Firefox blocked the spam message. But then it stopped blocking it. It must have initially detected something, if that means anything. Since the whole forum webpage is replaced with a full page spam message along with a different  address, would this be considered a redirect vs. a popup? </p> id:1261893,created:2019-10-28 12:35:09 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 12:35:09 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I didn't see anything, but called for more help </p> id:1261816,created:2019-10-28 09:49:37 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 09:49:37 -0800,creator:Mike109,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Any luck finding a problem in the data? </p> id:1261517,created:2019-10-26 23:14:22 -0800,updated:2019-10-26 23:14:22 -0800,creator:Mike109,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>FredMcD <a href=""#answer-1261502"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> <em>Mike109 <a href=""#answer-1261437"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> <blockquote> I copied the <strong>about:support</strong> to my word processor </blockquote> <p>Open a text/word program and load the file.

Again, it's just one specific forum that has a problem when using my main profile. Everything else seems to work normally including other forums I visit. </p><p>When the problem first started a few days ago, Firefox would display a Red screen with a warning &amp; it blocked the spam message. But after about 2 days Firefox no longer displayed the Red warning screen, and what I got was the spam screen. I have no idea why this changed, but apparently something triggered FF in the early stages. </p> id:1261442,created:2019-10-26 14:28:14 -0800,updated:2019-10-26 14:28:14 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>You can check the connection settings here: </p> <ul><li>Options/Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Network: Connection -&gt; Settings </li></ul> <p>If you do not need to use a proxy to connect to internet then try to select ""No Proxy"" if ""Use the system proxy settings"" or one of the others do not work properly. </p><p>See ""Firefox connection settings"": </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can</a> </li></ul> id:1261437,created:2019-10-26 14:20:48 -0800,updated:2019-10-26 14:20:48 -0800,creator:Mike109,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>FredMcD <a href=""#answer-1261283"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Okay, let's try this;  On the system/profile with the problem:  Type <strong>about:support</strong> in the address bar and press <strong>Enter.</strong> Under the main banner, press the button; <strong>Copy Text To Clipboard.</strong>.

Now I got a second laptop for work. I want to be able to send tabs from one laptop to the other via the ""send tab"" feature. So I obviously have to log into Firefox sync. But I DON'T want to have all my bookmarks, settings, history and especially extensions synced on my work laptop. Since I want to have a different set of bookmarks on my work laptop (related to work) I need to turn off the syncing of the bookmarks (unfortunately I don't  think it's possible to sync two different sets of bookmarks). Same goes for the extensions, settings and history. So long story short, I want to only use the send-tab feature, and to sync opened tabs.  </p><p>Now here's the problem. When I log into Firefox sync after a fresh install on my work laptop and I enter my credentials, you are not asked what to sync. The default is to sync everything. After that everything is synced right away within a few seconds, and by the time I went to settings to turn the syncing of bookmarks, extensions etc. off, the bookmarks already synced and a ton of extensions start to appear. And probably all my settings that I don't want on my work laptop are synced, too.  </p><p>Is there a way to choose what to sync BEFORE the syncing starts?

To wit: </p><p>1) Certain sites have stopped loading properly. For instance until earlier today I could load Facebook with no problem, but now only the top blue menu bar will load; the rest of the page is blank white. Oftentimes this has happended with certain other sites; for instance I've not had full functionality on Vimeo or the New York Times' sites for a while. Until recently when I've had this issue with Facebook I've been able to clear the cache and re-load and that has been working, but today I tried this and now that solution doesn't work. </p><p>2) Certain buttons don't function, such as video playback buttons on The Guardian's site, or certain playback and navigation buttons on Netflix.  </p><p>3) I tired to log into my Firefox account and got the warning message ""Cookies and local storage are required. Please enable cookies and local storage in your browser to access Firefox Accounts. Doing so will enable functionality such as remembering you between sessions."" Cookies *are* enabled, however, and nothing seems to turn them back on. I've even tried trashing the cookies.sqlite file and re-starting, it doesn't help. </p><p>I'm tempted to trash the whole install and start from scratch (I've been upgrading from one to the next for over ten years now), but I have thousands of bookmarks I want to preserve, plus many passwords, and now I cannot even log into my Firefox account on the  browser itself due to the erroneous ""cookies"" error massage to confirm that all my passwords are safely backed up. I've tried re-starting in safe mode with all plug-in disabled, and that did nothing to solve my problems. </p><p>Er... help?! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1261244;1261306;1261308;1261343;1261344;1261347;1261353;1261354;1261355;1261357;1261364;1267537;1298259;,airstreamdriver,"id:1298259,created:2020-03-17 07:50:57 -0800,updated:2020-03-17 07:53:54 -0800,creator:dncoccupy,updated_by:,is_spam:true,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>WAS THIS HELPFUL ?

I looked at how to remove that and it doesn't show in extensions, so for now I have uninstalled Firefox, along with all the extra hidden data and registry enteries, installed an older version and dissabled updates.

I'd guess 6+ seconds?  The loading icon on the tab will move, but there is no network activity indicated at the bottom of the window nor in the Network Monitor (ctrl+shift+e) until after a few seconds.  Once this delay period has passed, all pages load as normal.  It does this every time, without fail, even in safe mode.  I am using the 64-bit version but also had a 32-bit version still installed, so I decided to launch that version instead, since it still uses my profile and so everything should otherwise be the same.  This version did not have the delay.  I was able to load a webpage immediately.  I have deleted this 32-bit version, thinking it may be interfering somehow (perhaps because using the same profile? idk), but it changed nothing.  I can't imagine how the 64-bit version would perform worse than the 32-bit, so I don't just assume switch over.  I'd like to continue with the 64-bit version, as I have sufficient RAM to make use of it.  I've tried a good handful of solutions, but nothing.  Any ideas?

It's not in Logins & Passwords,<p>Firefox explains how to save a login/password but doesn't tell you what to do if you accidentally decline that feature when it asks.  Every time I go to my online intuit account I have to manually enter the log in info because I accidentally declined to have Firefox save the login info when it asked me.  I looked in Firefox Preferences&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Logins and Passwords and finally in Exceptions &amp; Logins.  It's not in either of those places.  It shows logins that I DO have but it doesn't tell me how to add logins for websites that I declined saving them in the past.  When I go to the website Firefox won't ask me anymore if I want to save the login... AAHH!

Try it after each action to see whether it is available yet. </p><p>(1) Large alert dialog (lots of text) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, it may reappear. After two or three appearances, Firefox should add a checkbox at the bottom of the dialog to stop the site from showing more alerts. Check that box and click OK to block further dialogs. </p><p>(2) Authentication dialog (asks for username and password) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, the page may reload and immediately show it again. Pressing the Esc key numerous times in a row can cancel the reload as well as the dialog. </p><p>(3) Reacting to mouse movement </p><p>Some pages have a script that detects when you are moving the mouse pointer up toward the tab bar and takes action to show another dialog, or moves to full screen view to hide the toolbar area. On these pages, the keyboard shortcut is essential. </p><p>Hopefully this will let you close problem pages without having to ""kill"" Firefox in the Windows Task Manager. (I don't recommend using that method because the tab will come back during automatic crash recovery anyway.) </p> <hr> <p>Often these scam pages are promoted through ad networks. As a defensive measure, you could consider using an add-on that is effective at blocking ads, such as: </p><p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/</a> </p><p>As with any content blocker, this will cause problems on some sites, so keep an eye on its toolbar button in case you need to make an exception to get a page to load properly. </p> id:1262133,created:2019-10-28 22:28:36 -0800,updated:2019-10-28 22:28:36 -0800,creator:jagman55,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Sorry, I just TESTED that and it did work.

To add that button, either: </p><p>(A) Use the Customize panel (<a href=""/en-US/kb/customize-firefox-controls-buttons-and-toolbars"" rel=""nofollow"">Customize Firefox controls, buttons and toolbars</a>) to drag the icon to the desired spot on the toolbar </p><p>(B) Use the method from <a href=""/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">Bookmarks in Firefox</a> - section entitled: <em>How do I add the Bookmarks Menu button to the toolbar?</em> </p> <ul><li> Click the ""Library"" button: <img src=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/gallery/images/2017-10-11-11-30-17-d521f7.png""> </li><li> Click ""Bookmarks"" </li><li> Click ""Bookmarking Tools"" </li><li> Click ""Add Bookmarks Menu to Toolbar"" </li></ul> <p>Hopefully that works better? </p>"

See Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop for more information about how Firefox protects you against tracking. </p><p>Content blocking is a collection of Firefox privacy features that protect you from threats and annoyances on the Web. The default includes protections against trackers that collect your browsing data across multiple websites and cryptominers. Firefox also offers protections against harmful scripts, such as malware that drains your battery. These privacy protections are mostly invisible; you’ll know they’re working when you see a shield icon on the left within your address bar. </p><p>In some cases, blocking this content makes pages load faster, but can affect the page's functionality. It’s easy to disable blocking on sites you trust. You can also customize your content blocking preferences to block more or fewer trackers. </p> id:1261632,created:2019-10-27 13:46:00 -0800,updated:2019-10-27 13:46:00 -0800,creator:Vitaliy1993,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Mozilla definitely should improve this thing - show ONLY blocked cookies in the list of blocked and ONLY allowed in the list of allowed, so as not to mislead users. </p> id:1261602,created:2019-10-27 10:43:37 -0800,updated:2019-10-27 10:43:37 -0800,creator:Vitaliy1993,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>My_Cheese_Is_Slippin' <a href=""#answer-1261278"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> They would be 1st party cookies and would break the site. </blockquote> <p>So why Firefox shows this cookies in the list of blocked if they not blocked? </p> id:1261282,created:2019-10-26 05:04:35 -0800,updated:2019-10-26 05:04:35 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>Vitaliy1993 <a href=""#answer-1261281"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Never had it before with previous Firefox 69. </blockquote> <p>You didn't have Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox 69 </p> id:1261281,created:2019-10-26 05:00:38 -0800,updated:2019-10-26 05:00:38 -0800,creator:Vitaliy1993,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>My_Cheese_Is_Slippin' <a href=""#answer-1261278"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> They would be 1st party cookies and would break the site. </blockquote> <p>So they shouldn't appear in bocking list.

We're seeing an issue where, when staff go to login to a particular website, their saved password is being autofilled with a randomly generated one. I had the staff go in to Firefox password management and delete the incorrect saved passwords. I had the staff member log back in to the site and enter their correct password to the website. They could log in, and Firefox would prompt the user if they wanted to save the password. But once again, the password that Firefox was prompting to save was a randomly-generated one and NOT the one the user just entered.  </p><p>Has anyone else seen this?

I then opened Google Chrome (see attached image), went to the same email in my Gmail client, and the feature worked.

I'll list below everything I have tried (not in any particular order): 1. Restart with add-ons disabled - this worked only once to solve my problem, now it doesn't 2. Refresh Firefox 3. Restart my laptop multiple times 4. Limited the number of tabs to see if it was a workload problem 5. Ran two scans on my SSD - came back normal both times 6. Took out and reinserted my SSD - it was having issues anyway... 7. Used Edge and Chrome with the same websites/workload - no issues 8. Uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox 9. Checked for updates - there are none 10. Removed DuckDuckGo extension - I thought it was an issue but I guess it wasn't 11. Started Firefox with only Gmail open - reference number 4 12. Seen if it happened on non-Google related webpages - we're in the clear there 13. Monitored Task Manager for any abnormal spiking - my cpu does anyways while I use it but it's never enough to hang Firefox, and I have enough RAM to cover it </p><p>I have NOT done any major Windows updates since May 2019 due to the numerous problems arising from them over the past year and my OS is not corrupted in any way...at least I hope...but it's a bit extreme to reinstall Windows just for this if that happens to be some sort of solution. </p><p>I don't really want to say it's directly a Google problem, as I've switched to Chrome to compensate for now and those websites have been running smoothly, along with temporary testing in Edge.

There's no option to remove it.,"<p>Windows 10 Pro, Version 1903, OS Build 18362.418 FF 70.0 (64 bit) </p><p>Let me preface this with saying I worked in IT for a long time. I'm stumped on this one. </p><p>FF worked fine on 10/22/19. Tried opening FF on 10/23/19 and it kept crashing. I started the task of finding out why.  </p><p>Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search. It wasn't there the last time I reviewed addons (which I do frequently, trying to find the best addon's for my usage) and I hadn't installed anything new recently. Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly. </p><p>I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it.  </p><p>It is not in the Control Panel.  It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder.   Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere. I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc.  It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF. </p><p>How do I get this removed?

I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves.  Any idea what could be causing this?

Does it take a genius to google out ""Firefox 72.0.1 changelog""? Prove me wrong, but I don't think so. In my opinion, a separate button for viewing the changelog is <strong>pointless</strong>. Have you ever seen any other application displaying a ""<em>What's New</em>"" button in its main toolbar?  </p><p>There's already a ""What's New"" link in the <em>About</em> dialog  and an item under the <em>Hamburger</em> button menu. I'd say that those two are enough for those who want to be informed. Additional toolbar button is too intrusive, especially when you struggle to get rid of it. </p> id:1279381,created:2020-01-08 12:56:14 -0800,updated:2020-01-08 12:56:14 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>@ bjm_1 : </p><p>There is a difference between a certain feature not working as expected <br>and not wanting that feature at all. </p><p>Of course it will be appreciated when people report it when a feature doesn't work   -   that will only be helpful.

Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs. </p><p>Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs. </p><p>In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response. </p><p>Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying. </p><p>Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session. </p><p>Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter. </p><p>Many Thanks. </p><p>P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark.

To be more specific, any tabs that were opened before the crash are gone, and any that were closed before the crash are back. So both windows are stuck at a specific number of tabs, I don't know why those tabs have been kept. </p><p>When Firefox does open, I find that I cannot use the task bar (anything typed in there is treated as nonexistent by the system, only a white bar extends rather than the average extensions or suggestions), and the options menu refuses to open fully, and when it does trying to access the menu that would keep any existing tabs from reopening upon restart had a blank area where the options were supposed to be. </p><p>It's asking me if I want to start in safe mode.

I don't know why. An alternate way to decompress the .jsonlz4 file to .json is to run a script in Firefox's Browser Console that uses Firefox's built-in decompression function. The script for that can be found here: </p><p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/jscher2000/4403507e33df0918289619edb83f8193"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jscher2000/4403507e33df0918289619edb83f8193</a> </p><p>(It places the decompressed file in the same folder as the compressed file you tell it to use.) </p><p>Alternately, do you have Google Chrome or Opera?

It did install Sticky Password but in doing so I had to close all the windows. Then it proceeded to install Firefox in an older version, V - 9.0, with most of my existing extensions missing.

It started with an update of Foxfire which did the same trick, updated Firefox and then reinstalled Sticky Password and reverted back to to Version 69.0 - with the extensions missing. Both times, if I click on the taskbar Firefox icon, the new version comes up with the same problem, app enabled but greyed out. This time, when V-69 was there, it had a note to update Firefox which did nothing. I assume that it saw that V. 70.0 was already there and running and went back to sleep.

I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that.  </p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll.  </p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser.  </p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error! </p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help. </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;windows-10;firefox-700;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1260497;1260692;1260861;1260962;1263086;1263139;,lgfuad,"id:1263139,created:2019-11-01 10:53:32 -0800,updated:2019-11-01 10:53:32 -0800,creator:akilas765,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release</a> </p><p>use this link and download the version that you want </p> id:1263086,created:2019-11-01 06:56:01 -0800,updated:2019-11-01 06:56:01 -0800,creator:lgfuad,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>No, I tried all that.

With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning.  </p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again? </p><p>I am using firefox 68.0. I upgraded from firefox 57.0 over this past summer, and I did not have this issue with top hat and location services prior to upgrading. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-680;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1260422;1260433;1260436;,corsair1944,"id:1260436,created:2019-10-23 14:10:21 -0800,updated:2019-10-23 14:10:21 -0800,creator:corsair1944,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1260433"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Did you try to clear cache and cookies from this website or possibly use ""Clear history when Firefox closes"" to clear the cache let the cookies expire automatically (Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed)?

This generally works very well. </p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.  I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles. </p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem. </p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good. </p><p>I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway. </p><p>Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Charles </p>",linux;desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;firefox-710;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1260368;1260381;,charlesc-firefox.com,"id:1260381,created:2019-10-23 11:49:32 -0800,updated:2019-10-23 11:49:32 -0800,creator:charlesc-firefox.com,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>&gt; And if a Profile was already running when the update was installed, the  &gt; update would ""show"" itself in the Profile after the next launch of that  &gt; Profile.  </p><p>Yes, once you restart the Firefox instances running with one of the ""secondary"" profiles, the ""new version is available"" notification stops.  The problem is in the interim, after installing the update (in the main profile) and before restarting the secondary Firefox instances.  I can't just restart those on a whim; I have important state in them and may need to wait several days before I can do so. </p><p>In these days, there is the constant danger that I will accidentally accept an update in one of the secondary instances, which hoses the Firefox installation and requires a manual reinstall. </p><p>Charles </p> id:1260368,created:2019-10-23 11:15:43 -0800,updated:2019-10-23 11:15:43 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Firefox updates get installed in the Program Files folder,  so when one Profile receives a Firefox program update all the other Profiles using that Firefox program installation are ""updated"", too.

And if a Profile was already running when the update was installed, the update would ""show"" itself in the Profile after the next launch of that Profile.  </p><p>The confusing situation now is that before Firefox 67 when ""the enterprise policy method"" came about the user preference for ""never check for updates"" was in the Profile - (IOW, each individual Profile needed that pref set);  just one Profile where the user didn't have that pref set would trigger the update installation to the Program files folder. </p><p>Now ""the enterprise policy method"" is global, the individual Profiles have no influence. </p><p>Short of multiple different Firefox installations I can't think of a ""solution"", in fact there have been times that I have had multiple installations of the same version of Firefox installed just to get around my forgetting to disable automatic updates in one new Profile and having a batch of Profiles that I didn't want to be updated. <em>Keep in mind that the bulk of Firefox data on the drive is in the Profile; the Firefox program files are a small percentage of what Firefox needs or uses to work.

The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly. </p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary. </p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin. </p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.

To them, it's just the browser they use to surf the Net, and most of them won't even speak up when a change inconveniences them ... if it bothers them enough, they will seek an alternative.  That follows the same thought process about the website owners being responsible but the browser being blamed. </p><p>What will the website developers do when Flash is not supported by any browser, as indeed will be the case in a little over a year?  Hopefully they will act before then, but if not then there is no one left to blame. </p><p>However, that is still more than a year off.  My suggestion is still more secure and more protective of users than was the previous setting that allowed Flash to be automatically allowed anywhere that had Flash.  It is not intended to be anything but an interim user convenience, activated only on a domain-by-domain basis by the users, and it would obsolete itself at the end of next year. </p><p>I believe it to be a balance between user-friendliness and the need for security.  I refuse to accept any answer that implies that the balance has to unequivocally be tilted entirely away from the former due to the need for the latter. </p> id:1260530,created:2019-10-23 18:29:17 -0800,updated:2019-10-23 18:29:17 -0800,creator:travis3,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Blocking Flash and forcing the user to acknowledge their decision to take on the risk of using Flash is in line with a policy of security and privacy. In my opinion, this kind of thing is why users of Firefox choose this browser. It is possible for a user to enable Flash, but it is equally likely that a malicious actor would take advantage of that security risk. </p><p>On the other hand, not allowing a user to customize their own experience does come off as user-unfriendly. However, I can't imagine that the purpose of the change to disallow Flash was a conspiracy to force web developers into submission since every browser is eventually going to go the same route. The developers of Firefox are pioneers of security and privacy in this regard. </p><p>If the website were to exploit Flash to cause harm to a user's computer, who would the user blame? Hopefully, it's the website creator, but if the browser is providing the website creator with the ability to exploit in the first place, then the browser developer has not done their due diligence to protect the user. All the risk of a malicious actor exploiting Flash is on Firefox. The web browser must be able to deliver content in a standards-based, reliable fashion, but cannot compromise the security of its users in the process. </p><p>Perhaps the developers of Firefox are not the ones worthy of this complaint, but rather the developers of the websites that choose to expose their users to insecure technology.

I changed my primary email address at a time, when Firefox Sync did not support changing email addresses. I now checked to see if changing email addresses was possible and indeed, you can now add a secondary email address and switch it to be the primary one. So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"". I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible. </p><p>Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address? </p><p>If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to.

1271005,2019-10-20 20:23:38 -0800,2019-10-24T18:03:49Z,Problema de flickering en el escritorio de Windows 10 con Firefox,"<p>Hola Firefox 69 (también ocurre lo mismo con Chrome) genera un problema en el escritorio de Windows 10, y el problema es que se genera un flickering parpadeo muy molesto. Este parpadeo es un error bien conocido, y ya está documentado en Youtube. El parpadeo ocurre solamente en el escritorio de Windows 10 y no se presenta en las ventanas de otras aplicaciones, afecta solo al escritorio. Es un parpadeo que muestra cuadrados con bloques que parpadean constantamente, pero siempre, en el escritorio de Windows 10 y no en las ventanas de otras aplicaciones. Este parpadeo ocurre cuando se está usando Firefox y se producen ventanas emergentes, al ocurrir esto, se empieza a producir el parpadeo. No es un defecto de drivers, ya que si así fuera ocurriría en toda la pantalla y con todas las aplicaciones, y no solo en el escritorio de Windows 10. Deshabilitar la aceleración por Hardware no soluciona el problema. Este problema se produce cuando se utiliza Firefox y cuando salen ventanas emergentes, pero, cuando Windows 10 está configurado en modo PRESENTACIÓN (es decir, para que el fondo de pantalla de Windows cambie automáticamente a otro nuevo, cada X minutos). Si Windows 10 está configurado en modo Imagen, para que ponga una imagen fija en el escritorio como fondo de pantalla, entonces el flickering no se presenta al usar Firefox. Desactivar el modo PRESENTACIÓN es lo único que resuelve el problema, pero con la limitación de tenerte que aguantar con el mismo fondo de pantalla sin que Windows lo cambie. El problema no se presenta porque sea algo de Windows, el problema se presenta si se usa Firefox y Windows está configurado para cambiar el fondo de pantalla con el modo presentación. Si uso Edge y tengo configurado Windows 10 en modo presentación, entonces los fondos de pantalla cambian y no pasa nada, incluso si salen ventanas emergentes. ¿Cuando podrá solucionarse este problema tan molesto? Lo raro es que pasa con Firefox y con Chrome, pero no pasa con Edge de Microsoft. ¿Alguien sabe por qué pasa y como solucionarlo permitiendo que Windows me pueda cambiar los fondos de pantalla?

Reopening the regular window via the 4 ways you described works without problems (as long as the window is in the list), but opening a new window doesn't pick up the recently closed window as it would if the private window were not present. </blockquote> <p>Hmm, it sounds as though Firefox is still running (at least one window open). So launching a new window through the Taskbar Jump List simply adds a window to the same session rather than starting a new session.

Just make sure you don't leave any line gaps or string two lines of prefs together.  Then with Firefox running go into <strong>about:config</strong> and ""set"" the preference <strong>value</strong> there. But you have to make sure the edited file saves as a <strong>prefs.js</strong> file and not as a <strong>prefs.js.txt</strong> file as some users have had happen when using a text editor. If that happens Firefox will just ignore that file and create a new <em><strong>prefs.js</strong></em>  as part of the launch routine. </p> id:1259715,created:2019-10-20 01:10:58 -0800,updated:2019-10-20 01:10:58 -0800,creator:rjvbertin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>(wow, the ""post a reply button"" was well hidden in the notification email!) </p><p>I may not have made it very clear, but I did change the device name via `about:preferences?entrypoint=fxa_app_menu#sync`.

Presuming the reconnection is automatic when you force a sync from the disconnected device? </p><p>Other than that, is there anything else I can try? `prefs.js` is a JavaScript and thus text file, so if ""something in there"" is the culprit it might be possible to change it? </p><p>FWIW, I did *not* lose my extension setting, as far as I can tell, but I *may* have copied the contents of the cache directory too. </p> id:1259701,created:2019-10-20 00:07:13 -0800,updated:2019-10-20 00:07:13 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>As far as fixing that issue on the ""cloned"" Profile, I concur with Fred so far as changing the Device Name - - but only using <strong>about:preferences#sync</strong> &gt;  ""Changed Device Name"" to see if that fixes it.  That worked for me on a Win7 computer a 4 or 5 years ago, <em>after I 'cloned' a Profile which was using Sync and I wanted 'copy' of that Profile so I could use Sync to synchronize 2 Profiles on the same device in different Logon User Accounts. Part of the process to start using a new computer; a process that failed as far as extensions losing all their settings and data - as explained further along in my posting</em>. </p> <hr> <p>Sync doesn't go by the unique 'hashed' Profile identification as used in the Profile Manager, and as seen in the Profiles folder and the profiles.ini file.  Sync on the browser connects to the Sync server thru the Profile which is running; the prefs don't 'go thru' the Profile Manager or use the ""Profiles"" part of Firefox. The Profile Manager system has been around since Firefox 0.9 in 2004; whereas Sync came about with Firefox 4.0 in 2010. </p> <hr> <p>IMO, this KB article has a few errors or faults - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles#w_restoring-a-profile-backup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles#w_restoring-a-profile-backup</a> -  </p><p>In <strong>about:config</strong> this preference <em><strong>services.sync.client.syncID;jtFSgWJyJeE7</strong></em> is used to identify each Profile with the Sync System, and maybe with the Firefox Accounts (FxA) system too. </p><p>That said,  <em><strong><a href=""http://services.sync.client.name"" rel=""nofollow"">services.sync.client.name</a>;Firefox using Quantum</strong></em>  is the 'label' used in the Sync <strong>Device Name</strong> field in Sync &gt; Preferences -&gt; Device Name. </p><p>IMO, what's happening is that copying the <strong>prefs.js</strong> file put you in the situation where two Firefox Profiles are labeled as the same Profile / installation to the Sync server, and maybe with the Firefox Accounts (FxA) log on system.   </p> <hr> <p>In <strong>about:config</strong> there is a column labeled <strong>Status</strong> with a value of either <strong>default</strong> or <strong>modified</strong>.  The <strong>modified</strong> prefs get written to the <strong>prefs.js</strong> file.  <em>Actually it's a 2-way exchange; if you edit prefs.js file the edit will appear in about:config after a Firefox launch. And prefs.js editing needs Firefox to not be running.</em> So basically, the <strong>prefs.js</strong> file contains the preferences that are not the ""default"" prefs from the original installation of Firefox. </p><p>The <strong>prefs.js</strong> file contains <em>(only)</em> preferences that have changed from the 'default' values, either manually thru the <strong>about:config</strong> panel by the user, or thru the Preferences / Options UI.  Also, installation of extensions may add about:config prefs </p><p>IMO, the <strong>prefs.js</strong> file should not be ""cloned"" or you may run into a variety of issues. There has been at least one other KB article that states that <strong>prefs.js</strong> shouldn't be copied over when transferring Profile data to a new or different Profile; that includes 'cloning' a Profile. </p><p>Not so bad in Mac OSX or Linux OS's, but on Windows that can be a real 'can of worms'; although with prefs for extensions the new Quantum versions have greatly lessened the complications by providing alternative storage files for extensions prefs -- available for extension developers to use as an alternative to the <strong>prefs.js</strong> file. </p> id:1259689,created:2019-10-19 19:08:33 -0800,updated:2019-10-19 19:08:33 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>With the current versions, try this; </p><p>Right click on the 'hamburger' icon at the far right on the toolbar.

Hovering the mouse cursor over that search field or bar will turn it from purple to white, clearly showing it as ""blank"" (no Google logo inside) and, as written above, the same search field cannot be used because ""unclickable"". My default search engine (just Google) will look like ""not loaded"" in that search field or bar (as written, no logo displayed in). Instead, if I write something (a keyword, a search term or an address) in the Firefox Address bar, even without closing, changing or refreshing that same firefox window, everything will be OK and Google will search it for me as usual: the problem is ONLY related to that search field (or ""bar"") placed in the middle of the purple start page of Firefox in ""private browsing"" mode. </p><p>Please note: this problem NEVER occurs if ANY Firefox window in ANY mode (private or ""regular"") is ALREADY opened/started. I mean, if I start ""private browsing"" from the Firefox's jump list in the Windows task bar and there is NO instance of Firefox ALREADY running (I mean: no other Firefox window already opened), the problem occurs about 7-8 times out of 10, as written above. Otherwise, if Firefox is ALREADY running, I mean there is at least a Firefox window ALREADY opened, no matter in what mode (private mode or the ""regular"" one...), opening a new window in private mode will NEVER result in a ""faulty"" search bar/field in the middle of the usual ""purple start page"".  </p><p>It seems like the default search engine (for my Firefox: Google) has not enough time to be loaded, if I start a private window ""from scratch"". Instead, if there is any Firefox window already opened (i.e.: Firefos is already ""started""), no problem will occur. By the way, I have tested my very same Firefox configuration duplicated on a virtual machine of mine and the problem NEVER occurs in ANY case because, I guess, that virtual machine runs veeery slowly and its virtualized Firefox takes A LOT to start and load (my host computer is too old and slow for virtualization).  </p><p>Below, some screenshots.

When I go through the usual means, it's not there except the shit that is the original Edge and the joke which is Internet Explorer. I don't get chrome as an option as I don't use it, since Google is crap. Is there any way that I can do it, by importing files myself (and if so, which ones) or something? If there's no way to do it, at least I hope the Mozilla team see this to implement it, I doubt it's hard but I don't know. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-680;,firefox,other,en-US,1259541;1259600;,xdmrawesomexd,"id:1259600,created:2019-10-19 04:33:06 -0800,updated:2019-10-19 04:33:06 -0800,creator:xdmrawesomexd,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>So I had a look and the JSON files I could find by search is some manifest JSON files in a few random folders but nothing seemed to be linked to the profile.

There is another folder outside of this main one but it has nothing of substance, just has the executable files and another folder with setup files. I also couldn't get chrome to import from ms edge dev, even with basic edge all it does is import favourites/bookmarks so I couldn't get that to work either. </p> id:1259541,created:2019-10-18 17:36:35 -0800,updated:2019-10-18 17:36:35 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>What does the content of the profile folder used by this Edge Dev version look like?

W10 cannot be changed Chrome is OK,<p>TThe problem is there is a very low contrast between the rectangular elevetor and the task bar. It is very difficult to see. And there is no way to change the color of the elevator (in vertical task bars) in w10. Chrome is OK. it is  very clear  with this browser. So I suppose  Firefox could do an upgrade .  I am not the only one annoyed with this problem.  And I am sorry to say to you that until this problem is  fixed I will read my mail  with Chrome.

Changing the height of the broken element through the Inspect Element tool after the page has loaded fixes the maximum dif height issue.

It was renamed in 2017 to Quantum after completely overhauling the engine with many performance improvements while introducing <a href=""https://blog.getpocket.com/2017/11/introducing-pocket-recommendations-in-firefox-quantum/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pocket</a> integration. <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox Quantum</a>  </p><p><strong>Firefox Nightly</strong> is an alternative if you would like to participate and test bugs.  This version features the latest features in development, allowing you to get a sneak peak before they are available to Firefox Quantum.  You will commonly see updates to this browser daily and this will require frequent restarts. <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox Nightly</a>  </p><p><strong>Firefox Beta</strong> was designed to be a browser that has already been tested yet still prone to bugs so it is still meant for testing, with the difference being with the general public.  <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/"" rel=""nofollow"">Beta</a>  </p><p><strong>Firefox Developer Edition</strong> is designed for people who are interested in web development and offer the tools that you need to build for the open web.   <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox Browser Developer Edition</a>  </p><p><strong>Firefox</strong> <strong>Extended Support Release</strong> (ESR) was designed for workplace environments that need to set up and maintain Firefox on a larger scale.  This version is intended for system administration for these purposes. </p><p>I personally use Firefox Quantum and Nightly.  What's great about Nightly is that it offers some features that are not released to Firefox Quantum.  The only drawback I have is that it updates frequently, however that is also how the web-browser was specifically designed.  But it all depends on what you want to do to decide which version works best for your needs. </p><p>Getting started with Firefox: <a href=""/en-US/kb/get-started-firefox-overview-main-features"" rel=""nofollow"">Get started with Firefox </a> </p>"

And you also don't understand the difference between Nightly and Web Developer / Beta (which is now Fx 70); my reasoning for saying that is that the Nightly builds are where changes such as that first appear and those changes sometimes happen more frequently as the changes are being tested. Sometimes the changes are inadvertently broken and need to be fixed with a later version; part of the testing process.

It starts up OK but is very slow to open the first page on a website, often over a minute. Once the first page opens however it will open links perfectly OK. It doesn't matter whether it's a bookmark I visit often or the first time I visit s website it's still very slow to open the first page. </p><pre>I've tried everything I know (several times); I've uninstalled &amp; re-installed Firefox, created a new profile, loaded in Safe Mode, removed all add-ons and re-installed them one by one and refreshed Firefox. Each method corrects it initially so I leave it a while then re-install each add-on in turn. I let it run for a day or so with each add-on and each time it runs fine. Until I get all add-ons re-installed! It always runs OK for a day or two (or sometimes longer) then it suddenly slows down again and will remain slow until I do one of the above again. </pre> <p>I'm running the latest version of Windows 10 and Firefox Quantum and I've also disabled the antimalware in Windows Defender but that's made no difference.

Open Start Menu and click on Settings option. It'll open Settings app. Alternatively, you can direct open Settings app using WIN+I hotkey. </p><p>2.

Let that Sync connection proceed for quite awhile, and restart Firefox a few times to allow for a ""launch"" connection with the Sync server. <em>Be aware that Sync may work in ""spurts"" of activity at times when ""your Sync server location"" is loaded </em>and if the user is re-arranging bookmarks it will switch to a ""batch mode""<em> {disconnect from Sync if you are going to move more than just a few bookmarks.}</em>.   Sync is fast, but it's not 'fast' like when downloading data or application files from a download server. The Sync server is more complicated with more 2-way exchanges of data, especially when your Sync account is empty or when new devices are first connected. </p><p>B. Check that the 'multiple copies of bookmarks' hasn't happened again before connecting 2nd and subsequent devices. Catch the ""faults"" as soon as they happen. </p><p>C. Delay connecting that iOS 13 device to make sure the base issue is corrected. I can't ""test"" Firefox for 'mobile' and don't trust Sync on 'mobile' based upon the continuing number of issues that I see here. Yes, a lot better than 3 years ago and Sync use is a lot greater in the last 1 1/2 years, or so; but my trust hasn't been restored - as a ""by-stander"" who just bought their first smart phone. </p><p>Hopefully you will get that 'duplicates' issue solved. </p> id:1259878,created:2019-10-21 03:21:42 -0800,updated:2019-10-21 03:21:42 -0800,creator:maurizio.mwg,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello, </p><p>i have tried disabling sync on my iPhone iOS 13, i have waited a couple of days, but then when i have accessed Firefox on my Windows 10 laptop (and then as well on my mac book) the same problem  with duplicated bookmarks occurred. </p><p>If this means that my original backup file is corrupted, is there anything i can do to fix it?

It is like the browser has never heard of that site before, nor the login information saved??  This is frustrating because there is no way for me to check on the json file that contains the saved logins, that I can find. I have been told that the json file may have been changed to json.corrupt., and I should find it, and rename it back to the original, but this is something I cannot find anywhere.

I just want the code writers of Firefox to be cognizant of the real world use of it's browser - yes, there are many like me, still using Firefox on a laptop or desktop that is not a touchscreen.    (Otherwise I don't get why they think tabs on top is efficient) </p><p>Thank You for letting me say my piece. This has been very frustrating today! </p><p>Cheers! </p>"

Hace meses que al intentar pagar algo a través de Webpay me arroja una página en blanco al llegar a la url: ""<a href=""https://webpay3g.transbank.cl/webpayserver/bp_control.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webpay3g.transbank.cl/webpayserver/bp_control.cgi</a>"". Luego de esta url, debería derivarme a mi página de banco, pero se queda en blanco, sin avanzar. En otras palabras, acepto pagar con Webpay, me deriva a su portal en donde coloco mi rut y elijo un banco y al avanzar hacia la página de mi banco, se queda en una pantalla en blanco, con la url que mencioné. Si intento refrescar la página, me arroja error en la transacción. Esto es algo que hace unos meses viene ocurriendo, ya que antiguamente no sucedía. Sé que hubo otro tema creado al respecto en este foro, pero no se le dio solución. Intenté también las soluciones propuestas (desactivar extensiones, borrar cookies, desactivar rastreadores y otras opciones de seguridad, absolutamente todo, incluso instalar una extensión que ""finge"" ser otro navegador). En cambio, en Google Chrome o Edge la página no tiene problema alguno y puedo hacer pagos tranquilamente. </p><p>¿Alguna idea? Agradecería orientación o si se ha logrado llegar a alguna solución, ya que Firefox sigue siendo mi navegador de preferencia y es una verdadera molestia tener que cambiar de navegador cada vez que debo pagar algo, y peor aún, recordarlo en mitad del pago, lo que ha causado en ocasiones que las páginas de productos consideren ""hecha la compra"" y su inventario quede sin stock, de manera artificial. ¡Gracias! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-690;,firefox,websites,es,1258859;1258892;1259033;1259070;1259823;,Lindaravstar,"id:1259823,created:2019-10-20 15:35:30 -0800,updated:2019-10-20 15:35:30 -0800,creator:pcp04,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hola, Podrías probar, bajo tu responsabilidad, habilitar nuevamente el cifrado RC4, modificando o agregando la siguiente cadena en la configuración del Firefox: security.tls.unrestricted_rc4_fallback  a ""true"" -Escribir en la barra de direcciones: about:config, aceptar las advertencias, escribir la siguiente cadena en el campo de búsqueda: security.tls.unrestricted_rc4_fallback, si no existe con el botón derecho del mouse agregar: Nuevo-&gt;Logico, escribir ""security.tls.unrestricted_rc4_fallback"" (sin las comillas), finalmente elejir ""true"" </p><p>Pero no se si aun tiene efecto este cambio porque el cifrado RC4 esta desactivado en el Firefox desde el 2016 y desde fines del 2017 el Firefox tuvo grandes cambios: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/09/11/deprecating-the-rc4-cipher/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/09/11/deprecating-the-rc4-cipher/</a> Saludos </p> id:1259070,created:2019-10-16 09:04:04 -0800,updated:2019-10-16 09:04:04 -0800,creator:Lindaravstar,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Lo comprendo, pero impide realizar pagos, lo que, insisto, es sumamente frustrante y engorroso cuando estoy en mitad del proceso y recuerdo súbitamente que estoy en Firefox (que sigue siendo mi navegador de preferencia, como lo ha sido por años), trabando la transacción con todas las consecuencias que eso tiene. ¿No existe algún modo de desactivar alguna configuración de seguridad de Firefox, a mi propio riesgo, para facilitar el proceso? ¿O simplemente tengo que aguantar esta falla y esperar a que la empresa de Webpay algún día espabile (lo que dudo, considerando que funciona perfecto en Chrome?  </p><p>Agradezco todas las respuestas :) </p> id:1259033,created:2019-10-16 05:08:16 -0800,updated:2019-10-16 05:08:16 -0800,creator:pcp04,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hola, Los otros navegadores ignoran el problema del sitio, prefieren mostrar igualmente el sitio a la seguridad del usuario, Firefox no funciona de esa forma: <a href=""https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=webpay3g.transbank.cl#httpRequests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=webpay3g.transbank.cl#httpRequests</a> En el anterior enlace podrás ver donde dice rc4 la indicación de ""inseguro"" Saludos </p> id:1258892,created:2019-10-15 11:34:29 -0800,updated:2019-10-15 11:34:29 -0800,creator:Lindaravstar,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Gracias por responder.

I'm running into a problem with Firefox that I've not encountered in many years of use, namely that after about 5 or 6 hours of uptime, any open Firefox tab that I refresh or any new one I create gets stuck showing the ""TLS handshake"" note in the lower left and then times out with a message that the server being contacted is not responding.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem but rebooting the Mac does, in that Firefox reaches any site once again.  But then after another 5-6 hours the problem crops up once more.  All other software continues to run just fine during these TLS handshake problems, such as Outlook, Mail, Sonos, etc.  I did not encounter this problem when running Firefox on this machine with Mojave.  Because I'd rather not have to reboot every several hours I'm wondering if anyone has run into this and/or can suggest a fix for this.  Is there a special setting to change or update in Catalina (the only variable I'm aware of that's changed since my upgrade) or in Firefox to work with Catalina's many new settings?

There are plenty of add-ons to group tabs. But all of them end up hiding/unhiding the tabs of only the current window. </p><p>It looks that the underlying architecture is this: OS has Firefox. Firefox has Windows. Windows have tabs. Tabs are manageable only in the window they belong to. </p><p>Therefore, every window is only aware of its own group of tabs. </p><p>What I am looking for is a different approach, or at least the illusion of it: OS has Firefox Firefox has Tabs. Tabs are manageable, from any instance of a window. </p><p>Therefore, the window is only a viewer that is aware of all the tabs. </p><p>The plug-ins:  Panorama Tab Group, Simple Tab Groups, and similar work a bit, but if I open a new window, and do some browsing, the old window does not know anything in the new window. </p><p>Is there a setting/plugin that can solve this problem? maybe I am missing some setting or I just don't know how to use the plugins...

To check on that: </p> <ul><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it </li></ul> <p>In the left column, click Home.

Any extensions Firefox installs for built-in features are hidden from this page, so everything listed here is your choice (and your responsibility) to manage. Anything that mentions Yahoo, or mentions search, or looks suspicious or that you just do not remember installing or why? If in doubt, disable (or remove). </p><p>Any improvement? </p>"

Do you run uBlock Origin or NoScript, for example? In uBlock Origin, the setting is called ""Block remote fonts"". </p><p>There's also a general setting to block downloadable fonts in about:config, if you think you might ever have changed that: </p><p>(1) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful or accepting the risk. </p><p>(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste <strong>gfx.down</strong> and pause while the list is filtered </p><p>(3) If the <strong>gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled</strong> preference is bolded and ""modified"" or ""user set"" to false, double-click it to restore the default value of true </p><p>Was it any of those things? </p>"

So many settings from the past don't work or aren't even there anymore.  Why are these pages not updated?  Who even uses old version of this browser?  99% of the info online is irrelevant because of this sloppiness.  Just go to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a> and see if anything works.  Good luck with that.   I did find one extension that did work (so far):  Disable HTML5 Autoplay But we shouldn't need an extension to do something so basic, so intrinsic to web browsing.  We all know distractions impeded our ability to get things done and cost billions every day as people's productivity sharply drops.  There is nothing more distracting than a video!  So its the number one thing to control.  As long as you're over about 4 years old of course.  Under that and we're fascinated by unfamiliar shiny objects.   </p><p>So I'm curious about all the autoplay options I have in about:config and if any of these settings matter anymore, now that I have an extension that does what Firefox seems incapable of doing.  When I search for autoplay, this is what I get, sorted alphabetically.  I noticed that some are in bold.  Why is that?  And why is Mozilla so out of touch with us that they can't explain what each of these things actually does?  I wonder if they even know.  You should be able to hover your mouse cursor over an item and a popup should tell you what it does.  Is that so difficult?  Guess so.   </p><p>true    dom.media.autoplay.autoplay-policy-api               true    extensions.webextensions.ExtensionStorageIDB.migrated.disable-html5-autoplay@afnankhan false   media.autoplay.allow-extension-background-pages true    media.autoplay.block-event.enabled true   media.autoplay.block-webaudio 1        media.autoplay.default false  media.autoplay.enabled.user-gestures-needed true   media.block-autoplay-until-in-foreground false  services.sync.prefs.sync.media.autoplay.default </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-690;,firefox,customize,en-US,1257779;1257785;1257808;1257809;1257821;1258029;1258045;1258047;1258082;1264083;1295207;1302286;1303193;1303200;,moz2u,"id:1303200,created:2020-04-06 19:06:43 -0800,updated:2020-04-06 19:06:43 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi tomaddox </p><p>What operating system are you running ? </p><p>Do you get the auto-play icon in the location/address bar that Firefox would show normally ? </p><p>You can create a new profile as a quick test to see if your current profile is causing the problem. </p><p>See ""Creating a profile"": </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles</a> </li></ul> <p>If the new profile works then you can transfer files from a previously used profile to the new profile, but be cautious not to copy corrupted files to avoid carrying over problems. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile</a> </li></ul> id:1303193,created:2020-04-06 18:19:49 -0800,updated:2020-04-06 18:19:49 -0800,creator:tomaddox,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Ironically, I've now gone so far in the other direction that Firefox resolutely refuses to play pretty much any embedded video.

We have multiple clients connecting thru a corporate VPN and they are having issues with Firefox: When they try to access a website they are experiencing a timeout with “Performing a TLS Handshake to…”.  This only happens on the initial launch of Firefox. A refresh (F5) or reload immediately opens the website after the timeout. As long as the browser stays open, they do not have anymore issues accessing websites. If the browser is closed and re-opened, the issue reappears for the first website requested. This happens for every user connected via VPN.  No issues whatsoever when they are directly connected to the network (office). After some troubleshooting, I noticed that the issue appeared from version 67.0. All previous versions do not have the TLS Handshake issue. We are currently using Version 69.0.1. Redoing profiles did not resolve the issue. VPN Users that are having the issue are on Windows 10 while Windows 7 users do not the problem. Also of note, if the client opens Firefox and leaves it idling for 40 sec. (or more) before requesting a https website, they do not get a TLS Handshake timeout. No issues in IE11, Edge or Chrome while connected thru VPN. </p><p>Ideas? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-690;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",redguy74,""

With help from Apple Services I succeeded in this as far as it concerns computer A.  Once passwords have been saved at computer A, computer A reminds and recognizes these passwords, even after closing down the computer. And that's exactly the way it should be.  </p><p>Computer B however: I failed to succeed.

Hello, after <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/</a> got an update and it uses the Highwind Player for the videos, the arrow keys don't work. By pressing left or right arrow key, the video doesn't move 5 seconds back or forward, however, pressing ""J"" and ""L"" does move the video back and forward (""K"" pauses/plays the video), pressing up or down doesn't change the volume. Starting Firefox in private browsing or using Edge however, the arrow keys work normally, rewinding or forwarding the video and increasing/decreasing sound. The contrary is also true, J,K,L only work with normal Frefox, but don't do anything on private browser or other borwsers. My question is, since the private browsing is still using the standard player, is there any way I can force the standard Firefox to use the normal player instead of the Highwind Player?

You're not using <strong>iCloud</strong> for bookmarks sync with Firefox, are you? How about an add-on for Firefox that interfaces with Safari sync? <em>Unless you have some sort of add-on installed for Firefox or an external application that ""connects"" Firefox bookmarks with something outside the Mozilla realm I can't see how ""ALL"" bookmarks would be affected.</em> Another thing comes to mind; you're not importing bookmarks into Firefox from Safari - are you? <em>That will append any bookmarks that already exist in Firefox.

Still having multiple duplicated bookmarks on all devices. </blockquote> <p>So, if you're dealing with just 2 desktop / laptop Firefox installations, your problem is probably that the bookmarksbackup is most likely corrupted.  When the places.sqlite file is removed, the most recent bookmarksbackup JSON <em>(or JSONLZ4 file)</em>  file will be used to populate the new places.sqlite file when Firefox is launched.  In that case you need an older backup that hasn't suffered duplicates yet.  </p><p>By default Firefox automatically saves 15 bookmarksbackup files. <em>Basically one backup file for each day that Firefox has been opened.</em> </p><p>This is the name format for the bookmarksbackup files that Firefox saves. bookmarks-2019-09-04_49_VVMGpcQs8dOF6v5tiFbSyQ==.jsonlz4 <strong>2019-09-04</strong> is the date of the file and <strong>_49</strong> is the number of bookmarks in that file. </p><p>I have never had the problem of duplicated bookmarks, but I wonder if the ""count"" of the backup bookmarks is duplicated, too? I think it is worth checking your <strong>/bookmarksbackup/</strong> folder in your Profile folder to see if you have any bookmarksbackup files that are half of what the most current backup files show. <em>But then again if this problem has been going on for awhile you could have 2 weeks worth of duplicated bookmarks.</em> </p> id:1257495,created:2019-10-08 03:38:58 -0800,updated:2019-10-08 03:38:58 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>FredMcD <a href=""#answer-1257331"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> If you have sync, and there is a problem anywhere,<br> <strong>Shut Down Sync Immediately On All Devices</strong> </blockquote> <p>Does the problem continue? </p> id:1257492,created:2019-10-08 02:16:17 -0800,updated:2019-10-08 02:16:17 -0800,creator:erik.de.rijk,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Dear Fred, Unfortunately removal of the places.sqlite file (on both windows machines) didn't solve the problem.

Initially, Firefox was set to allow this. Around june 2017, one update changed that option, but I was able to set some parameters to still allow the full buffering, following the explanations on that thread: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/tr/questions/1168957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/tr/questions/1168957</a> </p><p>Now, it's not working again, and I presume something has changed in a recent update.

The basic problem is the eventual discrepancy between your internetspeed and the basic idea of the mediasource funcion used nowadays basically everywhere, wich negotiates a loading of videoslices or minibuffers. The next slice is not transferred until your playback hits a certain point of the minibuffer, wich leads to the minibuffer running empty if your internetspeed is slower than the Mbps of the content you try to watch without interrupts. This function was initially invented to get rid of the worldwide bandwidth used for buffered but never watched content. </p><p>it is possible that the size of the bufferslices isn´t controlled only by the client/consumer of the content, maybe the websites got also updated controls wich makes these chunksizes fixed since a few month. </p><p>you could turn off the mediasource funktion completely by setting this to false media.mediasource.enabled in about:config For youtube this disables the bufferslicing and prevents resolutions higher than 720p, but other websites may get unable to show any video at all. </p> id:1257747,created:2019-10-09 05:59:33 -0800,updated:2019-10-09 05:59:33 -0800,creator:ego2alter2,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Any suggestion please?

I'd like to know if any of you can help me with my problem with cache. </p><p>So I've noticed that when using Firefox, oftentimes the cache is being cleared/purged automatically, for reasons I don't know yet. I'd like to know how I can keep the cache, or in other words, prevent Firefox from clearing the cache for any reason whatsoever. I really need the cache and I don't mind keeping a large or even massive cache. I'm browsing the same sites over and over again and I'd like to keep the cache instead of having to download it again everytime I browse the sites with Firefox. </p><p>The problem is I've tried things like disabling smart cache size and increasing my disk cache to 4 GB to no avail. Firefox always clears the cache automatically after certain period of time or under certain or specific condition(s). The thing is I don't know how to stop Firefox from tampering with my cache. None of my add-ons is actually tampering with the cache, nevermind clearing it. </p><p><br> Several settings that I've changed/modified manually: </p><p>・ browser.cache.auto_delete_cache_version: set to -1. </p><p>・ browser.cache.check_doc_frequency: set to 2. </p><p>・ browser.cache.disk.capacity: set to 4096000.  I read somewhere that a Firefox users and a fellow photographer managed to increase the size to 16 GB with his Firefox 69 and is able to keep his cache until he clears it manually, but I failed to repro his steps since my Firefox always reverted back to 380 MB or something whenever I did that. He's probably using custom userChrome and/or userContent css. </p><p>All these settings are set to false: ・ browser.cache.disk.smart_size.enabled  ・ browser.cache.disk.smart_size.first_run  ・ browser.cache.disk.smart_size.use_old_max </p><p>・ browser.cache.memory.capacity: set to 2048000. </p><p>・ media.cache_size: sometimes I set this to 4096000 to see if it helps with anything, but most of the time it is set to its default value (unchanged). </p><p>・ browser.tabs.remote.warmup.enabled: set to false. I might accidentally added this to my 56.0.2 (and set it to false) since I don't remember tab warming being in pre-Quantum, but my 69.0.2 has this and I set it to false. There is also a thing with mouse cursor hovering over a tab making it reload the tab, but only after Firefox clear my cache. </p><p><br> If any of you curious about why I'm using 56.0.2, it's because I'm still using Multi Paste and Go add-on, which is a Godsend to me. It's really helpful with accessing or opening several links or images at once, oftentimes more than 30-40 images, and unfortunately the add-on is not made compatible with 69.0.2. I'm a very careful person when it comes to security and I never opened any sites with questionable or suspicious quality, just things related to work (photography) and bills (So-Net Nuro, Softbank, etc.) so please don't worry about my browsing habits or security risks. I also always disable Flash plugin. </p><p>At this point, I really have no idea how to prevent Firefox from clearing my cache. Sometimes Firefox clears my cache when I am still browsing, sometimes when I leave it idle. Sometimes I can reach over 1 GB of cache size before Firefox clears it, sometimes Firefox clears the cache when the size is still about 100-200 MB. </p><p>I always perform system maintenance manually (from updating OS to installing drivers, from setting up Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to making backups) so I'd rather clearing my cache manually instead of letting Firefox do that for me. </p><p>Can any of you help me with my problem with cache? </p><p>I appreciate and thank for the help, advice, suggestion and assistance you could provide. I don't mind using custom userChrome or userContent as long as you don't mind guiding me with it (I never used it before).  </p><p>I'm looking forward to get your help and feedback.

While I have unlimited data cap and very fast connection when I'm at home (in Tokyo), I don't always have unlimited data cap and fast connection when I'm working for photography projects anywhere else, especially overseas. Having my cache intact and my browser not tampering with it can be extremely helpful during times when data cap is limited and speed is slow, especially when I'm accessing my own cloud storage and managing images or opening sites like Flickr Pro.

Mozilla has gone so far as getting rid of full themes and lately the light-weight themes <em>(formerly known as Personas)</em>  have lost UI features that they had in the past. Mozilla has also limited extensions such as Stylish, as far as how much in the way of modifications that an extension is able do. IMO, effectively making Stylish mostly worthless in comparison to the Legacy versions of Firefox and pre-WebExtension formats. </p><p>That said, many users are using userChrome.css code to modify the appearance and in some cases pretty extensively.

Many web pages try to send Email through the default browser; one example is WeatherBug when you click on feedback. When I do that (on Chrome, incidentally), an infinite loop seems to be created with mailto because I don't have Firefox set up to send Email (and don't particularly want to do so). When this occurs, I have to quit or sometimes force quit and reopen Firefox. It would not bother me if a single tab were created with an error message, but many, many tabs are created in that infinite loop. I suspect that this is a bug in the way Firefox processes such mailto requests. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-690;firefox-6901;,firefox,other,en-US,1256716;,stevegoldfield,"id:1256716,created:2019-10-04 08:21:42 -0800,updated:2019-10-04 08:21:42 -0800,creator:stevegoldfield,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I should add that although I am running Beta Catalina (release 10), I have observed this issue for a few years when I was running production Mojave as well.

That could be caused by blocking third party cookies or possibly other settings. Because the site requires an account, it's difficult for support forum volunteers to test. </p><p>If a site is generally known to work in Firefox, these are standard suggestions to try when it stops working normally: </p><p><strong>Double-check content blockers:</strong> Firefox's Content Blocking/Tracking Protection feature, and extensions that counter ads and tracking, may break websites that embed third party content (meaning, from a secondary server). </p><p>(A) Do you see a shield icon toward the left end of the address bar, near the lock icon? More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop</a> (before Firefox 70: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>). </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p>You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

1269949,2019-10-02 16:37:00 -0800,2019-10-03T14:12:44Z,how to get 'save this bookmark' back and how to get a longer list of favorites folders when adding a bookmark,"<p>I seem to have a related problem now, along with my original problem, that prevents me from using Firefox as my default web browser. For some reason now, all of a sudden, the menu option ""save this bookmark"" has disappeared from my list to do so!!!! I have attached a screen shot so you can see what I mean. My main problem that I find infuriating, is when I want to save a bookmark to my long list of favorites folders (well over 300, not including the sub-folders!!) is that the number of clicks that are needed to just get the list, but once the list is accessible, all I can see is about a list of the top 5 or 6 folders!!! This takes me WAY too long to scroll through my list to find the right folder, and if I have the same named sub-folder, in multiple main folders, how do I know which one I am in, unless I scroll up and down to verify which one of the main folders I am currently in? I still use IE just because theirs is so much easier to use and doesn't take anywhere near as long to add a bookmark, but since it is so old, I keep getting a notice that it is out of date, even if it will display the webpage properly given the changes to how webpages are now programmed and IE no longer gets any updates. Chrome is even worse, given that they constantly want to keep track of you or have you log in to anything of theirs that you use, so I don't use Google. What I want is a simple button (like what is/was) available in IE that with one click gets me a long list of my folders so that I can see my many many folders to choose from, can scroll through the list as needed to make a selection, WITH all folders and sub-folders visible, select the one I want, and if necessary an option to add a new sub-folder, and then I am done, and it closes (I have added a screen shot of what IEs list looks like and you can see the button on the top left of my favorites menu down the left hand side, to add a new bookmark) I have counted the number of clicks needed to finish adding a bookmark in Fire fox and in IE and the number difference is ridiculous!! WHY CAN'T THIS BE SIMPLER????? But now for some reason I can't even add a new bookmark since it is missing, so I guess Firefox no longer wants me to use their software by allowing the option from being removed! How did this happen?! Everything about Firefox is terrific I find EXCEPT this lack of ability to simple add a bookmark to a favorite folder. This prevents me from making Firefox my go-to browser. I want to switch over, but since you make it too complicated, FORGET IT!!!! If you ever change this to something more suitable, I am all ready to make the switch, but it is seriously lacking. </p><p>For right now I need to know how to add a bookmark, and, is there any way to tell Firefox to make the list of folders when adding a bookmark longer? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-690;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1256542;,craigmchamberlain,"id:1256542,created:2019-10-03 14:12:44 -0800,updated:2019-10-03 14:12:44 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>To the best of my knowledge, there's no way to make the folder list longer. </p><p>As for adding bookmarks, the reason that the ""Save this bookmark"" option isn't in your screenshot appears to be because you already have the page bookmarked. That's why you have the ""Edit this bookmark"" option instead. </p><p>You can tell it's bookmarked because the star in the Firefox address bar is blue. If the page was not already in your bookmarks, it would be just a grey outline star. </p><p>A good tip as well is that you can simply click that star to either add a page to the bookmarks or edit the bookmark, instead of going through the Library drop-down menu. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Works on other box.  .CSS issue?","<p>This question has been asked before, tried the solutions.  Adblock disabled, cookies and cache cleared, theme set to default.  About:config options tweaked to defaults.   Specific example: This wikipedia site: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations</a>  has math equations and matrix images, which fail to render.  They appear briefly, then disappear.  Flash plugin disabled.  Perhaps default .CSS files altered?  How to check this?  Note: FF menu: Tools/Page-Info/Media shows equation images fine. Also, can click on blank part of screen where image is, and right-click ""view image"", and math equations/matrix images render ok.  But page show only blank white space.   Guys, this should not be this hard, here in 2019.  Default .CSS might have been changed in my desperate attempts to change horrible bright-white page to a dark-theme.   FIrefox with super-bright-white page is a bad experience, but blanked-out non-display-of-inline images, of course, makes Firefox sadly useless.  If I can find the solution, I will post it here.   This should *not* be this difficult.  If the image can be rendered with a right-click to view it, the browser should just render that in-line in the page, and not display a blank white space, which it does now.   This is an error that simply should not occur.

The default value for the ""about:config"" parameter: ""browser.display.document_color_use"" is ""0"" (ie. a numeric zero).  This value (which allows *most* webpages to render correctly with embedded images), also causes the pages to have superbright white backgrounds.  And on the Wikipedia math stuff, it causes all the math/equation images to render as blank white. (see first attached screen-image). In the second attached screen-image, the only difference is that the ""browser.display.document_color_use"" value, in ""about:config"" has been set to ""2"". This (given the altered colors on some of the about:config ""color"" parms), gives a readable, dark-theme page, but also prevents many images from rendering - including that little globe in the top left corner of every wikipedia page. </p><p>So, is this a messed-up .CSS issue? If so, how to resolve? Or, is the Firefox software just broken-by-design?  Or is there a fix?   If someone actually knows answer, Pls advise. Thanx so much. The ""We don't support, do upgrade"" is a really stupid, non-answer.  I will find the solution,and post it here, since this is an ongoing problem that has been around for *years*. (Google results prove this.) Bear with me, while I track down, and determine the fix...  :) </p><p>Two attached files:  First shows blank white page, second shows page with colors adjusted.  But that dark page will not render some images also. This is fixable problem, I am sure.  All the add-ons, APB, Flash stuff, etc. is disabled.  What we need is the ability to fix the superbright white page *AND* show web-page images, yes?  I know this is doable. Will post result here, when I determine what the fix is.  :) Gemesys() </p> id:1256348,created:2019-10-02 12:55:54 -0800,updated:2019-10-02 12:55:54 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Those are SVG images: </p> <ul><li>view-source:<a href=""https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4460866202afb67e822389a6b11a0b453c89c1c7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4460866202afb67e822389a6b11a0b453c89c1c7</a> </li></ul> <p>If you use extensions (""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Extensions) that can block content (Adblock Plus, NoScript, Disconnect, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin) always make sure such extensions do not block content. </p> <ul><li>make sure your extensions and filters are updated to the latest version </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems</a> </li></ul> <p>Firefox shows the shield icon at the left end of the location/address bar in case Content Blocking is blocking content. </p> <ul><li>click the shield icon for more details and possibly disable the protection </li></ul> <p>You can check the Web Console about what content is blocked </p> <ul><li>""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Web Developer </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/content-blocking</a> </li></ul> id:1256341,created:2019-10-02 12:26:32 -0800,updated:2019-10-02 12:26:32 -0800,creator:user633449,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Firefox 52 is no longer supported.

Further investigating I found a config file in the /defaults/pref folder that is added by Bitdefender my anti-virus product. Two questions: With this setting set to True, does that mean that Firefox will ignore the enabled DoH and use my configured resolvers?

1269916,2019-10-02 03:21:42 -0800,2019-10-04T08:50:33Z,Just another 'move tabs and address bar' to the bottom question.,"<p>Hi folks! I spent a significant amount of time trying to move tab and address bar to the bottom of the window including address suggestion popup involved stuff several years ago when Opera was deprecated and pulled out of Gentoo repository completely. My partly working recipe was: </p><pre>   @namespace ""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>"";    @-moz-document url(""chrome://browser/content/browser.xul"") {        #PopupAutoCompleteRichResult {            /* bindings.xml in the same folder as userChrome.css */            -moz-binding: url(""bindings.xml#urlbar-popup"") !important;        }        #appMenu-popup {            -moz-binding: url(""bindings.xml#appmenu-popup"") !important;        }        #navigator-toolbox {            display: contents !important;        }        #nav-bar {             -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;        }        #TabsToolbar {             -moz-box-ordinal-group: 3 !important;        }    } </pre> <p>While this caused slight overlap of address suggestion window/popup over top of address bar, that was pretty annoying, but still acceptable. Recently, firefox-68.1.0 update rolled in to Gentoo stable repository. That update brought compilation against system libs and caused FF to start with an empty window. After pocking around and messing with plugins, I came to a conclusion, that this is my innocent tweaks that causes FF to start with no windows at all, so I was forced to disable this section and ended up with default layout with address and tab bar at the top of the FF window. Since I have KDE tabs at the top, this make a mess, and make it difficult to figure out whats going on. </p><p>Since I'm not really good at CSS things, can anybody give me a hand to do the fallowing: </p><p>1) move tab bar to the most bottom of the window; </p><p>2) move address bar just above tab bar; </p><p>3) make address suggestion window/popup roll UP just above address bar </p><p>4) keep main menu (activated by Alt) stay at top where it is by default. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-680;,firefox,customize,en-US,1256420;1256429;1256564;1256690;1256730;,e-pirate,"id:1256730,created:2019-10-04 08:50:33 -0800,updated:2019-10-04 08:50:33 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>If you want the Tab bar at the bottom of the Firefox window then you need a lot more code to get this done properly.

Chrome or IE doesn't have the same problem. Troubleshooting performed so far: 1. Tried running Firefox for a full day in Safe Mode: Still crashes - bp-d9e945ed-e475-4b92-a449-e3b620191002 2. Tried ESR version of Firefox - no improvement. 3. Re-installed Firefox a few times - no improvement. 4. Chrome, IE, Edge do not have the same problem but they are not Firefox : ) 5. Reviewed the Firefox crashes knowledge base and tried everything listed there. Last test was to use Firefox for a day in Safe Mode (wasn't easy but I coped with it) </p><p>Something i've noticed (not 100% sure about it) is that if I leave a private window open the crash is somehow more likely to occur. </p><p>So far my observations are that this is some sort of a memory leak-like problem as just before the crash tabs on the browser and some content on pages becomes blank when I hover over with the mouse.

1269899,2019-10-01 18:52:16 -0800,2019-10-02T05:00:20Z,Bookmarks toolbar randomly rearranges itself,"<p>This issue has been around for years with no actual solution.  I recently finally got around to disconnecting three of my devices (laptop, Samsung tablet and Samsung smartphone) from Firefox Sync in order to determine if the problem is sync-related. The bookmarks toolbar on my main device (another laptop) were still being randomly rearranged. I therefore disconnected this laptop from sync as well. The bookmarks toolbar has since been stable with no rearranging. This is telling me that this is a sync issue, not an issue with a corrupt places.sqlite file, an add-on/plug-in or hardware acceleration, as previously suggested by Mozilla, which was then marked as a solution. Sync has often been quite useful, but since I have my bookmarks (folders) arranged in alphabetical order on the toolbar for quick access and use them all frequently, I'd rather forego sync than deal with constant reordering of the bookmarks toolbar. I gather from what I've read that this problem also exists in the Google Chrome web browser. Even if the problem is a corrupted places.sqlite file, surely the sheer number of users experiencing the issue would suggest a bug or vulnerability with that file, irrespective of what add-ons are installed since the likelihood of all those users having the same add-on(s) installed is probably minimal.  Surely it's about time Mozilla properly investigated (e.g. what add-on(s) is causing the issue, how the places.sqlite file can become corrupted, how sync is causing the problem, etc., etc. and disseminating the findings to users) and actually solved this issue instead of expecting users (the IT-savvy ones at least) to waste time doing their own futile troubleshooting. I really don't think that I should have had to disconnect from sync in order to ""fix"" this problem. </p>",desktop;beta;sync;bookmarks;escalate;bug_1;syncerr;firefox-700;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1256259;1256264;1256270;,OzMerry,"id:1256270,created:2019-10-02 05:00:20 -0800,updated:2019-10-02 05:00:20 -0800,creator:OzMerry,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>the-edmeister <a href=""#answer-1256259"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote>IMO, based upon the sheer number of user complaints / support question posted here about Sync that include the Firefox for Android or Firefox for iOS -- those ""mobile"" devices as they are connected to Sync are most likely the true cause for the corruption you have experienced.

And the issue may be exacerbated by the user once corruption is seen by the user and the user attempts to correct the faults they see in a piecemeal fashion which then adds to the corruption.</blockquote> <p>All the more reason for definitive (i.e. not ""most likely"", ""may be exacerbated"", ""should fix"", ""I believe"", etc.), easy-to-understand information and troubleshooting tips for syncing. Despite the many different possible scenarios, Mozilla can't reasonably expect <u>all</u> Firefox users to understand how it all works, and condescendingly implying that it's always the user's fault isn't helpful, serves only to increase user frustration and doesn't engender a positive, approachable support environment, bearing in mind that user perception will inevitably differ from that of Mozilla support staff. </p><p>There's not much point in having the sync functionality at all if it is so vulnerable to user misunderstanding and/or so reliant on specific considerations and doesn't instead just work. Why, for example, is it so: <b>""...the ""mobile bookmarks"" and the Bookmarks Toolbar on the desktop / laptop versions of Firefox are handled differently on the Sync server.""</b>? </p><p>Firefox users shouldn't need to be concerned about that sort of thing. </p> id:1256264,created:2019-10-02 03:44:26 -0800,updated:2019-10-02 03:55:11 -0800,creator:OzMerry,updated_by:OzMerry,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p><em>the-edmeister <a href=""#answer-1256259"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> <em><strong>""I gather from what I've read that this problem also exists in the Google Chrome web browser.""</strong></em>  Apples and oranges.

Depending upon how you do that may be indirectly causing those bookmarks to become askew - <strong>especially if that Firefox installation is connected to Sync when you attempt to ""fix"" them</strong>.   <em>The first few changes get sent to the Sync server immediately, but after the first few changes ""the system"" switches to what I would call a batch mode. Waiting to send subsequent batches of changes to the Sync server all at once when ""the system"" thinks the changes have been stopped. At least that is what I have observed repeatedly when I have experimented with trying to push Sync to the point of breakage with a couple of Sync accounts.</em> </p><p>Current recommendation when using Sync and re-arranging bookmarks manually is to disconnect from Sync before beginning to rearrange bookmarks manually by dragging bookmarks or folders of bookmarks around in the user interface.  <em>Not sure if using ""Sort by Name"" in the Library is affected when Firefox is connected to the Sync server, or not. I have not experimented with that ""Sort by Name"" feature in the Library window.</em> </p> <hr> <p>Overall, my advice is with your most used Firefox version disconnected from Sync to change your Sync password and then re-connect to Sync on that device.  Doing that will serve to clear your corrupt data from the Sync server and that should fix your problem with your bookmarks toolbar getting re-arranged. Then the following day connect the other laptop to Sync and make sure that your bookmarks toolbar bookmarks problem is fixed. Wait a few days before connecting your ""mobile devices"" to your Sync account; or don't connect them at all. </p> <hr> <p>IMO, based upon the sheer number of user complaints / support question posted here about Sync that include the Firefox for Android or Firefox for iOS -- those ""mobile"" devices as they are connected to Sync are most likely the true cause for the corruption you have experienced.

Know what hardware and router would be the start here. I have HP 8450 and HP M277dw and both Ethernet connect to a NetGear Nighthawk N7500v2 and have no issues with Ethernet connections. You said when you go to print it crashes. From just that I think the problem is the router or the wire connection or Ethernet wire issue. And my 8450 has straight through Ethernet and the M277dw had BiDirectional Ethernet to the same router without issue. And my two laptops can't connect to both printer and print from them and scan from the M277dw. So I think you got more issues and it's translating to the Browser when you print. Also I would not use HP scan doctor that is worthless and probably not going to fix the problem. When I installed the HP software for the M277dw I only did the basic with error reporting software installed no diagnosis software. Those have never worked for me. And still through the M277 it can updates itself as it did once and I have had no issues with that. So I think it sounds more like you need a actual computer repair person to be there and finding where the real problem is coming from and it sounds like there is more then one thing that need live person to see what is going on. </p> id:1257022,created:2019-10-05 14:17:09 -0800,updated:2019-10-05 14:17:09 -0800,creator:betty.debelak,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi philipp, </p><p>I have the latest update you mentioned.

You'd think that this browser would wake up and remember what users are inputting.  There are few things more aggravating than being asked the same question over and over.  It is utterly astounding that so many software designers seem to be unable to comprehend this.  I wonder if they are truly living in another dimension.  To think that so much of our lives are controlled by these mindless idiots is so sad.  No wonder so much of our society is so inefficient.   The problem seems to be centered on calling with Gmail.  Calling with Google Hangouts seems to be fine.  It may be a Flash problem.  Probably as Adobe is such a horrible company, being so intrusive and stubborn in so much of their products.  I guess Google chose them as a lesser of several evils.  The thing is I've gone into Control Panel, Flash Player (though it says its 32 bit and I'm on a 64 bit system) and allowed <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> yet it still doesn't make a difference.  In Firefox Permissions (hey, how come about:permissions no longer works?) I see <a href=""http://Hangouts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Hangouts.google.com</a> is there but <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> is not there even though I've allowed it 100 times.  Why would it not be retained?  That is probably the problem.  And looking at that stupid Permissions page is so aggravating.  Such a total design failure.  You can Remove All Websites, but you can't ADD ANY WEBSITES.  IDIOTS!!!!  If I could, Gmail wouldn't ask me every time I laod or refresh the page.
