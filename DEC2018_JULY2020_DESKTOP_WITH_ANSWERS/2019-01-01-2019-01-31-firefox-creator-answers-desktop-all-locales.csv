No apache server needed or wanted for simplicity - just a bunch of pages and links. However, I want to be able to either do other (non-firefox) things when the home web page has been showing for 5 minutes (which means nobody is using the system).

Now whenever i alt+tab back to the browser, it would select the entire text inside the password container instead of just leaving it as it is, thus making me replace the text I've already typed instead of just adding to it. That also happens a lot with the address bar. Now I'm a pretty unfocused individual, and I know I can press the right arrow key on the keyboard to just avoid this selection, but it seems like firefox is the only browser who does that sort of thing and it always gets me on surprise. Then I have this whole frustration moment, because that usually happens when I got to rush and log in, and when I'm already finishing the input. Is there any way to force firefox to stop this selection madness? Any help will be appreciated, and thank you all for your time. I hope I was clear enough...

We're a TLS everywhere, VPN everywhere shop. We very much know the implications of security workarounds. TL;DR: Shibboleet. </p><p>While deploying our systems, we routinely have to directly access our customers' legacy systems that are ridden with SSL/TLS problems of almost every category: outdated algorithms, inadequate key lengths, hardcoded certificates, reused serials and so on. Some of these limitations can be worked around in the browser, others require configuring insecure settings, a few cannot be done away with. ""Contacting the site admininistrator and letting them know there's something wrong with their site"" is a non-option here. We're talking about *unfixable* systems whose design life is measured in two-digit years. </p><p>The question is: how am I supposed to cope with this?

Unfortunately, if you have configured the Firefox setting of ""Block cookies and site data"" to ""Cookies from unvisited websites"", my iframe widgets no longer work when used on a cross origin domain, as they rely on user sessions.  Is there any documentation that defines what 3rd party cookies are?  I understand some users want to block them (as I myself was doing until I realized that would break my iframe widgets), but what I don't understand is why the cookies are continually blocked if a user specifically interacts with an iframe widget.  Doesn't user interaction imply it's now a visited website?  I should think the first load of the iframe would trigger blocked cookies, but if the user interacts with the iframe content willingly (by clicking a button which triggers an ajax call, for example), any resulting cookies should be respected even if Firefox is set to block 3rd party cookies.  I'm all for blocking 3rd party cookies that are loaded dynamically and are unwelcome, but if the user starts interacting with these iframes or controls, it would make sense to allow cookies, and that would be enough for my apps to not be broken if the user blocks 3rd party cookies.  I think web developers need a solution for keeping their legitimate cross origin apps from being blocked by 3rd party cookie settings if users are interacting and using them. </p><p>I put together a sample application that shows how Firefox blocking third party cookies completely breaks sessions (since the cookie that is returned from the iframe call is discarded / not used). </p><p><a href=""https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-test</a> </p><p>I created a basic test to see if I could get Firefox to maintain sessions with iframes using a cross origin domain as the source. Unfortunately, I could not. Is there any work-around, or an easy way to detect the user's 3rd party cookie settings so I can warn them? I'd still like to know what is considered 3rd party, and what happens if you visit the cross origin domain directly in another tab before interacting with that iframe. Is it still considered 3rd party then?  What is the behavior and rules for this?   </p><p>This seems like a serious problem that needs a better solution, and I like the interaction idea. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-640;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1193121;,own3mall

But I am now running into a few websites that won't permit this browser, so it may be time to move on.    With heavy adblocking and tracker-blocking and my benign web browsing habits, I've not been concerned about security (never had a virus in 20 years - knock wood).  It's just full functionality and slowness at this point.  At this point, I see even my Classic Theme Restorer is no longer available, so I'll just have to bite the bullet on aesthetics and deal with a modern browser.   However, a couple of things are unclear: </p><p>1. does 20 years of bookmark history (and remembered history) affect memory footprint.  I only refer to existing bookmarks occasionally these days and may consider a full purge.  Partial purge would probably be too time-consuming.  Maybe even a full profile purge might be worthwhile for a true clean slate.  Maybe FF has come a long way and old extensions and settings won't be necessary.  I also have several about: settings that I may (or may not?) miss. </p><p>2.  Are automatic updates unavoidable in newer versions?   I read about ""manual"" but it sounded temporary. </p><p>3.   The permissions on many potential add-ons I've looked at are quite unnerving... e.g many of them require full access to ALL my data (usernames and passwords!!!) and I know the function has no need for such.    Who has time to investigate these fully for safety?  Is there any anti-malware vetting required for add-ons to be available? </p><p>4.  I know newer is generally faster, but FF has a history of growing and slowing down after upgrades.  My hardware isn't getting any newer (although its more than ample for my current needs), but software tends to be developed on latest and greatest hardware.  How does latest FF compare to circa V41 in memory usage? </p><p><br> In any case, I thought I would give the latest vesion a whirl on my old Vista laptop (which is currently at V43) and check it out before plunging in on my W7 work PC or home PC.    Any answers or insight into such a big jump are much appreciated. </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;escalate;update;hardquestion;firefox-410;blockupgrade;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1191457;1193423;1193439;1193451;1193533;1193664;1193665;1193760;1193773;1194651;1194680;1194699;1194726;1194967;1194988;1195018;1195077;1195268;1196044;1196057;1196425;1196561;1196568;1196694;,Wendy444

I usually have several tabs pinned and open, sometimes those tabs will hang when they reload themselves (<a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, Remember the Milk, Yahoo mail, etc). Sometimes a website in a new tab will hang - but if I close the tab and go to the same site/link in a new tab, it will load fine. Once one tab hangs, it seems to cause other tabs to start hanging, but not 100% sure about that.  </p><p>But there are two sites that ALWAYS cause it to hang: <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> and the Firefox Troubleshooting page. For Amazon, that one tab will hang and I can usually close that tab (takes a few seconds to close). For Troubleshooting page, it locks up the whole app and I have to force quit. </p><p>Safe mode DOES work. I can get to Amazon and Troubleshooting page. But on a clean fresh install with no extensions installed (or enabled, see below), these pages will still hang. Is there another difference with Safe Mode? </p><p>Note that this is on a laptop that is provided by my employer and it's possible that there's some other software involved.

I can't seem to remove them. (I have another Mac at home that runs on Cisco's network, but I don't know what it has installed - not there now, I can check this later if it's relevant.)

The keyboard's behavior is erratic when using Firefox to read news.  It occurs *almost always* when browsing Google News, and *sometimes* with NPR news, StatesReports, and possibly others.  Those are the three I read regularly. </p><p>Today, the misbehavior on both of my Windows computers, in both safe and normal modes: when Google News is launched, the ""Up"", ""Down"", ""Left"", and ""Right"" arrow keys do nothing except move a cursor around within page elements; the ""Page down"" &amp; ""Page up"", work correctly, but the ""End"" and ""Home"" keys do nothing.  At other times, successive presses of the page down will work correctly a couple of times, and the next press will perform a page up and the following press results in a page down then the next press results in another page up.  This loop continues.  From that point pressing the end key or the home key does nothing.  At other times, the keys perform as expected.  At still other times the Down arrow performs END, and Up arrow performs HOME. The HOME and END KEYS seem to move the cursor left and right within the element which has the FOCUS. </p><p>The Chrome browser works fine. </p><p>I have two computers running Windows 7 Professional.  My laptop is a Lenovo X220.  My Desktop is a homebuilt PC based on a Gigabyte motherboard.  The laptop is a refurb bought from Amazon in August 2016 and came with Windows 7 professional installed. The PC's Win 7 was installed from a system builder ""Intended for Distribution with a refurbished PC"" disc about 2 1/2 years ago (June 2016).  Both machines have been running without any significant problems until several months ago.  Now both have the same problem, while another pc running linux mint does not have the problem. </p><p>I have restarted Firefox with add-ons disabled and the problem persists, so I don't believe it is caused by any of the add-ons. I swapped out multiple keyboards, checked both machines for malware using Malwarebytes, restarted Firefox and rebooted the computers several times, and tried running without Microsoft Security Essentials; I decided the Firefox profiles must be the source of the problem, so on Jan 12, 2019 I completely uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox on the PC and it worked fine (keyboard problem gone) so I did the same thing on the laptop, and it also worked correctly.  I figured the problem was gone.  Then, four days later (the 16th) the problem restarted, on both machines. </p><p>I am wondering if there might be a problem with a Firefox or Windows update, since the keyboard issue occurred at roughly the same time on both machines.  It seems odd that both computers worked correctly for four days and simultaneously the problem restarted.  I certainly don't want to reinstall Windows just to see if that helps. </p><p>Any advice will be greatly be appreciated. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-640;firefox-6402;,firefox,other,en-US,1189693;1189694;1189752;1189757;,bachswine

If I begin a new search in FF, my search correctly uses DDG. But, if I use macOS's Spotlight to initiate a search, it correctly opens my default browser, FF, then searches with Google. Here are some background details.  </p><p>1. Open Spotlight and type a search term (e.g. 'KITTENS') 2. Force *web* (rather than local search) in Spotlight field: command+B 3. Default browser (Firefox) correctly opens.  4. Firefox correctly places search expression in Firefox's search field; e.g. <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kittens&amp;t=ffnt&amp;atb=v113-2&amp;ia=web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kittens&amp;t=ffnt&amp;atb=v113-2&amp;ia=web</a> 5. About a second later, the DDG search term is replaced by a Google search; e.g. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?rls=en_GB&amp;q=kittens&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?rls=en_GB&amp;q=kittens&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8</a> </p><p>Notes:  1. This happens on the three macs that I use.  2. It does not happen if I have Safari as my default browser (Spotlight correctly opens a DDG search on Safari).  3. I don't have Google even listed as a possible browser in Firefox.  4. I looked in some Firefox forums and couldn't find any similar comments. 5. I've spent time browsing for others with the same problem but haven't seen anything coming up. Maybe just me or maybe I'm unusual in browsing from Spotlight.  6. I do not have Google as a non-default browser in FF (i.e., it's nothing obviously like it's tripping up on DDG and picking Google as my next choice - Google's not on the list).  7. The Troubleshooting Information field below mentions '    ""keyGoogleFound"": true,' Does this mean that Google is somehow 'baked in' to FF and this is the source of the problem?  </p><p><br> Thanks very much :-) </p>",mac-os;desktop;firefox-640;firefox-6402;,firefox,other,en-US,1189674;1189676;1189677;1189787;,RobinJ

1247036,2019-01-17 04:51:43 -0800,2019-01-22T14:42:03Z,Why does FireFox think I'm in Canada?,"<p>So I recently got a new laptop (a Thinkpad P72) at work and so I installed the latest version of FireFox on it (this PC also has MS Edge, IE and Chrome installed on it). After using it for a bit I started to notice that every site I went to was displaying the Canadian version of that site for me despite living in the US and I'm dumbfounded as to why. Even the IT department at my job has no idea what's causing this as there isn't any kind of VPN or anything of that nature at play here. Part of what makes this so confusing is that FireFox is the only thing on my PC that seems to think I'm in Canada (specifically Toronto, Canada). Chrome, IE, Edge and literally everything else on this PC recognizes that I'm in the US.  </p><p>For what I do at my job this is something of a non-issue but I like to browse the web on my lunch break and so this issue is endlessly frustrating in that regard especially since I vastly prefer FireFox over all other web browsers. I don't have this problem on my PC at home despite being logged into the same FireFox Account. I've done a quick Google search and it appears that this issue isn't entirely uncommon but I'm yet to find a solution that works for me so any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-640;,firefox,other,en-US,1189329;1189332;1189359;1189385;1189538;1189681;1189711;1189895;1190457;,thepenguin55

Unfortunately, while I can go into the Library window, select a tag, select all the items with that tag, and hit CTRL + X, doing this still only seems to copy the bookmark (despite graying it out like it knew what CTRL + X was supposed to do). Now I have duplicates, and deleting them presents equally probably-a-bug problems. Even if I figure out which duplicate is the ""old"" bookmark under the tag (such as by renaming them and checking which one was added to the target folder), deleting it deletes both. The best workaround I've been able to figure out is to temporarily change the target URL of the one I'm about to delete, since, as I correctly deduced (thanks @mybrain), it's deleting based on the target. Is there any better workaround, or should I report this as a bug (as I was going to do anyway) and hope for a fix? Also, where would the best place to make that report be? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-640;firefox-6402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1193915;1203476;1203529;,Twisted_Code

Running Windows 7, 32bit. I always run the most current version of Nightly. Last week sometime it started behaving strangely after updates. If an update has been downloaded and I close and restart Nightly, no application window will open. If I open Task Manager and look at the processes, there will be somewhere between 4 and 30 instances of firefox.exe running. They will cyclically open and close but there always at least 4 processes going which I think is baseline for e10 Nightly behavior. If I try to terminate the processes, I receive an error saying the process cannot be terminated. The only way out is to reboot the computer. Of course when I try to reboot, I get a message from Windows saying a background program is running that must be closed before I can restart (I think it is the typical Task Host process). In any case, when I reboot and open Nightly again, it starts up normally and has been updated. Since there are daily updates, this has been occurring daily and it is starting to get on my nerves!

A week ago I noticed some problems with one website I was using and so thought that maybe it's because I was using outdated browser or something like that. To check this out I updated Firefox to newest (in that moment) version of it, but it wasn't the case, and because I didn't like the changes made to interface and other things I immediately downgraded it back to the version I was using earlier. But then I realized that all my browser history was gone. </p><p>I spent last week trying to undo or repair it, and so I found out that my browser history was still there, untouched, but for some reason older Firefox could not ""see"" it. After updating again to the newest version browser history was back and it showed again. </p><p>I tried many things, like System Restore or Firefox Sync, to somehow get the history back in the older version, but it just didn't work. </p><p>The thing is, while the history doesn't appear in version 47.0b9, the last session - tabs that I had opened - still showed, and when clicking on ""History"" button, before going into History window, there was a list of recently visited websites, and the last sites I visited before that whole situation were truly there, so I presume it has to have access to files that contain my browser history. </p><p>I am aware that there are supposedly some safety risks that come with using older version of Firefox, but I didn't experience any problems during my long usage of it so I don't see an issue. </p><p>I really need my browser history to work again in older version of Firefox, and not only because I don't like how newest version looks, but because of how search bar was changed (that is most crucial to me when it comes to this topic) and the fact that after upgrading the browser it started to work slower than before for some reason, which is quite jarring.

It is serving up half a dozen web servers running on various ports for various reasons.  E.g., Ticketing system on port 8080, an Apache-based Wiki on port 80, Nginx-based GitLab on 443 (the only https site!), etc. etc. </p><p>If I open the wiki and browse around, everything works great.  If I open a new tab and go to Gitlab on 443, everything works great.  However, as soon as I go back to the wiki and click a link (or just hit refresh), it takes me to the Gitlab error page, because it stuck an 's' on the http://webserver/wiki.php URL, and now Gitlab is trying to serve up an invalid URL at https://webserver/wiki.php. </p><p>Even though Gitlab is an internal webserver with a self-signed cert, the CA cert has been imported into Firefox so I get the green lock icon. </p><p>Troubleshooting / What doesn't work: </p><p>- The intranet page doesn't end in .dev or .foo, so it's not trying to load Google's website at that TLD. - Changing any settings in about:config doesn't help (at least none of the settings that can be found in the first few pages of a Google search). - Deleting my entire Firefox profile doesn't change anything - Running in Private Browsing / Purple screen doesn't change anything (when loading both websites in the same ""mode"" - see below). - I have checked the wiki webserver for any extraneous .htaccess files with URL redirects. - I have checked the wiki httpd.conf file(s) for any https redirects - There are no addons installed - Currently running version 60.2.2 ESR.  I will try to upgrade to 60.4.0 ESR ASAP. This behavior does NOT happen with 52.x ESR. </p><p>What DOES work, albeit temporarily: </p><p>If I go into Preferences -&gt; Clear History -&gt; select the 'Site Preferences' setting, then the wiki will load and I can click around.  However, the moment I go back to Gitlab and click on a link or refresh, the next URL I click on in the wiki will attempt to load a https version, Gitlab's webservice at port 443 takes over, and I get a 404.  Go back to Preferences and delete the site preferences, and the cycle repeats. </p><p>This behavior also exists in Private Browsing mode with both sites either in two tabs or separate Private Browsing windows. </p><p>What works ""permanently"": </p><p>If I open the wiki in Regular Browsing mode and Gitlab in Private Browsing mode (or vice versa), I can access each website simultaneously in their respective windows.  No https redirect occurs. </p><p>My conclusion: </p><p>As soon as I go to Gitlab, some Site Preferences setting gets saved that insists on redirecting all URLs at that domain to https.  This site setting gets re-added at every web page invocation/reload, as demonstrated by deleting the Site Preferences and watching the behavior start up again on a refresh.   </p><p>Site Preferences are shared among tabs in both Regular Browsing and Private Browsing, but they aren't shared BETWEEN Regular and Private browsing.  This is immaterial to the issue at hand, just an interesting observation. </p><p>This problem started between versions 52 and 60. </p><p>I don't know how site preferences are saved. This could be a GitLab problem (generating these site preferences), but then why does v52 work fine... </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1188094;1188106;1188138;1188590;1188784;,elowney

After this, all the Documentation CDs had to be run/viewed thru the AUTOPLAY.exe 1st, then 'Launch CD' (which ran LAUNCHIT.EXE I think) which put an unzipper in memory so that whatever browser you chose (on the next screen) woudl have every .htm file unzipped b4 it was passed on to the Browser.  </p><p>What I want is to copy the ENTIRE CD to my HDD and view it w/o using the CD.  </p><p>So, what I need is a Plug-in or ? so I can unzip all the .htm's within Firefox.  </p><p>I've tried posting some messages to 7Z about copying the entire CD to the HDD all the while unzippign .htm's on the fly. I was told 7z can't do it. </p><p>I used to program in C, do I have to write a program to do this ? </p><p>Seems simple enough... - find all .htm files below a certain Directory, and unzip them, using the same name, appending a unique number or letter (like -old) to the filename as the new unzipped file has to have the same name as the original. </p><p>Simple.

Fix the damn yellow-bar warnings, once and for all.  ""A web page is slowing down your browser"" is NOT a helpful diagnostic; but we've been seeing it for years now.  Please replace it with something that will lead customers to figure out how to solve it.  For starters, report WHAT site is triggering the yellow-bars. </p><p>4.

I have a desktop with over 1,000 saved logins.  The other day, I was on my laptop and synced both devices so i had the same info on each device.  Then I took about 3 hours on my laptop, deleting hundreds of old/obsolete logins and passwords.  So..... </p><p>Now I want to update my desktop with the new cleaned up saved logins from my laptop.  But I am confused.  I am thinking I should open my desktop and SYNC Firefox from there, and it will update all current desktop logins with my new cleaned up login list version from my laptop.  Or doesn't it matter, when I hit SYNC, the most recent changes will update the old changes from any device?? </p><p>I know this is probably so simple - but I am afraid to hit SYNC for fear I am doing it incorrectly . . . like plugging the wrong jumper cable to the wrong battery connection . . . I sure appreciate  someone explaining the proper way to do this.  I would hate to lose 3 hours of work. </p><p>thanks!!

I thought there's something wrong with my speaker, but I noticed when I played in Opera, it sounded good. When I first opened YouTube, they sounded good, but after I repeated the same video, the sound became so low, or when I paused the video then replayed it, it also happened. Sometimes, it already sounded low.  What I've done are refreshing Firefox, reinstall Firefox, start Firefox in safe mode, clear cache, and so many things but none of them worked. I'm certain that it was not from the volume slider as I read from some references. My Firefox version is 64.0 with Windows 10 Home. I remembered that back then, the YouTube just played nicely like always been. I don't know since when did the Firefox become like this.  Any information regards would be appreciated.

Pick one for your search site (I was using <a href=""http://Startpage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Startpage.com</a>). </p><p>It should be easy.  It was easy - before.  This time it wasn't - but did eventually work (long, long time). In the screen, you see under Post Parameters.  I was using <a href=""https://startpage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://startpage.com</a> and changing a few options. They create a URL with those settings, but they're no longer in json format.  That  may be the problem. </p><p>One result is in ""plain text"", but you'll see it's not json format.  The other URL, the custom settings are obfuscated.  I saw / tested other plugins for startpage from Mycroft that used the obfuscated string in BOTH the Post Parameters &amp; Search Form URL  entry &amp; they seemed to worked fine.  When I created mine &amp; installed (them, about 5 diff times), it wouldn't start up with the color theme selected &amp; saved in the string.   </p><p>The only way I got that to work was look at some other plugins on Mycroft &amp; after the  ""query={searchTerms}"" , I had to add ""&amp;t=dark"", or else once installed, on the 1st use from the search manager, it opened the site w/ light theme.  After another search, it recognized the dark theme chosen (&amp; saved in the string their settings page created). </p><p>Needless to say, there isn't any ""&amp;t=dark"" setting in the strings that Startpage NOW creates.  I used it because other plugins used it - even some recent ones w/ the ""new"" Startpage icon (2 blue rectangles w/ white stripe between).  But there are no json strings being created by the site anymore for custom settings. </p><p>I'm guessing that the open search form / specs like on Mycroft Project need json format data? Because the custom settings string also had 20 results per page &amp; it only shows the default of 10.  I'd guess the site ignores the settings in the plugin that don't use json?  Maybe some of the older plugins using obfuscated strings were actually json to begin with?  I don't see how the site could read (json) data if it's obfuscated. </p><p>It appears their site still recognizes the names / values in json format, if you know the correct ones.  I'd have to look in a lot of Startpage  plugins to find the correct json format abbreviations for various settings, if that's the only way an open search plugin will work.   Mozilla is making it hard for people not to use the included search engines - as is - for obvious reasons. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-640;,firefox,other,en-US,1185607;1185624;1185823;1186099;,Joebt

I have a localhost XAMPP installation which is not accessible through the Internet. I use the self-signed certificate supplied with XAMPP to enable SSL development. Let me repeat myself — I am doing my development on my own localhost with no access over the internet for my development server. This is my own machine, completely and entirely owned by me. Every time Firefox does an update, it finds a new way to tell me that it has complete control over the machine that it allows me to use only on its own terms. It does everything it can to ensure that I have no control over it. </p><p>In light of this, several years ago, I completely uninstalled Firefox, only too happy to consign it to the evil waste heap it so richly deserves. Like a complete idiot I decided to reinstall it about six months ago. Since then, I've spent weeks trying to make it work. Just when I get it somehow to work, it begins to completely bomb again. This last iteration, just one in a long series of iterations, I have spent two complete, entire, and utterly wasted DAYS trying to find a resolution to no avail. That's two days, well over 16 hours, of completely wasted time when I could have been earning money. (When is Firefox going to pay me for what that cost? Where and how do I submit my bill?) It still does not work continuing to give a Your connection is not secure.  Error code: MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT error and no alternatives for a workaround.

None of them worked. </p><p>The machine that my localhost is installed on is a Windos 10 Pro machine running Apache 2.4. I am using Firefox v.63 with the Flash plugin (not used in web development, of course). My anti-malware is Malwarebytes. When Firefox, the greatest malware of all times, decided to take control of my machine and block my web development, I completely turned off Malwarebytes to ensure that it wasn't the primary culprit. (It had never been at the root of the problem in the past. Malwarebytes makes it easy to add exceptions for an IP address such as 127.0.0.1, the IP universally used by localhosts. In any case, turning off Malwarebytes, of course, did nothing with regard to the issue created by Firefox. Naturally, Firefox would never implement such a simple resolution because, after all, they have to have complete control over my machine.) </p><p>My question is: Is there any way to permanently, totally, completely, and irrevocably prevent Firefox from blockading me from doing web development, allowing me to access with ease, localhost web sites, created in the Apache virtual host (httpd-vhost.conf) configuration file on IP 127.0.0.1 and established in the Windows hosts file (/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts)?

First, I've not been convinced to check how ""Pocket List"" differs from ""Bookmarks"" and the mere presence of its icon in the URL bar next to the “Star icon”  irritates me since each time I want to click ""bookmark"" I always experience this fraction of delay figuring out which button to press.. at the very least I would like to have the option to move the “Star icon” to the other end of the bar. Second, upon times I think to access a previously saved bookmark I instantly get this “ooof” like feeling, suggesting this to be tedious … I suspect this because:  1) The “tilted books” icon is quite ""distant"" from the “Star icon” by different measures, it's not within the same control group, and it is set apart by a substantial length compared to the distance between icons in a group, so effectively,  the “Bookmark concept"" is in two places and since I save more than I review I tend to first look at the ""star icon"" regardless of what I actually want to do with ""Bookmarks"".  I think a more intuitive design for me would have the ""star"" and ""books"" icons be adjacent visually somehow...  perhaps combining the two into a ""dropdown button"".  2) Once I do locate and click the ""books icon""  I'm  somewhat  overwhelmed by seeing many options which  all deal with ""past pages"" and it takes me another click to open the ""sub-menu"" to show the ""Bookmark list"", which itself is not really consistent with sub-menus as a UI navigation pattern. 3) ..at which point I’m presented with a relatively narrow list of descriptions having the majority of them being cut-off. This makes the whole list appear very cryptic. I would really appreciate having a one-button click experience in order to reveal my bookmarks. As a quick remedy, I would love to have the option to change the semantics of the URL bar pull down pane (e.g drop-down arrow) to show my bookmarks instead of the recently visited URL's (I never ever used this list to navigate back to a site).  </p><p>Hope this is considered... </p><p>-ffeadback </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;feedback;mac-osx-1013;firefox-640;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1185494;1185534;1185631;1185709;1185764;1185775;1185933;1186072;,ffeadback

Two weeks ago Firefox stopped allowing one of my secure websites to recognize my device at step two. Why isn't Firefox allowing a secure website to register my device at step two? Firefox allowed for step one but not the second step. I still have other secure sites where step two is working fine. This one secure site and perhaps others seem the major issue.   I checked with the website's company, my computer support system and used another server as well. The server works fine at the two step stage and it is not a website nor computer brand issue. Both I was able to contact and they worked with me. In the end it comes down to being a Firefox problem.  Something tells me it is either a simple fix or Firefox made changes effecting this process with certain websites. I need help. I have repeatedly asked Firefox for answers but it is not responding except to explain how to sign in to Firefox and that is not what I am talking about. Finally I was sent here. Can anyone help? I would rather not show the two step page but it is asking to answer additional questions each time I try to enter my account and to click a box to say they will register this device so I can skip stage two in the future. I can then enter my account but once I log out and enter later.. back to doing the entire step two again. My device was not recognized by the website using Firefox. Please help.
