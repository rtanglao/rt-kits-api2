So whatever pretense Google is making about prohibiting websites from overlaying garbage unavoidable and repetitively reappearing adwierdteasements, the reality is that <a href=""http://NASDAQ.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">NASDAQ.COM</a> is *not* complying.  Actually I suspect it has to do with Google's recent notification trashing the top line of my Firefox browser telling me that they were changing their ""terms of service"" to facilitate further abuses of anyone and everyone trying to obtain information on the web.

Two of them are synced via Firefox Sync with each other; the other is not. I am encountering chronic profile corruption issues where the main symptoms include any or all of these: bookmarks can no longer be modified (added, deleted, synced); search engine changes are not persistent; preferences are not synced among synced devices. The only solution I have found to restore full functionality is to complete uninstall Firefox, including all profiles and preference files, reboot, reinstall a fresh download, and resync via Firefox Sync. </p><p>I'd love to get some help troubleshooting what could be causing the corruption in the first place. This issue doesn't affect any other browser I use (Brave, Edge Chromium, Safari). Obviously the easiest solution would be to switch to Brave or something, but I'd prefer to stay with Firefox if possible. </p><p>Potential causes I've explored: using no extensions; uninstalling Malwarebytes, Backblaze, Parallels (running Windows). </p><p>Trouble-shooting suggestions much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1301407;1301409;1301414;1301439;1303287;,ejmacki,"id:1303287,created:2020-04-07 06:42:38 -0800,updated:2020-04-07 06:42:38 -0800,creator:ejmacki,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks for both your suggestions.

So you need to have al least one desktop / laptop device with UN-corrupted data for the first Sync event with a new FxA password. </p><p>By opening Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information and scroll down to <strong>Places Database</strong> and use the <em><strong>Verify Integrity</strong></em> button to run a 'test verification' and repair process for Places on that local device.  Read the results and if all are deemed <strong>Sane</strong> you should be good to go for re-connecting to the Sync server with the new password. </p><p>Unfortunately, the <strong>Firefox for ...</strong> builds don't have that ""Verify Integrity"" feature for Places. </p>"

Unfortunately I am not a techie and I cannot follow your instructions.  First of all, what page am I supposed to be on when I start?  The main menu when I open Firefox or the one blank page I get when I try to open gmail?  I do not know what a reload button is, and anyway you can only left-click on a mouse, not a button. When I open gmail in Firefox a largely blank page appears with <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/</a>  in the url space at the top and that is as far as it gets.  When I open it in Chrome, the same blank page comes on, but then the red envelope appears and a new page comes on with my Inbox or wherever I left off the last time I was logged on.  The red envelope and new page are not appearing on Firefox.    I have tried to find my Gmail several ways on Firefox;  for example, adding #inbox to the url, but nothing further happens.  All other sites in Firefox are working properly. I am not sure what you mean by ""websites that cause problems"".   Do you mean the gmail site itself, or other websites that may be preventing me from getting onto my gmail?  Hopefully my explanation of what precisely happens will give you other ideas on how this matter could be addressed.  When you reply it is best to assume that I am pretty lousy at figuring out these technical matters and will need very precise instructions. </p> id:1301419,created:2020-03-30 13:55:30 -0800,updated:2020-03-30 13:55:30 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>You can try these steps in case of issues with web pages: </p><p>You can reload web page(s) and bypass the cache to refresh possibly outdated or corrupted files. </p> <ul><li>hold down the Shift key and left-click the Reload button </li><li>press ""Ctrl + F5"" or press ""Ctrl + Shift + R"" (Windows,Linux) </li><li>press ""Command + Shift + R"" (Mac) </li></ul> <p>Clear the Cache and remove the Cookies for websites that cause problems via the ""3-bar"" Firefox menu button (Options/Preferences). </p><p>""Remove the Cookies"" for websites that cause problems: </p> <ul><li>Options/Preferences -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security<br>Cookies and Site Data: ""Manage Data"" </li></ul> <p>""Clear the Cache"": </p> <ul><li>Options/Preferences -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security<br>Cookies and Site Data -&gt; Clear Data -&gt; Cached Web Content: Clear </li></ul> <p>Start Firefox in <u>Safe Mode</u> to check if one of the extensions (""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Extensions) or if <u>hardware acceleration</u> is causing the problem. </p> <ul><li>switch to the DEFAULT theme: ""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Themes </li><li>do NOT click the ""Refresh Firefox"" button on the Safe Mode start window </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems</a> </li></ul> <hr> <p>You can remove all data stored in Firefox for a specific domain via ""Forget About This Site"" in the right-click context menu of an history entry (""History -&gt; Show All History"" or ""View -&gt; Sidebar -&gt; History""). </p><p>Using ""Forget About This Site"" will remove all data stored in Firefox for this domain like history and cookies and passwords and exceptions and cache, so be cautious.

Reopen, started OK, showed Custom settings although all are default except streamlining. </p><p>PrimoPDF appears to have been the source of the JavaScript error, and in Primo the ""streamlining"" option appears to be the root cause. That it happened coming off of Firefox appears to have been happenstance. </p><p>Now the only thing that flashes on the screen looks like an error — but it is not.

Yes, what you've described is totally possible and there are a couple of ways to go about setting this up. </p><p>The way I usually recommend is to make two separate Firefox shortcuts on your desktop. Then, you would need to add the appropriate <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options"" rel=""nofollow"">Command Line Options</a> to the shortcut target. </p><p>On Windows, that's done by right-clicking on the shortcut and selecting <em>Properties</em>. If you click the <em>Shortcut</em> tab of the window that appears, you will see the <em>Target</em> text box that points to Firefox. You would just need to add <code>-new-instance -P ""PROFILE_NAME""</code> to the end of the target <u>outside</u> of the quotation marks. </p><p>The <code>-new-instance</code> allows you to run more than one Firefox profile simultaneously. The <code>-P</code> tells Firefox what profile you want to use. Obviously, you would need to replace the <code>PROFILE_NAME</code> with your profile name (keep the quotations). That can be found on the <code>about:profiles</code> page in Firefox. </p><p>If you set each shortcut to open a different profile, it should work the way that you are hoping for. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1322511,created:2020-06-10 09:38:38 -0800,updated:2020-06-10 09:38:38 -0800,creator:sefridie,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>The profiles solution sounds like it would help me, too.

I have been reading about this but i can't find an answer specific to my question.  I want to change my Firefox account password, not because i forgot it, just because i want a better one.  Online you can read that if you reset the password (without the recovery keys), all data will be lost, but i don't want to reset it. I have access to my settings page and there is no warning in the ""Change Password"" option saying that if you change it, data will be lost.

Others softwares work well.,"<p>Good afternoon! </p><p>After an update has occurred in my Debian 10, Firefox now recognizes only the US English keyboard layout. in short, I can not type anything with accent. My keyboard layout is ""Brazilian Portugueses ABNT 2"" and now I have to go looking for where the necessary keys are. And even finding the location of the keys still can not put the appropriate accents in words. For now, I only detected this problem in Firefox. Constantly, I use GEdit and Libreoffice and both work well. including, so that the text of this situation, I'm posting here, get all cute with sharp words and so on, had to do everything in GEdit, copy and paste here on this site.  </p><p>For if I did not do so could not emphasize the words. I believe the problem is in Firefox, then I downloaded the latest version on the site yesterday (03/27/2020), the 74.0 version, but it doesn't works too. I configured Firefox language to Brazilian Portuguese, but it doesn't work tool.  </p><p>The operating system is all right, because, as mentioned above, the other softwares are seeing the correct layout of the keyboard (Brazilian Portuguese ABNT 2). If anyone has any hint of what might be done to the Firefox pass to see the keyboard layout set in the operating system and can post here, will be of great help. Therefore, I did not want to install another browser.  </p><p>Beforehand, thank you! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-740;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1303516;1303792;1305013;,eddiesaliba,"id:1305013,created:2020-04-12 03:38:58 -0800,updated:2020-04-12 03:38:58 -0800,creator:maurrox,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Same problem after update in Debian 9.

I have saved several thousand bookmarks, and often they are added.  I have 20 folders in the bookmark sidebar.  In each of these main-folders there are 4 - 25 subfolders and in there sub-subfolders etc.  To save new bookmarks I type Ctrl + D, to open the bookmark-saving-window. Than I have to scroll, scroll, open folder, scroll, scroll, open sub-folder, scroll, etc.  </p><p>Imagine, your Windows file manager would only be so small,  you would go crazy.  It would be better, to be able to enlarge the bookmark-saving-window.  Or even bring it to screen size with one click.  This would be a great relief for everyone who frequently saves bookmarks.  And nothing would change for the others.  </p><p>Another point:  I often save several new bookmarks in one folder.  In the bookmark memory, the folder that was used previously, is never displayed. So you have to click again, to show the last used folder.  It would make more sense, always to display the last used folder.  Then you could save the bookmark with 'Enter' and only have to click on if you want a different folder.  </p><p>I'm definitely not the only one who saves many bookmarks.

I recently set this software to boot with OS.  </p><p>What I have noticed is that when, EVGA Precision runs Mozilla Firefox is the only app (games, other browsers and other apps) to experience this weird graphics glitch, this particular glitch is not very evident from the screenshot of Firefox below but if you look closely to the left side of firefox, you would notice that a blue rectangle extends from top to bottom covering up part of the web browser, this is purely isolated to this browser. What is not captured in the screenshot below is that this rectangular block of blue changes color frequently and seems to cycle through each color in the palette. </p><p>Over the past few days, the solution to my problem was to exit EVGA Precision, however this is no longer the case and with that I have no evidence to conclusively say that this is related to EVGA's software. As this seems to be solely isolated to Firefox my belief is that this is indeed firefox. </p><p>Hardware acceleration is enabled on the browser and is set to default ""use recommended performance settings""  </p><p>please note: - Upgrading of Graphics drivers was carried out to the latest as of today, since issue has been ongoing before upgrade and after upgrade, I am ruling out graphics driver as a potential fault </p><p>if someone can assist it would be greatly appreciated </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-740;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nerosnothome,""

It has been momentarily freezing/lagging whenever I view 1080 HD Youtube videos, or whenever I view a graphics intensive site, or sometimes even random close out a tab. And when whenever I view Images in a tab, after the crash happens, some times the grey background behind said image is ALL black and when I zoom in and zoom out, there is still a zoom in image glitch behind the real image when it's zoomed out. </p><p>And now whenever I view a site, namely one that is on a <a href=""http://PJJ.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">PJJ.cc</a> server... A chatroom which I own seems to be glitching on Firefox and not on any other browser as far as I know. On the side panel, is supposed to have a background JPG which is a brick wallpaper, but it's all black... However, when I either shrink the browser, or switch over to another tab and back to that one, it appears loaded in. </p><p>I tried refreshing the browser, that didn't work. I tried uninstalling and doing a clean install... that didn't work either. </p><p>Can someone tell me WHAT is exactly going on and if this can be fixed, or if it will be fixed during the next update? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;windows-81;bug_1;firefox-740;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1300334;1300347;1300349;1300431;1300491;1300556;1300577;1300583;1300697;1300780;1300841;,Yautja_Theide,"id:1300841,created:2020-03-27 18:07:18 -0800,updated:2020-03-27 18:07:18 -0800,creator:Yautja_Theide,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>At this point, I think Update 74.0 is just straight up unstable and full of bugs.

I have done the steps as instructed. And the problem is still very much persisting. I have checked this out on other browsers such as Internet Explorer, and I.E. seems to function just fine when it comes to that particular server. I have yet to check Chrome on a family member's laptop, but I have reason to believe that the problem doesn't extend there either. </p><p>I also checked out Firefox on my laptop, and from what I can see, the problem doesn't persist there either. </p><p>We've ruled out hardware. So... this is clearly a software glitch. One which... I can definitely say I am not happy with and am very annoyed with. </p><p>I don't want to switch over to Chrome because I just do not like that browser but I am strongly considering it at this point. But I rather would not want to download that browser and switch to it... </p><p>Firefox has been very good to me in the years I've had it, but this is just straight up annoying. </p><p>And I think that MemTest somehow affected the browsing speed for my Firefox too... But I can't be too sure about that. </p><p>I am going to check out my other PC to see if this happens on them as well, and determine if this is a server issue and not a Firefox issue once more. </p><p>EDIT: So I checked out my laptop to see if the Firefox browser on that device had the same problem after having downloaded FireFox 74.0, and it actually does in fact have the same problem. So, this is indeed a Firefox issue but I believe this is only HALF of the issue right here. </p><p>A reliable source has informed me that it's also the <a href=""http://PJJ.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">PJJ.cc</a> domain server as well, as it still utilizes JAVA and Firefox no longer supports this.

Is there a way to override this behavior and make Firefox suppress background images the way it did in version 72?  As a low-vision user, I find that the new behavior interferes a lot with the readability of some web pages, and I haven't come across a page yet where the new behavior actually helps me.  Note that I don't want to suppress ALL images, only the background images, the way it works in version 72.

If yours is not at all the same issue, please disregard all of this. </p> id:1300113,created:2020-03-25 07:12:23 -0800,updated:2020-03-25 09:33:35 -0800,creator:gehap51224,updated_by:,is_spam:true,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Firefox Expert </p><p>Thank you For Choosing Firefox Help &amp; Community </p><p>Now Call On Toll Free 1-844-289-4752 For Firefox Support &amp; Help </p> id:1300094,created:2020-03-25 05:55:51 -0800,updated:2020-03-25 05:55:51 -0800,creator:maximilien.chaumon,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I mean this happens repeatedly, right?

There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first).

Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox.

I had 300+ current and old passwords typed out on six pages and didn't want to visit every site again. I needed a way to quickly convert my data file (passwords.xlsx) to be used by Chrome. I was able to figure it out so I'm itemizing it for others. </p><p>Firefox can import passwords from other browsers but not from files. Chrome can import passwords from .cvs files. So this is a two step process. </p><p>Install Chrome and visit a few sites you don't currently have in Firefox to log in and create an initial password data file. Export it to it's generic .cvs file. When you open it you may find that it not only needs site, user name, and password, but also the url of the login page. Thus I had to open up an extra column in my password.xlsx file. </p><p>With the password.xlsx file open in a window on the bottom of the screen and any browser open in the top half the next step is tedious, but much faster than logging into every site. Copy the site name (cxw113) into the address line and let your browser find the site. Click on the login link. Copy and paste the derived url from the browser back to the .cvs file. </p><p>When you have done a few that are different than ones you already have, save the file. Open Chrome and go to Settings &gt; Passwords. You will see three vertical dots on the level with ""Saved Passwords"". Left click on the three vertical dots then RIGHT click on ""Export passwords"" and click on ""Inspect"". This opens a developers panel on the right and will highlight the code for the button you just pressed. As you scroll up it will highlight the previous code section. Click on the word ""hidden"". It will become editable. Delete the word and move back to the password panel. Now when you click on the three vertical dots it gives you the choice to ""import"". Do so and go to the file that you want to import. Even with a different file name than the original it will work. As long as there are no blank or empty cells in the .cvs file Chroome will import them properly. Don't worry. This resets as soon as you close Chrome. </p><p>You must now close Chrome. Open Firefox and go to the three bars to the far right on the address bar. Click and go down to ""Logins and Passwords"". Click on the three horizontal dots in the far upper right and select ""Import Passwords"".  Follow the dialogue for Chrome and Passwords. Check and you'll find the test passwords you did with the first few are now in Firefox. </p> id:1300047,created:2020-03-24 21:58:06 -0800,updated:2020-03-24 21:58:06 -0800,creator:robertjohnfletcher,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi all </p><p>Thanks for all the responses, the workaround I finally did was to borrow a mates laptop that had windows, created a new user.

Then anything is possible, I suppose. Not all COOKIES, are the DELICIOUS KINDS. And I'm one who rarely cleans out the cookie bin, because so many sites, such as Amazon, WalMart, Best Buy, Target, etc., places cookies to ID who you are, so it prevents having to login to the sites. But again, that's me. </p><p>Saying I bought my first computer in June, soon to be 26 years ago, doesn't prove I have that much expert knowledge on all of it. But I'm on my 8th pc,, and if the covid-19 virus skips over me, there'll be a number 9 in a year or so. I've tried out different browsers over the years, like Opera, Safari and others. And I really don't remember a Gmail Inbox page, like this in FireFox. But now it's KOSHER AGAIN, and it seems more normal to me. You seem to have good knowledge on FireFox, but may I ask if you have any experience using Mozilla's TOR browser? I came across it a few years back, and to be honest about it, I really like it..., a lot. That's not because I travel in the DEEP WEB, but because of it's attempt at securing our online identity. My computer was hacked into and had control taken away from me some years back. I had to pay some money, to get it released back to me. After it was, I filed a complaint with the FTC, over what had happened and the money I had to put up, and also filed an IDENTITY THEFT claim against them, because of so much info they could have ripped off the pc. About two years later, even though I felt the FTC couldn't do much about it, I got a letter from them, and inside was an explanation of what they had accomplished against these hackers, and a check that not only covered the money they took off of me, but another added amount, that doubled what they had taken from me. That added amount, was a bonus to me, from what the FTC had charged the group with, so I got my money back, that was actually doubled from the fine the hackers had to pay off. I never found my ID had been used for something, which was good, and it led me to purchase a VPN, that I now use to try and secure myself and my ID. You never know, what trouble may head your way from some illegal actions against you, so with the VPN, the ID you see, is not the ID of who I really am. But Tor is really a neat concept, and I may, as I said, MAY one day try and venture in the deep web, but if I sdo that, just what may occur, is unknown. So, we'll see. </p><p>Again, it was nice of you to help me, and I hope that we all escape the CHINESE PANDEMIC. Can't help wonder, if Russia has so many millions of people under control, why the WHO shows they have but 149 confirmed cases of Covid-19? Makes me wonder, if it may be possible, that the virus, may be MAN-MADE.

I'm too accustomed to choosing what to do with each email - delete it, spam it, save it under some lable, or any other decision I can make, with each one.

I have used mostly Chrome for years, and have had a little use with Firefox. I don't need to say just how different Chrome and Firefox is, add Safari, and Internet Explorer, which I personally wish had NEVER been made, and there are some things different in them from each other. The Image I attached, is my Gmail page viewed in Firefox. Maybe I should know better, but Gmail in Chrome, certainly looks different than it does in Firefox, On the left side of each, you have Inbox and all the labels you choose to have, and to show, that you have for various areas of interest to you. That, is not what I was asking about, because that I understand. Look at the photo, and you'll see in the center part of the page, THREE CATEGORIES, that email's are sent to from Inbox. Primary, Updates, and Forum. This is what I need help with. If I had a choice, and perhaps I don't realize that I do have it, I'd trade this page view of Gmail in Firefox, for the view I have of Gmail in Chrome. But my desire as is now, is to remove the category named FORUM, and either replace it with something more useful for me, or simply leave just Primary and Updates, as the only two that are shown and used. Again, I aplogize if I wasn't clear enough, and perhaps confused some over what I was trying to establish. Thank you for your assistance, and again, I thank you for any more you may have. God Bless.

When you run an older version of Firefox, if there's no profile matching that version, Firefox will create a new one. </p><p>You can migrate your bookmarks using one of the automatic backups.

I've looked up a few fixes before posting and they didn't work: </p><p>- Tried booting FF on safe mode and it didn't fix the issue - it clearly isn't caused by an add-on (and I've never had this issue in my previous browser with nearly the same add-ons installed). - other people seem to have had the exact same issue multiple times and it's lasted for years, so it's clearly a problem on FF's end. </p><p>Here is the issue described more specifically: Copying things from a tab from FF and into the online version of Word does not work - when I try to, the intended selection:  - disappears a few seconds after I've pasted - or it does not appear at all - or when it does, it erases the entire sentence it was pasted next to it, which you can imagine is absolutely bothersome. </p><p>I've also tried to copy/paste statistics from a site called <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org"" rel=""nofollow"">archiveofourown.org</a> onto another FF tab. - What ended up being copied is only the last character of the entire content I was trying to paste, which I think suggests there's some issue with what's contained in the clipboard. </p><p>I'm mentioning these two websites because I'm guessing that something about them is probably conflicting with the copy/paste feature, however I'm hoping no one will have the gall to tell me it's those websites' faults and that I should just stop using them. </p><p>When pasting (while having hopefully copied the former selected content- and no, it wasn't the case), it always pastes the content which was last copied into the clipboard prior to that very attempt, which shows that the clipboard's content was not refreshed with the last selected copied one. </p><p>I'm surprised to see that FF has had such a glaring issue for years and for many other users, and updates have never given a fix for it. I'd like this issue to be fixed properly, because I'd hate to have to switch back to my previous browser. FF sports so many nice features that other browsers don't have, and it'd be a shame to ruin the experience with a bug so basic as the copy/paste feature being broken. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;probablynotafirefoxproblem;office365;firefox-740;copyandpaste;copyandpaste74;word;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1299677;1299705;1308168;1308249;1329077;1338652;1338976;1339319;,yumiifmb,"id:1339319,created:2020-08-06 08:13:36 -0800,updated:2020-08-06 08:13:36 -0800,creator:chadliszt,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This issue just started on my MacBook (OS 10.15.6)- maybe with the latest software update (79.0 installed on 7/31).

In my Privacy &amp; Security tab, I am using custom settings and do not have the box checked to block any cookies. In Manage Permissions for cookies I also have always explicitly allowed cookies from my school's portal and <a href=""http://duosecurity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duosecurity.com</a>.

I've gone as far to reinstall the browser completely, but this hasn't worked either? Does anyone else have this problem or have any other tips?

It's poor practice to set a fixed width when printing, since it limits how the browser is able to adapt your content to fit the page. It should be <code>width: 100%;</code> instead. </p><p>This issue is coupled with the fact that the print rules for the <code>.Main</code> element is not removing the padding from the left and right of the page content. This would be done by adding <code>padding:0;</code> to the rule. </p><p>Essentially, because you have set the content to be 7.5 inches wide with 1 inch on either side, the document is 9.5 inches wide. Setting the printing scale to 100% means that trying to print on paper less than 9.5 inches wide is going to cause content on the right side to overflow off of the page. </p><p>The reason you are seeing a lot of whitespace on the <strong>Fit to page</strong> option is because Firefox is still trying to print the 1 inch padding on either side of the content. So you are printing an extra 1 inch of space on either side, plus whatever margins your printer has set. </p><p>So your CSS rules for the print media query needs to be: </p> <pre>.Main {     width: 100%;     padding: 0; }</pre> <p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Why ?,"<p>Resume :  </p><p>All info (password, historic, favorites, everything) stored on a new sync account was lost.  </p><p>Before the problem :  </p><p>I made the new account, syncronized it with my current cookies, once saved i formated the pc. THen logged and did a syncronization on the new distro's firefox, and everything (cookies) was loaded perfectly. That was months ago. The account remained logged this whole time. </p><p>( account maded on ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, and logged on lubuntu 19.04) </p><p>Problem : </p><p>Now i re-made this whole process (formating the pc and loggin on this same sync) , but this time there was no data at all. Was like a new account. Maybe even worse, because a new account should have at least one historic page. But this account's historic was  totally erased.  Even if the account was not syncronizing and saving my cookies after i've logged on the new distro, it did saved the cookies from the old distro, so at least these cookies  should be there. </p><p>(account loaded on lubuntu 19.10) </p><p>After the problem : </p><p>After the loss of its data, the blank sync account have beeing sucefully sycronizing (loading and saving) new cookies, but never the old ones.  </p><p>What i tried : </p><p>Re-syncronized. Re-logged on other devices (android and linux). re-installed firefox. Redifined the password.  </p><p>Why its unlikly i made a mistake : </p><p>I'm a old user of firefox sync (in other accounts) on a live-linux distro, so i'm constantly loggin into my other Sync account and syncronizing my data.  And never i had a problem were i losed my saved historic/favorites/passwords. Anything. So is very unlikely that i made a mistake ... I even have old confirmation emails, proving the account was created on a device, and then logged on a new device, wich required a confirmation password. </p><p>My conclusion : A sync Account was created, cookies were saved into it, then they were deleted and the browser  stopped saving new cookies on the account. I didn't realized because the cookies were alredy stored on my local drive. When i made a new logging, the browser started to save cookies again, and those weren't remains, because they weren't deleted.  </p><p>Could it be that firefox's servers had a malfunction and my data were lost ?

I want to have all NEW website tabs not stacked on top of each other.  Presently, I have to 'X' out of each open tab that is in a stack to get to the one buried to the one I want below.  I also do not want to hover over the FF icon on taskbar to display all open windows/tabs (that I can barely make out) to try to find what I am looking for .   </p><p>I can't get each new link/tab to open next to the one to the left. I want the tabs to look like first photo.  All the tabs -websites are stacked on top of each other to the far right (second photo).  I want  my FF pages/tabs to properly look like the first screen shot on left (this shot is from my laptop....issue is with desktop computer), and not the screen shot on right that shows one tab/windows but has several more websites/tabs under it.   </p><p>I do not have any tab extensions installed and all my tab options are unchecked in Options.  I think this issue is somewhere in the preferences (about:config).  No clue where.. </p><p>Also, is there a way to have all newly open tabs open first on the far LEFT rather the far right. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Steven </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-740;,firefox,other,en-US,1299011;1299017;1299077;1299078;1299079;1299086;1299090;1299092;1299111;1299158;1299160;1299167;1299177;1299185;1299196;1299204;1299208;1299209;1299210;1299214;1299216;1299217;1299218;1299226;1299232;1299243;1299302;1299303;1299308;1299311;1299312;1299314;1299315;1299316;1299320;1299321;1299322;1299325;1299326;1299328;1299330;1299331;1299333;1299334;1299337;1299341;1299350;1299352;1299368;1299463;,StevenLAX16,"id:1299463,created:2020-03-22 12:42:22 -0800,updated:2020-03-22 12:42:22 -0800,creator:StevenLAX16,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>McCoy <a href=""#answer-1299368"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> You've got to be kidding !

If it's possible to re-enable it via something in <code>about:config</code>, I'd be satisfied. Please don't repeat yourself @cor-el if you don't understand my point. You are wasting your time. </p> id:1299340,created:2020-03-22 03:10:32 -0800,updated:2020-03-22 03:10:32 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Did you already placed a checkmark in the ""Show editor when saving"" at the bottom of the dialog that opens if you click the star ? </p><p>This item is at the bottom just above ""Remove Bookmark"" and ""Done"". </p><p>See ""How do I change the name or location of a bookmark?"" </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox</a> </li></ul> <hr> <p>If you want to hide the extra content at the top of the dialog then you need to use code in userChrome.css. </p> <pre>/* BOOKMARK EDIT - InfoArea */ *|div#editBookmarkPanelInfoArea { display:none !important; }</pre> <hr> <p>It is not that difficult to create userChrome.css if you have never used it. </p><p>The first step is to open the ""Help -&gt; Troubleshooting Information"" page and find the button to access the profile folder. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-troubleshooting-information-page-fix-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-troubleshooting-information-page-fix-firefox</a> </li></ul> <p>You can find this button under the ""Application Basics"" section as ""Profile Folder -&gt; Open Folder"".

This is directed to Firefox as an organization. I DEPEND on Firefox. I have 90 - 100 tabs open in multiple accounts, I bought into ""if it doesn't run in the browser"" - I don't want it. Last week, Firefox stopped loading Gmail. Not Gmail Contacts or Calendar - just Gmail. But Gmail worked in if opened in a private window, After much anguish for days, I learned that Right Clicking on a working web page (in the Private Window) allowed me to delete Cache and Cookies FOR JUST GOOGLE. I did it and signed in and whuddaya know, Gmail works again. OK - a blip in the force. Now Slack doesn't work. Exact same symptoms - just non responsive to <a href=""http://slack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">slack.com</a>. Ah Ha I said. Firefox 74 is NFG. Let's just reinstall 73. Ooooh - the miracle minds at Firefox NO LONGER ALLOW DOWNGRADING - BECAUSE (wait for it) - ""most of these problems are not due to an upgrade"". Really? Most? This is not about being polite. This is about allowing a user to revert to a working version when a problem hits. Firefox is losing market share and if you want to know why. Well - here it is. It's unreliable. BTW: I was able to revert Gmail because I had other tabs signed in. I only have 1 Slack tab. I tried using the Private Window tab - nope. I USE Firefox to (1) make my life easier and (2) be more productive than my cohorts. Fail on 1 of those: not good. Fail on both: hello Chrome or any other browser that just works. P.S. I've been using Firefox for...hmmm I'm 70 and its unlikely there was a whole decimal digit in front of my starting version.

Sorry I don't have an account with ""appropriate permissions""! I'll tell you one thing: if you don't fix it soon, I'll be using a different browser. </p><p>Almost every time I go away from my system for an hour or so, when I come back, Firefox has consumed so much memory that my memory is about 95% full (from initially being 65% or less full). My system is so unresponsive that it sometimes takes up to a minute just to run the Task Manager to kill the offending Firefox process. It's always one process among eleven or so other Firefox processes (I keep quite a few windows and tabs open). Killing that process often mostly solves the memory problem for several hours.  It does, however, create several other problems. First, it nearly always causes one or more tabs to crash. They can usually be restarted by clicking the Restart Tab(s) button on the page that replaces a crashed tab. Sometimes, though, one of the Firefox windows quits responding entirely, or more often, a Twitter page can no longer update. In those cases, I have to restart Firefox. </p><p>What seems odd is that the problem appears to happen more when my system is idle than when I'm using it, and actively browsing. Though I suppose that could just be my imagination. What I do know is that the excess memory consumption occurs even if all the Firefox windows are minimized. Why does a minimized window need to allocate great quantities of memory in a relatively short time? </p><p>This bug wouldn't be a big problem if it didn't happen so often. I've had Firefox memory usage problems in the past, but never anything that occurred with the regularity of the current bug. It's been going on for quite a long time; there's been plenty of time to fix it. </p> id:1307652,created:2020-04-21 18:57:56 -0800,updated:2020-04-21 18:57:56 -0800,creator:simpsonadvisors,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Firefox is taking almost 600K of physical memory. </p> id:1298752,created:2020-03-19 13:39:51 -0800,updated:2020-03-19 13:39:51 -0800,creator:evhenry,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This is a known bug we are working on resolving. it is being discussed here <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608725"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608725</a> </p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience at the moment. </p>"

Easiest to do the sorting is via the right-click context menu in the left panel in the Library where all the folder are displayed. In the right panel in the Library sorting can be done if you right-click a folder name in this panel, but for the main (root) bookmarks folders like Bookmarks Menu and Bookmarks Toolbar folder the only option is via the left panel. </p><p>Remember that ""Sort By Name"" is only available in the right-click context menu of a folder name and not for an individual bookmark.

Additional windows contain other secondary clusters of pending projects. When trying to rearrange my work (=tabs), dragging a tab with the mouse across 50 other tabs is quite cumbersome and difficult to find the right place to sort it into. I'm looking for an easy way, like in Powerpoints slide-sorter where you can see 50+ slides in a matrix grid layout, or in the Mac OS Finder, where you can see thumbnail pictures and rearrange them. Mouse-dragging is great and much appreciated, but has its limits when dragging the tab ""far"" across the tabs to a new location many tabs away. Solutions would be most appreciated. Thanks.

With Firefox, only the first is registered while it loads the previous page. Then I can do it again but it's only registered once, again, and so on. So a quick 'click-click-click' should take me back three places in the active tab's history. In Firefox, clicks after the first are ignored until it's gone back and loaded that page.

More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop</a> (before Firefox 70: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>). </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

Some lovely NL person, I suspect! </p><p>As for the actual issue raised in that thread, I have mixed feelings… (This is my humble perspective as a question-asker.) </p><p>I don't like systems which encourage showing off, arrogance, a mentality of ""I'm the best"", competition, leaderboards, and the associated stress of users worrying about their ranking. Systems involving badges and medals seem geared toward creating this kind of environment. </p><p>On the other hand, I don't have a problem with mere statistics being given, like number of answers/solutions. That is very helpful information. </p><p>Technically, the ""Top 25 Contributor"" status is just a statistic, and it's useful to know if the person you're speaking to is a prolific contributor, because you can generally trust his/her answer to be backed by some degree of expertise and experience. I think it's only right that such people have a status/flag to designate that they are committed to regular contribution on the forum. </p><p>Having said that, I do have three problems with ""Top 25 Contributor"" statuses: </p><p>1. Presentation style If it looks like some kind of 'badge of honor' for showing off then that is a problem. The current ALL CAPS styling seems a bit showy. </p><p>2. Ambiguous meaning When I see the words ""Top 25 Contributor"" I automatically assume this is based on some kind of rating of quality. But I now know that it's just based on the number of contributions, which isn't what ""top"" means to me. </p><p>3. Too many categories My third and final problem is that you have two different categories: ""Top 25"" and a ""Top 10"". (Perhaps others?) These categories carry a false sense of rank, with the implication that one is ""better"" than the other, when in fact any prolific contributor is equally worthy. </p><p>Taking all the above into account, if it were up to me, I would ditch ""Top 25"" and ""Top 10 Contributor"" and create a single status for all prolific/regular contributors. I would use lower-case and make it a friendly colour such as green. </p> id:1298303,created:2020-03-17 10:43:15 -0800,updated:2020-03-17 10:43:15 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>MartyJames <a href=""#answer-1298299"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Indeed!

Peculiarly, addresses that ARE stored in my favorites, do not appear first in the suggested domain names. Okay, I’ve done my homework! </p><p>My conclusion/question: Some (former) favorites are stored in a location that I have no access to. I would like to receive suggestions as to where I can find these.

The suggestions appear to be totally random. If the most recently or most frequently visited favorites would appear first, that would make sense. Or if the main page would appear first (<a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>) and not any other subpages. Does anyone know if this is possible and then, how to achieve this? </p><p>Lastly: I don’t understand why a browser that claims to be so concerned about my privacy allows for so many unwanted options. Also, it is a nuisance if these options are actually reset with every update Firefox installs. I have the impression that this happens. I did notice that now and then additional search engines are added to my one-click-search engines (about:preferences#search) without my prior notification.

Any ideas?","<p>So I have been Firefox Developer Edition on three different devices for the past year and just a few days ago on one of my devices, Firefox would not keep my theme settings, extensions, or accept my master password, so I closed Firefox. But that didn't help and since i needed to reboot my system anyway, I did a reboot and when I logged back on and tried to open Firefox it gave me an XUL Runner error saying that 75.0 is not compatible with min version &gt;=74.0. So I uninstalled FDE and then re-downloaded it, reinstalled 75.0 since I do believe that the update to 75.0 had hung up on this particular device a week before. So then a day later my other two devices started having issues, so I tried to sign into another Firefox account, that didn't work so I did a reinstall and it seemed fine for a minute until I realized all my passwords/logins/history were gone, so I tried to sync again and then it gave me the message to set my master password, so I tried and kept getting the 'Cannot change master password' error. I have reinstalled twice and create a new Firefox account, tried to sign into an older one. I know someone will say just use the regular Firefox, but I use the FDE because my other Firefox browser is set with a work account that I keep to backup user data at work and I cannot use for my personal device.  Any ideas? </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-750;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1298439;1298540;,nights.in.hell.nih,"id:1298540,created:2020-03-18 11:35:09 -0800,updated:2020-03-18 11:35:09 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>When you are using Firefox Sync it is best to disable Sync on at least the device where you are having this problem before attempting to fix anything.

When I follow the link to unsubscribe, I'm prompted to log into my account. When I log in, I'm prompted to confirm my account via a verification link sent via email. However, that email to my iCloud account never arrives. I've tried repeatedly to have it resent without success. I've had a case escalated via Apple support up to their engineering department, and they say the email isn't getting filtered by them but in fact never reaches their servers, so there's nothing they can do. So now I'm stuck on this mailing list because I can't access my account. Blocking me from leaving the list seems illegal per the CAN-SPAM act. Even being able to log in here seems short-lived, since it appears that tomorrow (16 March) my Mozilla support account will be merged into that same Firefox account that I can't access. Unbelievable, really. </p><p>The irony isn't lost on me: I can't stop getting email from Firefox because I'm not getting the verification email from Firefox. I see the dark humor, but this is a problem that needs to be resolved. I don't know where else to turn for help, so hoping someone here can provide some guidance. The real ask here is not to just get off the mailing list (I could set up a filter to automatically delete it, though I shouldn't have to do that) but instead to be able to receive the email to verify my account or, barring that, get help changing the email address on the existing account to one that can actually receive the email, e.g. my Gmail account. </p>",desktop;other;escalate;,firefox,other,en-US,1297840;1297841;1297851;1297856;1297889;1297898;1297971;,brossow,"id:1297971,created:2020-03-16 01:48:03 -0800,updated:2020-03-16 01:48:03 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em><strong>(Would still love info on that, since it seems I won't even be able to post in this forum after tomorrow when the accounts are merged, and I'm not going to create a new account just for Firefox.)</strong></em> </p><p>The deadline for using a Firefox Account (FxA) for login to this forum has been pushed back to Mar 23.  </p><p><em>I had a problem last week with the ""merge"" of the account for here and an existing FxA, which I was able to solve, which when I discovered that date was pushed forward a week.</em> </p> id:1297898,created:2020-03-15 15:17:30 -0800,updated:2020-03-15 16:01:40 -0800,creator:brossow,updated_by:brossow,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1297889"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> See also: <ul><li><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/newsletter/recovery/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/newsletter/recovery/</a> </li></ul> </blockquote> <p>That did it for unsubscribing from the newsletter(s).

Try it after each action to see whether it is available yet. </p><p>(1) Large alert dialog (lots of text) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, it may reappear. After two or three appearances, Firefox should add a checkbox at the bottom of the dialog to stop the site from showing more alerts. Check that box and click OK to block further dialogs. </p><p>(2) Authentication dialog (asks for username and password) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, the page may reload and immediately show it again. Pressing the Esc key numerous times in a row can cancel the reload as well as the dialog. </p><p>(3) Reacting to mouse movement </p><p>Some pages have a script that detects when you are moving the mouse pointer up toward the tab bar and takes action to show another dialog, or moves to full screen view to hide the toolbar area. On these pages, the keyboard shortcut is essential. </p><p>Hopefully this will let you close problem pages without having to ""kill"" Firefox in the Windows Task Manager.

It makes text on focused matches invisible.  </p><p>Don't try using something like yellow BG &amp; red FG for focused match colors (or any high contrast, high visibility duo) - it won't allow it.

1282027,2020-03-14 16:21:18 -0800,2020-05-08T21:49:20Z,A Firefox update disabled/killed the Firefox on my Desktop... Twice.,"<p>I'm fed up with the lack of support from Firefox. This issue has been going on for three weeks. The last Firefox update crashed TWICE! When I opened a Google/Firefox, An Update window popped up. Since I normally let them download or whatever they do, I wasn't concerned. Then it showed an ""Error"". I didn't see an ""Error Code Number or Name"" as it disappeared quickly. I tried to open Firefox/Google. To my surprise, all I got was a Blank Window. I tried clicking on the ""Home Icon"". Nothing changed. I tried my Bookmarks. No affect. I WAS Signed In. I tried finding the Fictional ""Firefox Support"". I got nowhere. I would've Googled the issue, but I couldn't even use that. Nothing Worked. I finely decided to download a NEW Firefox/Google. Once I did, it worked fine all day.  The next day, I opened the newly Downloaded one. Again I was greeted by the Firefox ""Update"" It started, then showed an Error.  Again, I tried to open Firefox/Google. I got the same blank page as before. I decided to Remove, ALL Firefox/Google. from my Computer. Then I download another New Firefox. I made ONE change. I stopped Firefox from Updating Automatically.  Day three, I opened Firefox, I opened  normally... Almost. Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. If I let it Download, it may Crash again. I lost ALL of my Bookmarks too. I went to the Recommended Firefox Site to retrieve them... It was a LIE! Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. I have NEVER missed an Update  Let me guess what Firefox is going to say. That is IF they reply at all; No one else reported this issue. ( And I have Ocean front property in Arizona). Make sure your operating system is up to date.  (I must be too stupid to keep my system up and maintain this Machine). I should upgrade to the (The Digital Pile of...... that goes by the name) Windows 10, and (The Garbage called) Google Chrome. (Why would I Downgrade to one System that didn't work when it was released, a Browser that was Garbage when it was offered the first time (In 2008), and they WON'T Fix? I'd be better off taking a hammer to my PC. and my own head). </p><pre>Just a quick note. When I first signed up for Google (Prior to the 2008 Google Chrome fiasco.) my Gmail stopped working. I could receive Mail, but I couldn't Open, Read, Delete, or anything else. This lasted for Five Years. I tried getting Help. I never got a reply from anyone. Then it started working. No explanation from Google.  </pre> <p>Don't bother telling me ""Well... It is Free"".  It isn't. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;unclearquestion;firefox-740;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1297668;1297672;1297686;1297697;1297783;1297846;1302715;1302858;1302925;1304070;1304090;1304129;1304138;1304549;1304589;1304603;1304607;1304713;1311231;1311243;1311284;1311303;1311357;1311366;1311381;1311386;1311397;1311425;1311463;,kingofnicepeople,"id:1311463,created:2020-05-08 21:49:20 -0800,updated:2020-05-08 21:49:20 -0800,creator:kingofnicepeople,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I don't understand a word of what you wrote.

Rather than having a separate profile with separate bookmarks, it's all in the same profile. And of course the Facebook Container would also prevent you from accidentally logging into the wrong profile. </p><p>The only other notable thing that I can think of is that the Facebook Container also isolates certain Facebook development features on other websites (like embedded like buttons or embedded comments or a ""login with Facebook"" button). But that doesn't really make a huge difference, since you aren't logged into your Facebook account on the profile that you use for your regular browsing. </p>"

I also had issues logging in to the support forum as well, giving me some kind of error, which I forgot to save, before I hit the refresh button. After I hit the refresh button, I was returned to my account page, and was logged in, strangely enough. Then I came back to this thread, and it allowed me to enter in my comments. I was able to go to the add-ons from inside my menu in Firefox, and searched for Facebook Container, and then attempt to relogin that way, and succeeded, however, it acted like I had to recreate a new profile to do it, as it listed me as a number for the user, until I changed my display name. However the link to add the container, after logging in, is missing, so I could not add the add-on. Upon going back to the Facebook Container page, it looks as though it's already installed, and may be the reason why I couldn't find the button to add it. </p> id:1302375,created:2020-04-03 11:32:35 -0800,updated:2020-04-03 11:32:35 -0800,creator:jklrm,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I get the same message as Kesra.

It was not the first time I encountered this problem, as it had been happening at irregular intervals, and found that it was caused by firefox replacing the ""cookies.sqlite"" file in my profile folder with a new one, while also dubbing the old one ""cookies.sqlite.bak"". I always resolved the problem by: </p><p>-Closing Firefox </p><p>-Deleting the recently created ""cookies.sqlite"" in my profile folder </p><p>-Renaming ""cookies.sqlite.bak"" into ""cookies.sqlite"" </p><p>-(Usually) Creating a copy of the .bak file and keeping it in a folder as insurance, in case I found no recent .bak the next time it happened or it got corrupted somehow </p><p>After doing this, upon starting firefox I would find all my cookies in place and myself logged in all sites I cared about (I set it up so that firefox restores a long-running, multi-windowed session at startup). </p><p>On a side note, I was always able to know whether my ""cookies.sqlite"" file had been rewritten by checking its size: if it had been just created, it would always be 512 Kb; the backup .bak file is instead 1.50 Mb. </p><p><br> Onto the problem at hand: after updating to 74.0 and finding that I lost all cookies and logins, I repeated the process highlighted above, as usual.  It didn't resolve the problem though: I still didn't recover any cookie even though I switched the ""good"" .bak file with the newly created ""cookies.sqlite"". Upon starting firefox, instead of loading my 1.50 Mb .sqlite it keeps immediately renaming it .bak and creating its own cookies.sqlite.  I even tried using a slightly older .bak, one that I had successfully switched before: the result was the same. </p><p>I am at my wits' end: I checked and tried various cookie and privacy settings, but since firefox updated it seems determined to shun my old cookie backup in favor of creating its own empty, useless file. There also doesn't seem to be any recent documentation on this problem I can find. I even considered opening and checking both .sqlite and .bak files for any obvious differences, but I'm afraid I just don't know how. </p><p><br> Those cookies are critical for my navigation.

This tends to happen when server admins modify the list of permitted protocols and ciphers with the goal of removing insecure ones, but don't make sure that at least one cipher is supported by Firefox.

(With a public server, a test page like <a href=""https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/</a> can query the server and list out the supported ciphers and test connectivity of different browsers.) </p> id:1297037,created:2020-03-12 10:49:51 -0800,updated:2020-03-12 10:49:51 -0800,creator:roedel,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>jscher, </p><p>I created the url without the S and got the message that I needed to us the S </p><p>Then I created the Mar2020 new profile and tried the url and got the same error message and no Advanced to be able to add and exception. </p><p>CWR </p> id:1297014,created:2020-03-12 09:52:15 -0800,updated:2020-03-12 09:52:15 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Will your Firefox let you try non-secured access to the site: </p><p>http://192.168.0.253:10000/ </p><p>If that doesn't immediately upgrade to HTTPS, do you get an error message for that address, too? </p> <hr> <p><em>Could you try:</em> </p><p><strong>New Profile Test</strong> </p><p>This takes about 3 minutes, plus the time to test your problem site(s). </p><p>Inside Firefox, type or paste <strong>about:profiles</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it.  </p><p>Click the ""Create a New Profile"" button, then click Next.

Again closed both.   But I’ve now tried multiple times opening from a shortcut to a particular url, and then things work fine – i.e. links and shortcuts open in same instance with no “ff running” or profile manager (so far, at least).  But opening from start menu or an icon created from start menu creates an instance that (a) thinks ff is not default and (b) is ignored when links are clicked.  I’m willing to just open it through a shortcut to a url, even if a bit kludgy, if it continues to keep the problem away.  On the other hand, if this strange behavior suggests a clean solution to you, great.  If not, I’ll live with this kludge (but let you know if problems arise, since earlier things seemed semi-solved, but only for a bit).  In either event, I REALLY appreciate the time you have been taking to help me.   (One more non-development; since the main icon seemed weird I closed ff, changed name of the new ini files, opened through a shortcut to a url to see if it would ask anything re ini files – it didn’t – and things are the same as just reported, i.e. opening through said shortcut seems to work, while opening through start menu creates an instance that is ignored when clicking on links.) </p> id:1297816,created:2020-03-15 09:10:25 -0800,updated:2020-03-15 09:10:25 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Let's remove two settings files and let Firefox regenerate them and see whether we can get things working normally again. </p><p>First, please set Windows to show all file extensions: <a href=""https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-show-file-extensions-in-windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-show-file-extensions-in-windows/</a> </p><p>Next, use this shortcut path to access the Firefox folder -- you can paste this into the Windows 10 search box on the Taskbar (or into the Windows Run dialog) and execute it there.

All I want (recognizing this isn't like being poor, but still) is to be able to click on links and have them open in a new tab, rather than having to copy them to the address bar (which isn't always possible, with some links- you see only a button, not the link).   </p><p>So if there is anything you can do to help me, perhaps some way to wipe everything and start like a new user (but still being able to sign in to my ff account, so I can share across devices) I would SO appreciateit. </p> id:1297362,created:2020-03-13 13:39:14 -0800,updated:2020-03-13 13:39:14 -0800,creator:zarky1,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Here's what happened.  I clicked the Restart normally button.  I then clicked on a link.  Nothing happened with several links (nothing, not ff running or the link opening or anything).  I restarted ff and got the choice of profiles.  I chose my old default.  Now, when I click on a link, it doesn't open the tab, I don't get the ff running message, instead, it tries to open a new instance and I get the profile manager again.  Auuggghhh!!!  I really need to be able to click on links.  I'm perfectly willing to start totally afresh, if there's a way to do that, and reinstall all pwds etc; that will be less work than what I'm going through (and I do appreciate all you're going through with me).  So then I clicked on a link, used profile manager to open the new profile, clicked on another link and it successfully opened in the new one.   So then I tried using profile manager to tell the new profile to load w/o asking.  Then clicking on a link got me the ff running message.   So I accessed profile manager with the –p switch and unchecked that.  Now things seem to be working.  I’ll just manually chose the new profile and add back in all my passwords etc. and hope for the best. So unless you have other suggestions, thanks very much for your help. </p> id:1297335,created:2020-03-13 12:40:54 -0800,updated:2020-03-13 12:40:54 -0800,creator:AliceWyman,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>zarky1 <a href=""#question-1281837"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I used to have two profiles.

There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

These are: </p><p><a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> Bing DuckDuckGo ebay Google Twitter Wikipedia </p><p>and for various reasons, I would like to remove ALL of them, and add one, maybe two or three, default search engines of my own choosing and not have to worry about any of the above defaults showing up in an updated or new release of Firefox, EVER. </p><p>For privacy considerations alone, I figure it makes sense to not trust the seven organizations behind those search engines by default.  If I want to search eBay, I can visit that site, but I stopped having anything to do with eBay years ago.  Companies or organizations such as <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>, Google, Twitter and Wikipedia, sell/provide goods and (information) services I USE OFTEN, but at least three of those four are notoriously nosy (read: they do not respect users' privacy) and the other is not all that organized to begin with, so as much as I like and find Wikipedia useful at maybe once a day (?), I would rather open a new window to search it. </p><p>Bing is not something I use except as a last resort when I am trying to find a mainstream search engine which might not be as biased in some way as the most well-known search engine is.  Google Search is often the foundation for other search tools which attempt to make it more respectful of privacy, run faster, etc.  I like DuckDuckGo but it drops all the timestamp information related to the hits it returns, which makes it less than helpful when I want to skim through results looking for those from a certain time frame. </p><p>I actually use Twitter now that it seems to be POTUS' means of choice for communicating directly with the People of the United States of America (and most of the rest of the world, if one is realistic), when he does not want waste a lot of time and effort to make a comment at a formal or even impromptu press conference.  </p><p>The problem I keep having is that after I have tried various means of removing (almost) all of the default search engines in Firefox, and maybe adding a couple of specialized ones that are typically metasearch providers. Within a matter of weeks, all of the Mozilla standard default search engines show up again. </p><p>Besides that major problem, the issue of not having a simple, straightforward way to create new search engine add-ons of my own means it is difficult to, for example, create several custom Google Searches which have different focuses and thus may be much more efficient for specialized purposes; looking for recent news about a particular pandemic but excluding all but a few sources and restricting the results to a narrow time frame. </p> id:1297184,created:2020-03-13 02:00:35 -0800,updated:2020-03-13 02:00:35 -0800,creator:Standard8,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>If this happens again, please could you let us know the name of the of the other engines that appear.

Can it be disabled?,"<p>Hi, </p><p>I like to work with side-by-side Firefox windows, with one of the windows being far slimmer (horizontally) than the other. Since I updated to Firefox 74.0 today, I can't resize the windows as I like to do. I can resize them, but it's like there's a minimum fixed size to what I can resize it to and then it locks and doesn't go any slimmer from there (maybe so the browser controls don't overlap?). That fixed size is far too big for my use case, i.e. I absolutely need it slimmer. I'm not entirely sure if the previous Firefox version contained a fixed minimum size, but if it did, it was much smaller (it allowed controls to overlap, which wasn't a problem for me) </p><p>Is there a setting that I can change in Firefox 74 so that I can make the windows as slim as I require again? </p>",desktop;customize;needsinfo;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;pixelwidth;pixelwidth74;,firefox,customize,en-US,1296574;1296600;1296621;1296919;1297233;1297236;1297245;1297440;1307380;1307391;1307404;1307407;1307414;1307482;1307654;1307663;,edys.email,"id:1307663,created:2020-04-21 19:57:00 -0800,updated:2020-04-21 19:57:00 -0800,creator:dulope,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I'm a Mozilla fan and loyal user but sadly not a programmer or software engineer - I've had to begin the migration of bookmarks and sites to the Brand 'X' browser - Been with Mozilla for over 10 years and it's a heart breaker but the new minimum window size is a deal breaker - I leave with fond memories ............ </p> id:1307654,created:2020-04-21 19:13:16 -0800,updated:2020-04-21 19:13:16 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>The link you posted is not an official guide for current Firefox releases as that is a link to a page that was archived a long time ago and that doesn't apply to current versions.

I need a program running in a window to the side that requires me to keep an eye on images/text as they flash by, and click a button as appropriate. I do need it to be NARROW, and for some reason, Firefox have started preventing me from making the window as narrow as I need it to be.

It was a good think I take screen shots because if you look at my login information the city that had my account was not listed, the emails disappeared from my email account like it never happened.  I also think they got access to my laptop as I had passwords in my account that were only these long numbers for website info and if you went there was nothing. I did delete these as there were about 6 of them.  I am very security conscious so this is truly freaking me out.

For example, when I attempt to browse the youtube homepage, it is as if I never visited the site before; the recommended videos are random and the site defaulted back to the ugly new design. I never log into youtube so restoring that session is the only way to get the algorithm to recommend the random junk I like to watch lol. </p><p>My facebook account was also logged out. </p><p>The session cookies come up when I search for them from the options menu, but the session ID or whatever has likely been changed. Is there any way I can restore the old session cookies from a backup/earlier FF session? Where are individual cookies even stored now?

If this is missing, do something on the Youtube page to create it. Just disable autoplay on a video or change the sort order if you are viewing someone's videos in their profile    For PREF, double-click the Value to edit it and replace it with f6=8 or add it to what is already there with &amp;f6=8    Click off of the Value or press enter to save it and then refresh the page. All Youtube pages will now use the old layout </pre> <p>(Thanks to Abhinav Mahto @ <a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-restore-the-old-YouTube-layout#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-restore-the-old-YouTube-layout#</a>) </p><p>If you cannot find the PREF parameter, download an extension such as Cookiebro and search for ""youtube"". </p><p>Click on ""*.youtube.com"" to first expand the tree, then right click ""*.youtube.com"" and select ""Create a cookie for this domain"".  </p><p>Configure the new cookie exactly as shown in the attached screenshot and click the Update button when finished.

I periodically flush my google/youtube cookie UIDs and start over like this all the time, except I always kept the parameter that enabled the old yt homepage. I'm glad I figured out exactly which one it was (""PREF"") so now I know that is the only one I need to keep between refreshes. </p><p>Naturally this update bug happened on my day off and right after I had already recently reset those UIDs. I work in IT... and am in the middle of contract negotiations on top of that. Instead of much needed rest here I am still working on this problem, hence all the frustration on my part.

Unfortunately I cannot find any relevant cookie data in them at all. Not in cookies.json, not in cookies.bak or whatever it is called, and not in any of the various sessionstore-json-backup files that seem to be created after every update. They literally contain everything BUT the cookie data that I need. </p><p>Looks like I will have to use your webapp to literally decode every one of these json files in my possession (I have lots of backups) and then use forensics software to literally keyword search all of them.... just to get the youtube homepage to display properly.  </p><p>Nothing quite like doing hours of unpaid labor to restore basic functionality to a web browser in 2020. I appreciate all the new features and whatnot but the whole Apple-esque idiot proofing and nigh-unserviceable overcomplicated session stores kind of defeat the purpose IMO. I thought FF was supposed to be an alternative to browsers like Safari and IE that you need to either know assembly language in your sleep to fix or pay the company $$$ so their product can then immediately break again as soon as your coverage expires lol. </p><p>I did find an article on how to change the youtube style back to the old one by modifying a single cookie parameter. At least that works now, but all the recommended videos that show up are still the same pop garbage on TV nowadays and I think I'm going to vomit. Literally.  </p><p>Also tried using third party extensions (ie cookiebro) but all they do is display existing info and are useless for loading cookies from those json or session files. Oh and yes I have one called session resurrection that was supposed to backup my entire session. Tried restoring from that and of course the backups are gone. Pretty sure that is due to the extension itself being trash rather than a FF problem though. </p> id:1296537,created:2020-03-10 11:08:14 -0800,updated:2020-03-10 11:08:14 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Using a database for cookies is not new.  </p><p><em>Perhaps an add-on or third party utility could read cookies from your older cookies.sqlite database.</em> </p><p>Losing session cookies in a regular update is unusual.

Have completely restarted the browser in and out of SafeMode with the same issue present. Additionally I can interact with the webpage however I cannot interact with any of the menus in the white bar in fact I actually select the icons on the desktop behind the bar. My computer is setup with one 1080p monitor and one 1440p monitor; this bug only appears on the 1440p screen. Going to restart and see if that solves the issue however I wanted to make a note of this error as it appears to be recurring throughout the past few years. Last detail is I am running Windows 10 and all drivers are up to date.

Often when I start it I am told that I need to wait to use my computer because firefox must update itself. Annoying, presumptuous, but expected.

No bookmarks, no passwords no toolbars or buttons. What I do see is a page saying something about profiles and syncing and this new version of firefox which I don't need and don't want and if I had a choice would not have installed. So instead of going on my pc and performing a simple task that takes about 90 seconds, I am stuck trying to either sort of this mess that has been dropped in my lap and sync my settings and hopefully be able to get back everything I can't access right now.

Last night it fixed itself for about 5 minutes and then went back to broken state again. I can't find an easy way to report this to Mozilla, so I'm hoping someone of their web developers would be reading this forum. There's a screenshot of what the addons page looks like in 99.99% of the time. I tried everything I could think of, including deleting history, browser cache, resetting to a clean profile, etc. - nothing changed it back to the normal view. I even tried as described at the end of this article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-look-wrong-or-appear-differently"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-look-wrong-or-appear-differently</a> to click ""View"" menu but it already is set to ""Basic view"", so that didn't help either. Installing an addon works fine, it's just that the website appears as a broken CSS. The browser version is Firefox 73.0.1 64-bit. </p><p>Edit: only the addons page appears as a broken CSS, all other pages of the domain <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> appear to be fine. </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-730;firefox-7301;,firefox,websites,en-US,1296287;1296292;1296295;,rado84,"id:1296295,created:2020-03-09 09:04:26 -0800,updated:2020-03-09 09:04:26 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Firefox should should delete unneeded files from the disk cache to make space for new ones.

Here is the situation: I run a listserv where I post many job advertisements for my students. I regularly post many advertisements in ~20 different categories of job type. Currently, I simply find the advertisements, and then copy/paste the header and links into a word document for that category. I then highlight all, copy/paste into an email for that category, and send to students. This creates an organizational nightmare for me...since it means that I have ~20 different windows open. Also...all of the window-switching is a real pain-in-the-rear. </p><p>I think I figured out a partial solution, but I need some help. I can create a ~20 WordPress blogs...one for each job category. WordPress allows a user to post to a blog via email through a unique email link provided for each blog. In this way, my students will not receive emails. Instead, they will go to a blog to see their advertisements. My problem with this option is that it requires me to copy/paste text into a new email, enter in the correct email address, and then send. This many keystrokes for 100+ advertisements a day will take awhile (even if I use all keyboard shortcuts). It would be really nice if I could create ~20 buttons or icons that I can drag and drop highlight text to, and Firefox would run a macro to copy/paste the text into an email with a preset email address for that job category. </p><p>Anything that could help? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;,firefox,tips,en-US,1296144;,aaron.stoler,"id:1296144,created:2020-03-08 14:10:22 -0800,updated:2020-03-08 14:10:22 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi Aaron, there are a lot of parts to this project.  </p><p>Let's start with sending an email. Firefox cannot send an email message just using what is built-in to the browser. It can send a URL to your webmail site to compose a new message (example: <a href=""mailto:bob@example.com?subject=Opportunity&amp;body=Knocking"">mailto:bob@example.com?subject=Opportunity&amp;body=Knocking</a>), but this is complicated with multi-line messages and you'll need to review/finalize/send each message, so that probably isn't going to work for you. </p><p>It would be easier for a web server to send the message because most include back-end software for that. In theory you could create a web app with the necessary buttons and code to generate and send the emails, but I don't know whether you can find that already built and available for a reasonable price. </p><p>If you can find such a tool, it's probably better to continue with the listserv than start up with WordPress. In my own experience, I could not predict how formatting sent by email would appear on my blog and defaulted those new posts to DRAFT status so I could finalize them properly. So that is more work on the back end. </p>"

Once you sign in, everything is fine. After you exit Firefox and start it up again, you have to sign in again. </p><p>The two ingredients needed to stay logged in between sessions are: </p><p>(A) Website sets a persistent cookie (not just a session cookie) -- some sites require checking a box on the login form for this </p><p>(B) Persistent cookies survive the shutdown-restart cycle </p><p><em><strong>How can this go wrong? Let me count some of the ways...</strong></em> </p><p>(Fred McD already mentioned some of these earlier, but in case you didn't find them...) </p><p><strong>(1) If you are visiting the site in a private window</strong> </p><p>Cookies are not written to disk in private windows, so whether they are session cookies or have an expiration date after we're all gone, they will evaporate when the last private window is closed in your session. </p><p>The two ways a site could open in a private window are: </p><p>(a) Creating a private window in a regular session (for example, Command+Shift+p or right-click &gt; Open Link in New Private Window) </p><p>(b) Setting Firefox to use automatic private browsing on the Preferences page -- </p> <ul><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it </li></ul> <p>In the left column, click <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, then scroll down to the <strong>History</strong> section. Either of these will invoke automatic private browsing: </p> <ul><li> Firefox will: Never remember history </li><li> Firefox will: Use custom settings for history + ""Always use private browsing mode"" </li></ul> <p><strong>(2) If Firefox is set to store ONLY session cookies, and you have not made an exception for the site.</strong> </p><p>You can check for this on the Preferences page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, Cookies section. Make sure you do NOT have a checkmark for ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"". If you do, you need to create ""Allow"" exceptions for sites where you want Firefox to accept persistent cookies. </p><p><img src=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2019-05-01-08-10-39-73a6c7.png"" width=""500""> </p><p><strong>(3) If Firefox is set to Clear History When it Closes and that includes Cookies</strong> </p><p>Most people do not have this setting, but you can double-check here: On the Preferences page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, History section: make sure you do NOT have a checkmark for ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". If you want to use that feature with <em>some</em> types of data, use the Settings button to the right of it to confirm that Cookies are not being cleared. (Also, do not clear Site Preferences if you have made exceptions.) </p><p><strong>(4) If you use an add-on that modifies how cookies work</strong> </p><p>There are extensions to manage cookie lifetimes and removal, including some that expire cookies for inactive tabs. There also are extensions that isolate pages in a container, which creates a separate cookie jar for the pages in that container which are invisible to pages outside that container. </p><p><strong>(5) If you logged out of the site</strong> </p><p>The cookie identifies you to the site, but if your session ended, the site isn't going to start a new one automatically. So if you logged out on the site -- highly recommended for sites that have sensitive data or accounts you can't afford to have taken over -- then the site <em>might</em> pre-fill your user name on the login page, but you will need to sign in again. </p><p><strong>(6) If external utility or privacy software cleans browser cookies</strong> </p><p>If you use CCleaner, Advanced SystemCare or other third party programs that touch browser data, set them not to touch Firefox data. </p><p><strong>(7) If your IP address is unstable</strong> </p><p>Some sites link your identification to your IP address and require a new login if that changes. To minimize the potential for changes, you can check your Firefox connection settings on the Preferences page.  </p><p>In the search box at the top of the page, type <em>proxy</em> and Firefox should filter to the ""Settings"" button, which you can click. </p><p>The default of ""Use system proxy settings"" piggybacks on your system settings (for example, Windows/IE ""LAN"" setting). ""Auto-detect"" can lead to a flaky connection.

(When broken I see the spinning circle indicating video content is loading or buffering, but it never completes and plays.  Never.  If I don't sync my Firefox to my Account using Firefox Sync, these same videos play every time.) I uninstalled, reinstalled etc. and nothing seemed to work to fix the infinite video loading behavior.  I was using Sync to recall all of my settings so I didn't have to go through all the customization I like.  But pretty soon I realized that I could not keep video content on <a href=""http://foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">foxnews.com</a> working after I would sync Firefox to my Firefox account.   I researched Refreshing Firefox and got video playback one time before refresh stopped working to restore playback.   I finally found out about deleting Profile folders and that finally allowed me to repeatedly get video playback after each Account Sync would break the video playback. This also finally stopped Firefox from importing previous settings and let me build a working set of customization from scratch. I'd like to continue using that Firefox Account, but I want to wipe out and overwrite all Firefox Account Sync settings with new ones. My account already has settings and preferences saved, but these are preferences that break my Firefox install every time. I don't know how to either wipe clean my Firefox Account Sync settings to default.  Or, I don't know how to sync my current working Firefox settings and overwrite all settings in my Firefox Account Sync settings with ones that are not breaking Firefox video playback - on select websites like <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.foxnews.com</a>   I thought it was a Fox News website issue initially until I used a Firefox install on a computer that was not sync'd to my account and that Firefox install played <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.foxnews.com</a> videos every time.   In all I've tried to fix Firefox a min. of 6-10 times myself, but fail every time and need a sharper mind than my own to fix Firefox Account Sync on my Account.   Without help, my current solution is to try creating a new Firefox Account and try Sync again there.  Or I need to assume Firefox Account Sync is unreliable and simply more trouble than it is worth. Fortunately after Deleting my profile folder before reinstalling Firefox, I have been able to use Firefox Refresh to fix video playback after I break video playback on <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.foxnews.com</a> each time I fail in testing a solutions to fix my Firefox Account Sync lately. Any help or advice would be appreciated! </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-730;,firefox,sync,en-US,1295929;1295959;1295960;1295961;1295962;1295967;,nathanpalmer,"id:1295967,created:2020-03-07 18:13:59 -0800,updated:2020-03-07 18:57:09 -0800,creator:nathanpalmer,updated_by:nathanpalmer,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1295960"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> If I understand the current status, you have a working profile but you don't have any of the data you normally get from Sync. </blockquote> <p>Correct! </p><p><em>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1295960"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Something brought in by Sync is causing the problem, whether it is a setting or an add-on or maybe some cookies.

At one time, Firefox stored bookmarks in a .html file.

It certainly does not seem to exist as a .html file any longer.  It is certainly not obvious where the bookmark data is now stored. It seems that it is imperative to make a backup of ones firefox configuration, but there is no clear mention of this in the Firefox welcome pages.  Perhaps this should be flagged up more clearly in the introduction, together with clear information as to how to make the backup and (most importantly) where.  It is  no use making a backup on the c:/ drive if that drive is trashed by a later re-installation. </p> id:1295817,created:2020-03-07 01:30:21 -0800,updated:2020-03-07 01:30:21 -0800,creator:karen9093,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you all for your help.

1281418,2020-03-06 08:16:13 -0800,2020-03-08T05:53:20Z,Problem with url bar when opening a new FF window,"<p>Hi,  It's been a while this little buggy behaviour appeared and I didn't take time to report it (or ask if it is normal) until now.  When you open a new firefox window, the default url (for example <a href=""https://www.default-url.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.default-url.com</a>) is displayed and then the corresponding web page.  Just after the window is opened, I used to quickly click in the url bar to enter an url (for example <a href=""http://www.new-url.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.new-url.com</a>). Before, when I was clicking in the url bar, the current (default) url was selected (highlighted), and so replaced with what I was typing.  Since a while (I don't really know in which FF version it appeared), when you quickly click in the url bar after opening a new FF window, the current (default) url is selected (highlighted), but if the current page is a bit large (and thus a bit slow to be displayed), then the current url is de-selected, and the cursor is blinking before the url. And so when you type an url, the result url is a concatenation of what you are typing, and the default one (with my example : www.newurl.comhttps://<a href=""http://www.default-url.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.default-url.com</a>). This behaviour can be reproduced with <a href=""https://www.qwant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.qwant.com/</a> as default url for example. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-730;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1295653;1295677;1295686;1296058;,fichatel,"id:1296058,created:2020-03-08 05:53:20 -0800,updated:2020-03-08 05:53:20 -0800,creator:fichatel,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>If you pres ESC, ok loading is aborted but focus is lost.

That is pretty much all it is good for. If someone has hands on your keyboard, they can get the password. </p><p>If you think someone might start your Firefox and scrape an auto-filled login, the way to prevent that is to set a local Master Password which needs to be entered before Firefox will allow using saved logins. See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins-and-pas"" rel=""nofollow"">Use a Primary Password to protect stored logins and passwords</a>. </p><p>Note: once you have entered the Master Password, saved logins are unlocked for the rest of your session. To lock them again, you have to cancel a new Master Password dialog. One way to do that is to open the Lockwise page and click a Show Password button or Copy button there, because that will prompt you to re-enter the Master Password. If you cancel, saved logins are re-locked. </p><p><strong>(2) Disabling the ""eye"" button in web pages</strong> </p><p>These buttons typically run a script that changes the password field from type=""password"" -- which browsers mask with disc characters -- to type=""text"" -- which browsers do not mask. I am attaching a screenshot illustrating this on Google's sign-in page. </p><p><em>Script &amp; Style Hack</em> </p><p>If you were using the page in Chrome or Safari, you would have a CSS property to ""mask"" characters in text inputs: </p><p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-text-security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-text-security</a> </p><p>Firefox doesn't support that property natively; I don't know whether there are any code libraries for this or whether you need to come up with a solution from scratch. </p><p>Anyway, let's imagine you have that style property available through one means or another. (I was an economics major.) Then, what you could do is set up a MutationObserver to watch the code of the page for input type=""password"" and add a new attribute such as alwaysmask=""true"" to each one. Then finally you would inject a style rule like this: </p> <pre>input[type=""text""][alwaysmask=""true""] {   -webkit-text-security: disc; } </pre> <p>With that in place, wwhen the ""Show Password"" button is clicked, there would be no visible change to the user. </p><p>Attached is a screenshot (from Chrome) of how the mask would look when the two parts are in place: custom attribute and custom style rule. </p><p><em>Other Discussions</em> </p><p>I ran a search and found some threads but haven't studied them: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17017124/security-issue-of-changing-type-password-into-type-text"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17017124/security-issue-of-changing-type-password-into-type-text</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/186919/protecting-against-input-type-password-changes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/186919/protecting-against-input-type-password-changes</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12012798/how-to-prevent-a-user-from-getting-password-field-value-in-console"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12012798/how-to-prevent-a-user-from-getting-password-field-value-in-console</a> </li></ul> id:1298452,created:2020-03-18 01:49:31 -0800,updated:2020-03-18 01:49:31 -0800,creator:kapilindia1982,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Any one please help me for above issue ? </p> id:1296243,created:2020-03-09 00:06:43 -0800,updated:2020-03-09 00:06:43 -0800,creator:kapilindia1982,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1295699"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> That might be a feature on a specific website.

Upon mouseover, a twitch stream may bring up its own set of menus and icons and whatnot on the right hand side. Rather than trying to manage moving the pic-in-pic button all over or what-have-you, simply being able to enable it through the context menu seems like a nice idea. If the service covers the button, you can simply right click the video and activate it from the context menu instead. </p><p>Attached is a screenshot of the problem (that took me about 10 minutes of very careful mouse positioning to get) You can see the pic-in-pic button behind all the overlays (that only appear on mouseover), so being able to right click the video instead and activate from there avoids this. </p><p>P.S.

So, many times when I scroll, that pop-up video starts playing and I don't want it to autoplay.  Second, many times I click on the ""X"" to close the thingie, scroll down some more, and, it pops up again - some times playing again.  Third, I seem to have no control of this type of thingie and I don't know what possible damage it can do to my computer.  And, yes, you will see this thingie on certain types of web sites where the semi-naked girl rolls up from the bottom, dances, and, then rolls away. </p><p>I am a novice/intermediate web developer, so, I am familiar with what HTML and Javascript can do.

At first I though it was a result of myself and the end user being on different versions of FF, but with additional research, that variable was dismissed. Thank you for your time. </p> id:1295202,created:2020-03-04 10:06:14 -0800,updated:2020-03-04 10:06:14 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi ritterskampj, if the file displays even 1/10 of the time, the site probably includes code to render it. Why the code is failing on 9/10 loads could be related to a content/script blocker or some other factor. But it's hard to think about how to diagnose it without information about how the site works. </p> id:1295195,created:2020-03-04 09:40:17 -0800,updated:2020-03-04 09:40:17 -0800,creator:ritterskampj,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Reloading does NOT always solve the problem.  Thank you for the suggestion. I prefer an add-on for displaying TIFF files or for FF to display them.  Since you indicated that FF will not display them (and my research agrees with that statement), it is VERY frustrating when a file sometimes displays and sometime doesn't. Anecdotal evidence says that the pages would load the ""second"" time, ""yesterday""  (3/2/20) but in my testing, the page actually loads about 1/10 the time (which is unsustainable), To test those statements, an older version of FF has been installed on the workstation (same results).  Apparently FF does not support TIFF files after version 58...which can't be installed unless someone provides a secure link and the file browser (when run) is secure. My preference would be for the page to NEVER load (suggesting a server issue) or to ALWAYS load (presenting a solution). I would like for the server side to translate all the documents into JPG or PDF, but have thus far been unsuccessful  in that venture. </p> id:1295148,created:2020-03-04 08:21:01 -0800,updated:2020-03-04 08:21:01 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi ritterskampj, please ignore the spam message promoting an unofficial phone number. </p><p>I don't think Firefox can display TIFF images directly (unlike PNG, JPEG, GIF).

IMO, ""de-duplicating"" bookmarks may fix that one device, but the corruption extends to the data that is on the Sync server; and that is liable to reoccur immediately.  </p> <ol><li> The 'trick' to fixing that is to disable Sync from all connected devices and then go to <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshooting Information</strong> <em>{about:support on the Location bar}</em> and scroll all the way down to <em><strong>Places Database</strong></em>, then use the <strong>Verify Integrity</strong> button.   Wait for the <strong>checkIntegrity</strong> process to run and provide the results chart. </li><li> Then before reconnecting any of your devices back to the Sync server, change your Firefox Account (FxA) password to clear your data from the Sync server which will flush the corrupt data. </li><li> Connect with the new FxA to a device where the Verify Integrity process was done. Allow some time for a fresh process to be completed. </li><li> As you connect other devices back to your Sync account don't rush things. Each Sync Account is sharing space on a Sync server, and depending upon the overall load on the server that your account is connected to, along with the amount of data you have 'synced' (<em>and other variables</em>),  it could take a bit of time for a clean Sync process to run.  </li><li> And if you have a mobile version of Firefox connected to your FxA the processing done on the Sync server is exponentially more complicated and thus more time consuming; although the <strong>Firefox for</strong> <em><strong>mobile</strong></em> devices don't seem to suffer the corruption that is seen on laptop / laptop devices. </li></ol> id:1294917,created:2020-03-03 09:51:09 -0800,updated:2020-03-03 09:51:09 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi WMLawson, please ignore the spam message promoting an unofficial phone number. </p><p>There de-duplication add-ons but I haven't tested them in years.

The colors used in browser toolbox (Ctrl + Shft + Alt + I) *Style Editor* uses Code Mirror selectors. Due to less than perfect sight &amp; the poor visibility / contrast colors of found search terms &amp; several other things in Style Editor, I needed to change things. </p><p>I didn't have too much problem finding most of CM's CSS selectors for what I needed. In all the CSS files associated with code mirror in the dark theme, I haven't found how to change the foreground (text) color when selecting lines or sections of code. </p><p>In Linux, Style Editor's default selected background is almost the same as the body BG color (looking at the hex colors used, and just visually. This from codemirror.css in omni.ja, changes selected, unfocused background: .CodeMirror-selected {  </p><pre> background: #D4E7F9 !important; </pre> <p>This changes the selected, focused BG color: .CodeMirror-line::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span &gt; span::selection {  </p><pre>  background-color: #E9ECD8 !important; } </pre> <p>But I've found nothing for foreground ""color,"" to make the selected text legible through the light selected BG color I chose.  Just adding ""color: #0000FF !important;"" - under the background property doesn't work (like many CSS styled UIs - especially text editors). </p><p>Is it possible that Code Mirror doesn't have a way to change the text color on selected areas?  Most text editors I've tested usually have preference menu settings for things like selected - foreground &amp; BG color.  Or they have themes that add extra UI styling ability. The themes on code mirror's site don't seem to use selected foreground color (or just ""color"").  Maybe it doesn't understand that concept. </p><p>If the highlight BG color chosen for CM is fairly light with some transparency, you can read some darker syntax colors, but not all. </p><p>Using another text editor with better search, I looked &amp; searched all files I could find that control some of Style Editor's / code mirror's colors. </p><p>The only thing I found where I could change selected text color was one rule for searching in Style Editor.  It's in codemirror.css ... and it doesn't work that consistently for visibility.  /chrome/devtools/content/shared/sourceeditor/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css </p><pre>The default colors (someone) used for search term matches have little contrast. </pre> <p>LINE 330: .cm-searching { </p><pre> background-color: rgba(255, 255, 170, 0.6) !important; /* The 1st BG value listed is for focused search result highlight.*/  color: #0808E5 !important;  background-color: rgba(2226, 253, 251, .6) !important; } </pre> <p>NOTE: I added the color property in "".cm-searching"" -  and it worked.

This has taken a long time.  It's like that last bolt you have to remove on an engine.  There's usually one that takes almost as much time as all the others, together.  Some of the ways things work in Style Editor, or lack there of, look like things I might put together.   </p><p>I finally found part of the problem - why search highlight colors (only in Style Editor) are so unruly. </p><p>The ""search engine"" in Style Editor apparently sucks (technical term).  It doesn't have the capabilities of the other dev tools.  Style  Editor won't use a 2nd color for unfocused search matches (don't think). You also have to continually hit Ctrl+g to advance to next search hit instead of Enter or space bar. </p><p>It may have to do w/ Mozilla's tinkering, but using 2 .cm-searching background colors - one below the other, just uses the 2nd value for focused &amp; unfocused matches. </p><p>And, Mozilla added a file, mozilla.css with code for codemirror searching. As you know, CSS code for Style Editor has "".cm-..."" or, ""CodeMirror-...."" in the selectors. Plus the code from codemirror.css.  Now we're trying to add more codemirror searching code to a userChrome.css file.  Suffice to say, background colors I entered for search highlight were not what came out the other side. </p><p>Not sure if something for focused search hits would work, like .cm-searching .CodeMirror-focused .CodeMirror-selected { background-color: &lt;focused color&gt;, </p><p><br> I managed to make search matches visible - mostly by using a ti, uh, hot pink for text color &amp; the border, under the highlighted background around search hit - color: #FF00ED !important;. </p><p>There's a very small amount of color or transparency difference in focused &amp; unfocused search hits.  Most wouldn't notice it. </p><p>I'm not sure if the code in mozilla.css can be overridden. I tried the usual tricks &amp; didn't work. We could modify the codemirror.css &amp; mozilla.css files in omni.ja, but the next Fx  update would undo it. </p> id:1295273,created:2020-03-04 17:54:54 -0800,updated:2020-03-04 17:54:54 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>There is a dark-theme.css file. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/devtools/client/themes/dark-theme.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/devtools/client/themes/dark-theme.css</a> </li></ul> <p>I see what you mean with the BG selection color. </p><p>These rules in codemirror.css and variables.css seem to apply. </p> <ul><li>resource://devtools/client/themes/variables.css </li></ul> <pre>.CodeMirror-line::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span &gt; span::selection {     background:      #d7d4f0; } .CodeMirror-line::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span &gt; span::selection {     background: #d7d4f0; } ::selection {     background-color: var(--theme-selection-background);     color: var(--theme-selection-color); }</pre> id:1295242,created:2020-03-04 15:05:55 -0800,updated:2020-03-04 15:05:55 -0800,creator:Joebt,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks.  I have fonts set = bold, too (in another rule). That doesn't help much if the syntax color of something happens to be somewhat near the color of the selected text background. </p><p>You're using the light theme, which may? make selected text background color work a bit better?  I have to use a dark theme. </p><pre>I don't think the background you show:  .cm-s-mozilla.CodeMirror-focused .CodeMirror-selected { /* selected text (focused) */  background: rgb(185, 215, 253); } </pre> <p>is actually placing the BG color BELOW the selected text, in this case. </p><p>Why?  Because the very lite yellow selected text color I use w/ 0.6 alpha value, significantly dulls / fades almost all the syntax colors in Style Editor.  If it was really underneath the dark text, it wouldn't reduce fairly dark colors' contrast.  </p><p>A syntax color like med. gray / dark beige is barely visible - even using 0.6 alpha in rgba for pale yellow selected text BG. (affecting Style Editor).   </p><p>The short workaround is use a very low rgba alpha value (.2) on the BG color.  </p><pre>It's no longer light yell (on black body BG color), but it's visible enough to easily see where highlighting begins / ends, and it hardly affects the color of selected code. </pre> <p>As for the question, ""does Code Mirror (in Style Editor) have a hidden option to change foreground text color (to something contrasting) when selecting text (using what they call ""background"" color)?  I think I answered it myself. </p><p>No, I don't think it does - not as it's configured in Fx devtools.  Mozilla decided on some things to leave out, or even picking colors for you. There are several bugs, asking devs to change specific colors in Code Mirror, meaning it's not easy (or near impossible) for users to do. </p><p><a href=""http://CodeMirror.net"" rel=""nofollow"">CodeMirror.net</a> has an addon listed,  ""mark-selection.js"".  Its demo shows normal change of text color when something is selected / highlighted.  If codemirror had that ability, there'd be no need for the simple addon. </p><p>However, I didn't find details (anywhere) how or if addons could be installed when codemirror is embedded in an app like Fx.  Discussions I found on using CM addons sounded like if using it as a <strong>stand alone </strong>editor. </p><p>FYI - everyone, <a href=""http://codemirror.net"" rel=""nofollow"">codemirror.net</a> has ""themes"" (CSS files) that change mostly syntax coloring (have previews). They would be editable.  I think they'd have to replace the ""default theme"" in ""codemirror.css,"" in omni.ja, then repack omni.ja.   </p><p>Unless you wanted most of the default theme's colors changed, it'd be easier to copy the theme's code, then put it in the firefox profile folder: <strong>chrome_debugger-profile</strong>, in a userChrome.css file you create. </p><p>You can view codemirror.css contents by pasting:  chrome://devtools/content/shared/sourceeditor/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css, in Firefox's URL bar.

Along the course of the years, I found out that inverting the text-background colors is a good practice to reduce the eye-straining and increase my reading speed.  </p><p>To achieve this in Firefox, I installed ""Dark Background Light Text"" add-on and it I used to work out extremely good. However, in June 2018 (Firefox 61) this add-on lost the priviledge to operate in the embedded PDF viewer.  This is extremely painful (considering that on average I open 40-50 PDF per week), and I often I have to download/open the documents outside Firefox. This often turns out to be a disrupting process, that makes me lose focus when swapping back and forth between the PDF viewer, my IDE and the browser. </p><p>I don't know whether there is a way to activate this feature and I think I made a couple of requests to implement it, but, as of now,  I've never received any answer. What makes things worse the Firefox's PDF viewer is the __only__ viewer that doesn't support this feature natively. Is there a way to enable this in Firefox? (I could be as desperate as to try to volunteer to implementing it in the code myself)  </p><p>Please, don't leave my support request unanswered  any longer. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;darkmode;firefox-730;,firefox,customize,en-US,1295306;1295307;1295310;1295331;1295338;,ninocangialosi,"id:1295338,created:2020-03-04 23:58:53 -0800,updated:2020-03-05 16:17:04 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:cor-el,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Here is a bookmarklet that works as a toggle: </p> <pre>javascript:/*PDF - toggle filter invert*/(function(){var L='style_PDFI',S='#viewerContainer&gt;#viewer.pdfViewer&gt;.page{filter: invert(100%)}',SS,E=document.querySelector('style[id=""'+L+'""]');if(E){SS=E.disabled;E.disabled=(SS==true)?false:true}else{SS=document.createElement('style');SS.setAttribute('type','text/css');<a href=""http://SS.id"" rel=""nofollow"">SS.id</a>=L;SS.innerHTML=S;document.querySelector('head').appendChild(SS);}})()</pre> <p>It looks better if I select all the text as that makes the text color yellow. </p><p>You can modify the bookmarklet to enable/disable the above posted style to override the style rule added via userContent.css. </p> <pre>javascript:/*PDF - toggle filter unset*/(function(){var L='style_PDFU',S='#viewerContainer&gt;#viewer.pdfViewer&gt;.page{filter:unset!important}',SS,E=document.querySelector('style[id=""'+L+'""]');if(E){SS=E.disabled;E.disabled=(SS==true)?false:true}else{SS=document.createElement('style');SS.setAttribute('type','text/css');<a href=""http://SS.id"" rel=""nofollow"">SS.id</a>=L;SS.innerHTML=S;document.querySelector('head').appendChild(SS);}})()</pre> id:1295331,created:2020-03-04 22:59:39 -0800,updated:2020-03-04 23:00:26 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:jscher2000,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi ninoCan, Firefox treats the PDF Viewer as a part of the browser, which restricts what add-ons can do -- basically, they can't touch the document. </p><p>There is a way to apply an invert filter to the PDF viewer using a custom style rule in a userContent.css file.

Ever since the latest Firefox upgrade I can't properly watch or listen to a YouTube video unless I just play one video in a single tab and do nothing else with my browser or computer, otherwise the video is choppy and crackles loudly in my speakers, it pauses, and crawls like my computer is out of memory resources. In fact, sometimes even watching a single YouTube video in a single tab with no other programs running or tabs open is problematic. Nothing on my computer has changed except Firefox; why can it no longer handle activity in multiple tabs or in conjunction with almost any other program running simultaneously? This was never an issue before and it's very agitating.

One possibility would be to create an encrypted folder using a tool like Veracrypt, and put your Firefox Portable folder in there.
