This assumes the master password had been entered correctly when prompted sometime after starting the browser. </p><p>With the Quantum/Lockwise changes, there are multiple, repeating prompts for the master password during the process of accessing the saved login data. Is this a bug, or is there a way to reduce the repeated requests? Because the master password is so important, mine is long and complex. Having to type it in multiple times in the space of a minute or two seems unnecessary and annoying. </p><p>When accessing Saved Logins, it asks for the Master Password. That's OK and consistent with prior Firefox behavior. But then when I find a login and want to look at it it asks the Master Password again. If I then want to copy it, it asks again. If I look at several different logins, each login, and each action on each login, requires entering the master password over and over. That is a bit much, IHMO.  </p><p>Once the user has reached the Saved Logins (Lockwise), they should be considered authenticated for the duration working with Lockwise. Further password prompts should not be needed. If Lockwise is closed, then it would be appropriate to re-authenticate.  The page could time-out and auto-close if left unattended for an extended period of time.  </p><p>Are there any settings to reduce the usability challenges of the current behavior? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tim.11.g

Are my previous tabs in there, and if so, can they be reinstated to my current FF without messing anything up?

1276197,2019-12-31 08:38:00 -0800,2019-12-31T08:38:00Z,Firefox stops downloading resources after heavy use,"<p>When I use firefox very heavily (100-200 tabs open) then after few weeks or sometimes about month of use it stops downloading some resources. Sometimes its videos that no longer play. This time it was images. This time it started with spotify logging me out automatically after I logged in. It did not lag, it was not slow it was running smoothly. It just started to log me out like in 10 sec after login. I switched to Edge and it didnt log me out there. The bug was also in private browsing. Few minutes later I discovered that Aliexpress stopped showing me new images - it would load me images that I had already visited but for new images it would just show me empty box and image alt text. This also broke in both normal mode and private browsing mode. In Edge this also worked so I understood it was firefox problem, not my network problem.  </p><p>To solve the issue I tried to clear recent history for time range everything and checked cache and offline website data. It did not help. Then I also tried to use forget about this site from history and Ctrl + F5 to make it force reload data. It did not help either. I also tried garbage collection and cycle collection because I thought that something was wrong in the memory. </p><p>After these operations I tried to manually visit image location which I grabbed using inspect element. It turned out that firefox indeed downloaded the image but it turned out it did not completely download it. It downloaded 8.22kb data instead of 12kb and image viewers were not able to open it while visiting the same url with Edge gave me correct image which means that it wasnt faulty resource on server side. </p><p>When it previously happened to me videos stopped to play both in private and normal browsing. It also does not seem to be dependent on FF version. This time it happened with FF 70.0. It was not running out of disk space - had still over hundred GB left nor RAM (it only used 25G out of 64G). I use Windows 10 x64. </p><p>I know I could have solved this issue with browser restart (which I did by now) but but since I usually have a lot of stuff going on and just restoring tabs isn't enough for me because reloading tab from internet does not restore it exactly as it was before since all the JS progress will be lost but sometimes some tabs I need exactly as they were which is why I would not like to restart firefox very often. </p><p>I would like to know what causes such issues and if there is any other way than browser restart to fix it? Like manually deleting something from somewhere? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Win32FFUser

I had what I thought was the correct sessionstore.jsonlz4 file for the old session, judging by the file size, but apparently the new session was written into that file, and the old session moved to a section with key ""lastSessionState"".  I could not find any information on opening that ""last session"", so resorted to uncompressing and editing the sessionstore file.  I removed the initial section for the new session, and removed the ""lastSessionState"" key.  The remainder of the file seemed to have the same structure as the initial session section.  Not having an easy way to re-compress the file, I copied it into the profile as sessionstore.js, as, once upon a time, folks said that sessionstore.js would be read if sessionstore.jsonlz4 was not present.  I hid all the files in sessionstore-backups.  However, when I started Firefox, it did not find the old session.

It's gotten maddening to be perfectly honest as there doesn't appear to be any solution to the problem and I've honestly reached the point after this feature being so unstable for so long that I don't understand why the feature even exists since it's never worked reliably sine it's inception.

However onto the problem.  I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser.  My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ).  The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load.  In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space. </p><p>I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked.  I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter.  So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe.  However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on.  When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine. </p><p>Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head.  I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default.  I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem.  Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem. </p><p>Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet.

Here is an example of a return label. <a href=""https://www.wayfair.com/session/secure/account/print_labels.php?label_id=11186731&amp;Or=2953552973&amp;Svc=&amp;csn_id=A691DFAE-672C-4481-9D3B-EB2D17913431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wayfair.com/session/secure/account/print_labels.php?label_id=11186731&amp;Or=2953552973&amp;Svc=&amp;csn_id=A691DFAE-672C-4481-9D3B-EB2D17913431</a>  Another example is downloading. If I try to download, Firefox crashes, again with no crash report or notification to me. Many times when I try again it works the second time. But sometimes it doesnt. Firefox just closes without a trace. Then I have to do restore last session. As I said, with some operations, it works if I do it again, but with others it does not.  I looked at Windows Event Viewer &amp; the application log. It has many evens for each day &amp; a total of 17,703. I found one from a couple of days ago that mentions Firefox &amp; another one that mentions Software Protection &amp; lists a number of items with a long list of letters &amp; numbers that look like Firefox crash reports   When I use Chrome, I dont have these problems. So I have made Chrome my default browser although I prefer Firefox if these problems can be fixed. Thank you.

Twitter, for example, when logged in, have this and it is proven by scrolling down, copy the text of the tweet, scroll away from it far enough, then CTRL+F and paste the text you copied and it wouldn't find it since the tweet you copied the text is unloaded. This happens on chrome but not on firefox for some reason. </p><p>Testing this feature [View Page Info] -&gt; [Media], I noticed that the log does not update but rather displays the loaded content at only the time when the user makes this window appear. It does not update if the page changes. </p><p>I am suggesting that the list automatically updates (can be as a checkbox option) after the user made the window appear, and also persist the loaded URLs (also a checkbox option) so that they don't disappear when they unload. </p><p>Another suggestion is the [Inspect Element] -&gt; [Network]: enable the user to copy all the URLs on the list, currently, I can only copy one at a time and is annoying, especially for those in the realm of combating malvertising and tech support scams.

Agent works fine when I run it from the desktop. </p><p>When I was using Chrome (last week), I could download and ""open"" nzb files from Chrome, which automatically launched my Agent newsreader program. Then I could use Agent to fetch the message, and open it. </p><p>When I try to do this with the Firefox browser, I can get Firefox to open Agent, but it is as if I was just now installing Agent for the first time. Agent asked for my registration key, and accepted it, then it asked for me to start the Agent program initial set-up. </p><p>I tried configuring Firefox to launch the program from c:\program files (x86)\agent\agent.exe but this made no difference. </p><p>I am now saving all nzb files to my download directory.

So I lost my Firefox 52 install with all of my extensions (that still worked).  Now, I'm running v. 57 Quantum, and a few things aren't working correctly. </p><p>First, the MAJOR problem:  when I open a link from a bookmark, it's clobbering an existing tab that I was using (that's why it was open, obviously).  That is completely unsat and can not be allowed to continue.  How do I correct this?  I can't find the option under settings--&gt;tabs to fix this problem. </p><p>Second issue (major annoyance):  I can no longer create a bookmark directly in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar.  I used to be able to open that bookmark folder, and the first option was to bookmark the currently open tab.  That option has vanished, and i use that all the time.  How do I restore that? </p><p>Actually, one more issue:  I have two tabs that are pinned and are supposed to be protected (i.e., nothing can clobber them, and I can't close them without deliberately turning the protection off (context menu right-clicking on tab).  I need that back, because for some reason, firefox thinks it's ok to open a bookmark in those tabs, too, when it most definitely is NOT ok. </p><p>Thanks, Jim Graham </p><p><em>[Personal information removed by moderator.

It's as if no headphones were connected at all. </p><p>I opened up the volume mixer and included screenshots below. On the left, when I'm not connected to the headphones, the sound plays via the speakers and you can clearly see mozilla's audio levels in green are ok. When I connect the headphones (middle photo) the sound still plays via the speakers but there are two firefoxes and one is playing audio, the other is not. I don't know why there are two, I only have one tab open. Lastly, when I switch the audio device to headphones, Firefox completely disappears from the list of applications playing audio. I opened up other browsers and played audio in each and they are listed in the applications, as you can see in the last photo. They are actively playing audio as indicated by the green audio levels and I can hear them via the headphones.

I removed the plugins from the directory manually then started again. I downloaded the NPAPI version from adobe (pictured). I then extracted the files and copied the plugin (<a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>) to firefox's plugin path ($MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH, which for me was /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins). I then restarted firefox. However, the shockwave flash plugin is not present in the plugins tab. This is odd as it was a couple of days ago before I redid this. Sites like newgrounds worked perfectly. Back when flash was working, I noticed on some sites that used html5, it would instead try to use flash. For a whille, the openh264 was stuck on ""will be installed shortly."" Now when I go to those sites, it will show the thumbnail, but not play. Youtube videos still work, however. In fact, it's really the only video site that still works. Was there a dramatic change in the past couple of days or something? I didn't even update firefox myself, this happened seemingly out of nowhere.

The behaviors started some time in the last six months or so.  I just noticed them in the last week when I updated the website.  The website is <a href=""https://281connections.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/</a>  and I am using using Firefox 71.0 on Ubuntu Mate 19.04  . . . Question 1 When accessing the hosted site, the script that toggles the menu to drop down is ignored (<a href=""https://281connections.us/#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/#</a> ).  (Using a Chromium browser, I can get the script to run by telling it to “load unsafe scripts”.)  The script in question is run in Firefox without objection when the same code/site is invoked from files local to my machine.  I can not find a setting in Firefox to allow the script to execute when invoked from hosted source.  I have tried an assortment of settings changes, but can’t find anything that works.  Can you help? Question 2 Javascript that runs a dynamic page (<a href=""https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html</a> ) runs just fine using Firefox and the hosted website.  However, when invoked on local files, it does not run.  (It presents a large circle, but never fills it with information.)  Is there a setting that will allow me to see dynamic page when invoked locally?  (BTW, the behavior is identical using Chromium for what that is worth.) </p><p>Last note - disabling extensions does not affect the behaviors noted. </p><p>[Thanks for your consideration.] </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-710;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1273037;1273071;1273113;1273122;1273144;1273344;,craig.rhombs

When attempting to use FF to log in to One Drive directly -- meaning, I go straight to the One Drive login page via bookmark, and do not attempt to enter One Drive via a ""side door"" such as a link on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> -- I encounter significant latency and, often, outright non-responsiveness. Last Pass will not autofill the login credentials; nor can I type them in directly with anything other than crippling latency, if at all. Same latency with password and 2-factor entry. If I am able to survive log-in, One Drive presents significant lag to clicks, often accompanied by fleeting clues in the lower-left corner of the screen, usually involving cryptography such as ""waiting for cdn-15 <a href=""http://office.net"" rel=""nofollow"">office.net</a> . . . "" or something similar. Often the word ""Excel"" or ""Word"" will be displayed in one of those messages, but they are so fleeting (and appear to be truncated for display) that I can't capture them completely. </p><p>Switching off extensions appears to have no effect. The lag and general unresponsiveness continues. </p><p>Interestingly, when I instead log in directly to Outlook (and not One Drive), and then move into One Drive via a One Drive link that is presented in the Outlook waffle button, then One Drive appears to behave promptly and normally. No lag issues that I can determine. (Also, with all FF extensions=true, login and use of Outlook is satisfactory. No problems that I can see). </p><p>The Windows One Drive app, which runs on the local system, also appears to function normally. I can see/modify files in my One Drive via the local app. That's groovy, but sometimes you need to see the file system in the web browser. </p><p>So I guess that's the workaround: Get access to One Drive by going *through* Outlook.

And within a day my 5 hour marathon had been completely wasted as they were in a heck of a mess again.  Could someone please try and include ""A straightforward way to reset and rebuild your bookmarks- AND SYNC THEM!"" in the design doc? And put that a set of clear instructions somewhere? But in the meantime - please let me know how I do this. Surely ""reset  and rebuild from here"" is an obvious requirement? Thanks guys - this hurts because I'm completely in love with the ""new"" Firefox and how safe I feel with it. So help me here! </p>",windows-7;desktop;sync;firefox-710;,firefox,sync,en-US,1272272;1272459;,radiocam

Most recently, on this computer, it asked me to send an SMS to my phone to login to Firefox Sync on my phone. </p><p>This would be reasonable, except for the fact that I'm already using Firefox on my phone, and have it actively logged in with the account I'm logging in to. When I go to look at my devices on <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>, I have 6 devices listed, including my phone ""last seen 7 hours ago"" and my main computer ""last seen 3 hours ago"". It's clear to me that these are active devices, and that I don't need to install on any other devices to get sync working. </p><p>The main reason this is annoying is that I don't get any confirmation that I've completed logging in - only a prompt to do something unnecessary. I can work around this by simply ignoring the prompt, but I'm concerned for other less tech-savvy consumers who might be confused, thinking they're still not done when they login to Sync on their second device! Imagine someone logs into their phone first, and then the computer - it'd be pretty confusing to then have the computer ask them to sign in on the phone. </p><p>I personally was slightly confused, and had to double check that bookmarks were actually syncing and that I hadn't accidentally made a new account or done something to erase my previously logged-in devices... </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-680;firefox-6801;,firefox,sync,en-US,1272500;1278290;1278292;1278293;1278386;,daboross

I'm not sure why this is, but the more important problem came later.  </p><p>So I tried fixing that by going into the Firefox profile folder and restoring previous versions of the sessionstore files. Unfortunately I wasn't making any progress and at one point reopened Firefox to see that my entire history disappeared. I'm not sure how this happened. I know the history is stored within the places.sqlite but in no way shape and form did I go near that file.  </p><p>I used ShadowExplorer to find an earlier version of my profile folder and copied and pasted it as a backup. I used the places.sqlite from that but I was still getting an empty history and it was also not recording any more new history. I also tried pasting the entire backup profile folder onto the main profile folder. And I tried creating a new profile and transferring my places.sqlite there but I get the same result. However my bookmarks are still there.  </p><p>Is there no way to get my history back? I'm guessing it is a corrupted places.sqlite. Is it possible to repair the places.sqlite? Sadly I don't have any knowledge on how to use SQlite shell to repair it myself. It would be nice if someone could do that for me! Strangely, the places.sqlite file size is 10240kb, which seems a bit too small for my entire history.  </p><p>I'm terrible at explaining things so I apologize if it was hard to follow.

However there's not means of archiving, syncing or backup for all your fastidious work configuring your various websites to open within specific containers.

Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon?

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected.  </p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there. </p> <ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install.

Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment. </p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again. </p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem.... </p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.

I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible. </p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password."" 	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW 	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing 	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway 	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.' 	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.

Any help will be appreciated.,"<p>I have done everything that is in the support answers, but to no avail.  When I open FF in my jalopy (10 yr old computer), all my current bookmarks, and history for the past 5 years are still there.  After copying the profile, and the entire Mozilla folder (separate attempts), and over-copying the folder in my new computer, there is no change; the files only go back to when I first installed FF on it.  None of your support answers say anything about whether to copy the jalopy files into the local, or roaming folders, so I copied it into both.  Still no difference. </p><p>In a related migration/replace problem, I cannot sync my new computer with the old, even though they're both in the same account name.  The jalopy and new computer names are both recognized in the jalopy, but the new computer doesn't pick up the old computer name.   This was the first thing I tried to reconcile the two machines.  I am extremely frustrated, and at my wits end dealing with this problem.  Any reasonable assistance and solutions are appreciated.  Thank you. </p><p>P.S.

This is done with the Task Manager. However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks. Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10. I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes. </p><p>This is not a serious problem.

Even when I enable the ""offline mode"",  tabs with heavy javascript continue trying to load, consuming CPU resources. I want they to stop immideately.

I explored about:memory, and tried the vmmap.exe (process memory analyzer) from the Sysinternals Suite, but I have not succeeded so far. Auto unload tab -- is not a solution. For example I clicked on links and opened 30 tabs in background. PC starts working very slow, Now I want to stop all them, and to read the loaded information (webpages). How to do it? I think it is the weakest side of Firefox. Needed to abrupt all attempts to make network connection, after the ""offline mode"" is enabled. I need something to stop javascript's attempts to connect, to calm it down. I want to start read webpages already loaded, and javascript occupies CPU. To kill threads in the Process Manager is not a way to do at all, Auto-unload also, I want to read those webpages.  I have enough of RAM, it is not used more then a half.  Many years ago, when there was HTML4, I used for a little the Maxton browser. It had a button to stop all pages. All similiar Firefox extensions do not act effectively like that. the issue not in scarcity of RAM, but in a badly design of browser's architecture, that javascript occupies users' PCs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1271330;1271333;1271335;1271338;1271410;1271415;1284669;1284683;,clayten.braylan

The other is AnonymoX which I use for general purposes. </p><p>A few days ago I upgraded to Firefox 71.0 as well as updated my Windows 10 to the latest 1903 version. Today I noticed that both extensions have stopped working. AnonymoX just doesn't work, whereas the other plugin, upon activation, says (translated) ""Conflict detected! Proxy settings are controlled by a different plugin or cannot be set up"" Trying to circumvent a block (and only then - unblocked websites work fine) now either redirects me to the ISPs blocking page, or alternatively produces a ""Secure Connection Failed PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR""  message after a long TLS handshake. Running the same extensions in Chrome does not reproduce the issue - blocked websites become accessible as usual. The issue also persists for three different connections - a public wi-fi network, a private network and a tethered 4G connection, all served by different ISPs. Finally, I am not running any anti-virus software or firewall. Thus this seems to be a Firefox issue and not a system or network issue.  </p><p>This also doesn't seem to be an issue with the country's blocking system itself because other users around me are still able to circumvent blocks using the same extensions and I am able to circumvent blocks using a similar extension on my Android phone with a local SIM.  </p><p>Things I've tried so far: 1) Made sure that both Windows and Firefox are set to not use a proxy </p><p>2) Reinstalled the extensions </p><p>3) Created a different profile in Firefox.

1274301,2019-12-04 14:02:33 -0800,2019-12-06T17:38:45Z,What caused profiles to torque two days ago?,"<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask the question that comes at the end of this note.  If you scroll to the end, you can see it marked as MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW. </p><p>As I was posting the question, I took advantage of the moment to reflect on the fact that FireFox's perseverance over its long history of ups and downs today has made FireFox one of the real hopes for humanity.  Long Live FireFox! </p><p>Back in the dark ages, before the ascendance of Google's Chrome browser, I learned to recover FireFox's guts, to cope with its gastric spasms of projectile digital vomiting, which seemed to occur every few weeks.  Most software in those days contributed full shares to the unusable stew, made the accumulation of digital barf that needed cleanup as often as I needed to clean up after hangovers from over drinking when I was a stupid youth. Those were the days when running a computer all day without being forced to restart taught me to weild Windows Task Manager as weapon, which usually provided a side step around enough of the binary vomit top cut restarts from 4 a day to only one or two. </p><p>Years later, while Microsoft was recovering from the largest, most expensive public mistake in software history (Windows 8), Google got a handle on Chrome.  After that, around 2014, Google either found Popeye's spinach factory, or aliens joined them in their Mountain View offices, because no human force can account for the rate and quality of significant upgrades to all their systems since then, for Chrome browser, underlying Chromium technology now used by everyone, not just for browsers, but all manor of application software to run on all kinds of platforms, Android for phones and apps, YouTube video processing that spots copyrighted sound and images in every video that has it, the world-leading advertising systems and dashboards, and their search engine so much better than anyone else's our choice is to use Google Search or be stupid and slow, or use Google Maps or be lost.  Google pumps out new and better software features one hundred times faster than any other organization.  If you missed the media reports explaining this, that is because Google's super productivity has not been celebrated in anything like the degree warranted.  </p><p>Unfortunately, Google also has become so evil  it probably cannot be prevented from destroying the system of human checks and balances invented in the United States 240 years ago. As simple and feeble as those checks and balances are, without them it is hard to see how any substantial part of the human population ever could have experienced and lived with Liberty and the productivity it makes possible.  For example, without the Liberty growing throughout the world after taking its initial root in the United States and our written Constitution, one of the most ingenious and consequential documents ever written, the normal result of military conflict would have been one murderous, tyrannical, wholly self-serving dictatorship or another forcing 99% of the human population to live as serfs or slaves in the involuntary service of people like you know who.  Google and the rest of the power players in commercial media are destroying that, through political bias they lie about.  The problem with their lies is they have the power of their media platform to perpetrate them.  Google is evil and needs to be neutralized.  The main thing I can do about this is to stop using their products.  The other thing I can do is tell people about what is happening.  I was raised to see things this way, but for until recently, I did not see this is the way we have to look at things because this is the way that works.  Until recently, I did not know society cannot stop functioning, but now I know that the functioning we all take for granted, including the people fighting against it, is rare as diamonds when viewed in the context of human history, Some of the people attacking our country want to break it down, because they want the United States to become like the places people now leave in order to come here.  The sickness is the same that has affected all gluttons for power.  They have learned that force of military arms tends to galvanize people like you and me.  Instead, they lie to us. pretending to harbor the same loves for life you and I have, when in truth they see us is idiot patsies, making us deserve their the damages wrought by their treachery. </p><p>Therefore, I stopped using Chrome, returning to the FireFox way of browsing.  I was with Chrome so long, I forgot all about recovering browser profiles.  FireFox is a lot more reliable today than it was before Chome blew everybody out of the water, but its profile system still ha regular bouts with projectile digital vomiting. </p><p>Today, my FireFox is not blasting bile all over the house, but is being rather brave holding the contagion within itself. I noticed passwords not filling into web forms that used to be there. I am not sure of the timing.  I probably was a long time ago, but I kept getting messages from FireFox babbling about their new security system. </p><p>Today, I needed to identify active profile (i.e., the one I use) from the half dozen profiles piled into my FireFox installation.  I don't know why there is more than one.  Unfortunately, I just could not glean the one I need to look at from their names: </p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/ n34593ht.default-release/ n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/ q412vz1p.default/ uiaqaxwu.default/ </p><p>The online guide provided the usual waste of time.  I asked the computer how to know which profile is the active one.  I immediately found thousands of articles which each spell out the same eight or ten reasons why a person might wish to know which profile is active. The people writing these articles know their articles are filled mostly with spam (information we already have or don't need), but their editors are evaluated on word count, needed for diluting the concentration of ads in their publication.  It's been years since the ANSWERS were easy to pick out of spam portions of the articles they appear with.  From this agony-inducing swill I found information that looked like it might tell me how to spot the active profile.  ""Look for "".default"" as part of the profile name.  So I looked again, </p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/ n34593ht.default-release/ n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/ q412vz1p.default/ uiaqaxwu.default/ </p><p><br> All of the profile names contain "".default."" </p><p><br> MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW. Then I noticed the dates </p><p>Months ago   b2uzr27w.default-release-1/ Months ago   n34593ht.default-release/ Two days ago   n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/ Today  q412vz1p.default/ </p><p>Evidently, two days ago, FireFox ditched my profile and gave me a new one.  This leads to my question, my reason for posting this thread: </p><p>Why? </p><p>In other words,  </p><p>Why did FireFox ditch my profile and give me a new two days ago? </p><p>I understand, you probably don't know why in my particular case.

Except for Firefox. No matter which page, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Twitter... no sound for videos. Firefox is quiet. If I check my sound settings, the bar for sound input is not even moving, seems like Firefox is just not recognising or forwarding any sound to my USB G560 speakers. </p><p>On the other hand, everything works in Google Chrome and sound is brilliant. The problem just seems to be with Firefox. I disabled all audio devices, especially my old audio-out where I had my old speakers. I updated the drivers for Realtek HD Audio (even though I am sure I do not need them for the G560) and also updated again driver for the G560 as well as the Logitech G Hub. Firefox is also the latest version. </p><p>But nothing. Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560. </p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices. Re-Installing the G560 drivers does not change anything. </p><p>So if I wanna have any sound in Firefox I am depending on the error message popping up... which happens only rarely. But that can't be the solution :( It seems to me the problem is with Firefox, in the way it handles the sound channel or content or whatever... and does not recognize my G560 via USB as speaker system.

I found one missing piece on the Firefox product in general. It doesn't sync my settings when I log into the new device. The settings I'm talking about are Search Engine and Notification, although I think this can be applied to any other settings that I'm not using or aware of. Long story short, since I quit using Google Chrome (although I can't quit using Android, I still disable Google services and provide with least of permissions to any services on the mobile device) I switched back to Mozilla Firefox browser and using in on all my devices (Windows, couple of Linux Desktops as well as Android) and I found that when I login to my Firefox account I still have to change Search Engine from Google to DuckDuckGo and I wonder why Extensions are being installed and synced while search engines are not. Also same thing for Notifications. I don't like being notified and disable all kind of notifications for all Web Sites (no exclusions).  Can you please include these pieces to sync when login to the account or have a checkbox in case if some users want to keep different settings on different devices etc...? </p><p>Thank you, </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-700;,firefox,other,en-US,1270331;1270365;1270374;,schalykh

This also does not list ds9, nor is it in the ""View all applications"" list, so I go to ""Find new applications"" which offers me the same selections in fancier format, but also has a search box.

For some reason I can't recall, I ended up with one window with one tab, and one window with all the tabs I'd had open on my old machine (including the one that was open by itself in the other window).  I closed the window with the single tab, and continued using the window with many tabs.  At the end of the day, I closed the window as usual and shut down the computer. </p><p>The next day, I turned on my computer, opened up firefox, and no tabs!  I checked to make sure that ""open previous session at startup"" was checked in the main settings, did some searching through the help files here, and found that the problem was that I hadn't gone in to the privacy settings to tell it to remember history.  I fixed that, and did some more digging to figure out how to restore history, I don't remember how.  I restarted Firefox, and it restored a previous session ... but not the one I wanted.  It restored the window with the single tab that I'd only had open for about ten minutes, not the window with all my tabs (including that one) that I'd had open all day.  Some more searching through the support here and I figured out how to restore the session I ACTUALLY wanted.  I can't find the post now, but it told me to go to Help - Troubleshooting Information (I think--it LOOKED like the Troubleshooting Information page, from what I remember, although today it doesn't seem to have the option I used yesterday, so it might have been a different page) and see if there were two sessions, and if so, to click the other one, and see if that fixed things.  It did!  I got the window with all the tabs back, and closed the window with just the single tab, and went on with my day.  Problem solved, right? </p><p>No.  I booted up my computer today, opened up Firefox, and what did I find?  IT OPENED THE WINDOW WITH THE SINGLE TAB THAT I'D ONLY HAD OPEN BRIEFLY, INSTEAD OF THE WINDOW WITH ALL MY TABS IN IT THAT I'D HAD OPEN ALL DAY.  First of all, I'd rather not have to deal with this again, so how can I make sure it doesn't?  What is going on? </p><p>Second, I can't find the help page that told me how to restore the correct window.  This is a problem, because although all of the tabs I had open yesterday are in my history, when I go to the little library icon and look at ""history"" both the ""recently closed windows"" and ""recently closed tabs"" are empty.  As far as Firefox is concerned, I haven't closed any windows or tabs since the last time the history was deleted, despite having lots of pages in the Recent History list that I sure don't have open right now.  Clicking the three horizontal lines to get the main menu, there is no ""restore previous session"" as an option.  I can go through the history and manually click on all the tabs that should be open, but that is REALLY a pain and I would like not to have to do this again.  I have added the ""Tab Session Manager"" addon, so hopefully even if this is a recurring problem I can use that to get around it.  (The addons listed below are all the addons I had when the problem occurred.)
