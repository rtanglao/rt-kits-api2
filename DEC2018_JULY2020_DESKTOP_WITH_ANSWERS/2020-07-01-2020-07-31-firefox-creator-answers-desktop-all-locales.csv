It all works fine, except when I click those links, Firefox switches to the new tabs immediately when I click them. I would like the tabs to open in new tabs but I do not want Firefox to immediately switch to them. </p><p>Please note that I have unchecked ""When you open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately"". Meaning, Firefox correctly does not switch to new tabs for normal links.

And everything worked fine for aprox. 1 month. But today to my surprise Firefox told me that master password is wrong. I've typed this password at least several times before (with success) so I was sure that I remember it correctly. Fortunately I had it on the paper. I checked it - and I realized, that I remembered it correctly. So I tried once again but I failed. I tried few times with the same result. I had the same password also for different site. So I logged on that site - with success. So my keyboard seems to work correctly. I didn't change master password in Firefox. At least I am not aware of that. It was unchanged for whole period I used this feature, as I wrote it wasn't long. Fortunately I have all important passwords saved on the paper so I decided to reset my Firefox Master password. It is possible that I've lost less important passwords but I can reset them because I still have access to my most important data. I do not need any help. And I am aware that I could made mistake of any type. But I decided to report that because there is also a chance that this is Firefox error so you should be aware of my case. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;windows-10;masterpassword;firefox-790;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",artur.a.sakowski

Sometimes, when I click one of the links, a new tab opens with no URL. Sometimes, when I click one of the links, a new tab opens with the URL in the URL bar, but it doesn't navigate. And sometimes, finally, when I click one of the links, a new tab opens and the page I was actually trying to get to appears. </p><p>This doesn't happen just on my homescreen. Sometimes, often in fact, this happens on Reddit. This happens on Autoblog. This happens on CNN. </p><p>I have refreshed Firefox. I have nuked my profile entirely and started anew.

This does not happen on all folders on the menu, but the ones it happens on vary from day to day.

I currently have 15 folders showing on the toolbar and 5 of them consistently misbehave.  </p><p>I'm on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 using the Gnome desktop/window manager (not Wayland).

On the profile I'm using to reproduce the error, the http_https_only tag in about:config is set to 'false', so [[this|<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172126</a>]] is irrelevant. I made sure that firefox is indeed what is set to open these types of files via the xdg specifications that firefox searches for when looking what to open a file with via xdg-mime (firefox uses xdg-open on the linux version to see what to open with): xdg-mime default firefox.desktop application/x-shockwave-flash In $HOME/.config/mimeapps.list, it is properly listed in the line applications/x-shockwave-flash=firefox.desktop Firefox does have a .desktop file setup in /usr/share/applications, and xdg-mime does recognize firefox as the app to open swf files. I am able to open other types of files locally such as videos. Going to about:preferences and setting firefox to open swf files makes an infinite loop of firefox opening new tabs that must be then terminated. I'm not sure if an update broke firefox, as I was previously able to open local swf files. Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1337501;,japaneselearning101

So I tried copying and pasting the saved profiles back into the new Mozilla Roaming and Local profiles, but I can't get Firefox to access them.  Instead, it only accesses the new profile. I did an uninstall and tried it again, but all I ended up doing is creating another new profile. Now when I go to About:Profiles (see image), the default-release and default profiles listed don't seem to exist anymore (they aren't loadable, and they can't be found using the filepath noted there), and the actual backup profiles that I copied from my portable drive into Mozilla and that I actually see in File Explorer, doesn't show up as a profile choice.

I signed into sync  as usual because this is not the first time I've had to do this over the last few years actually about two months ago I did the exact same thing to another computer with no issues on the same account. This time however sync did everything except for all my add ins after waiting, trying to find solutions online etc. etc. gave up, but gave it 24 hours more to try to figure out what was going on. Ran across a few articles that Firefox 79 change something with sync but don't understand exactly what they're talking about why this would affect this installation, so I then looked at  the versions installed on each system, my main system is running Firefox 78 or I should say was running Firefox 78 I thought upgrading it to 79 would fix the issue so I did and that did not work. in the meantime I proceeded to uninstall Firefox 79 on the second machine that refuses to sync the add-ons and replace it with Firefox 78, during this process I removed all Firefox entries related to profiles installs updates etc. I tried to wipe every mention of Firefox on the machine as if it never have Firefox installed on it before. Installed 78 signed in to sink expecting everything to work as normal and still nothing it's been two hours since the install I have re-synced multiple times in hopes of getting it to work with no success it appears to sync everything but the add-ons, and yes I have add-ons on the sync list on all computers have double triple and quadruple checked that to make sure . I really don't want to have to manually run from computer to computer to figure out what add-ons I have and all the settings of each one to make it perfect because I have had issues in the past of installing an add-on on one machine and the settings being different on another causing issues between the add-ons would appreciate if somebody could tell me how why or what the hell I'm supposed to do here to make Firefox think actually work again the way it had worked for years I really need these computers identical in every way as i am disabled and have mobility issues such related to all be installing and uninstalling. Thanks for your help in this matter and I'll do my best to answer any questions to help you guys figure this out. Also I'm not even remotely familiar how to file bug reports or anything else so somebody wants to suggest that I would appreciated if they are able to do it on my behalf and I will give them all the information so it's done properly. Thanks againI just noticed that there's troubleshooting information able to be shared this information is being shared from the computer that works absolutely perfect and is the computer I want to sync from below if somebody wants to explain to me how I can get that data and add it to this post so you guys can compare and figure out what the heck the problem is I will do it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",hillvalleyfarms

My old laptop died the other day and so I bought a new one and put my old drive in an enclosure.  I had my Firefox heavily customised (over the past eight years) and I don't know how to transfer it over.  It used to be that I would just copy the users over and everything would be cool (XP to W7 didn't give me this problem) but it's not working this time.  My guess is that it's because my old laptop used Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  My desktop monster uses Windows 10 Pro but this new laptop uses Windows 10 Home (which is just awful compared to Pro) so there's probably an issue with how the user profiles are handled.  I didn't have a Firefox account because I didn't want every machine I use to have the same Firefox setup.  This was because my desktop and laptop are used for different purposes entirely. </p><p>Does anyone know how to import the settings from a Windows 7 profile to a Windows 10 profile?

One would think if you donate several hundred $ a year to Mozz and you'd think there would be some sort priority support for Donors.  My other devices can't sign in either... Ive tried most everything I've seen in support and nothing seems to work. I feel as though the more i mess with it the deeper I'm sinking! I have a back up that is from 2018 which gaps the last 2 years of data and PW.. I Still have my old recovery key password that didn't work in the beginning when all of this happened, nor does windows master password work.

It's really glitchy sometimes; either it doesn't show up at all, then I have to manually copy paste my login data, or it moves around on the page when I scroll down, open up the keyboard etc. </p><p>So I thought, why not use Google's autofill, the feature I've always loved, because it works just perfectly, on Firefox instead. Did that on my tablet and mobile phone, as luckily you can select your autofill provider on Android. Sadly there's no option on Firefox so far (or I missed it, I quickly went through about:config but couldn't find anything there as well)... Maybe there's some hidden option or a safe addon that lets me do that? </p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated!

I also can't tell if there is one sole cause of all of these issues or several, but please do your best to explain what's going on. </p><p>1-2 months ago, some strange things started happening with my computer repeatedly. Consistently, a command prompt would open unexpectedly, saying something about Chromium failing to update. I couldn't do anything with that program, so I just X'd it out, and maybe around a minute later Firefox would crash and restart. Once that happened, my Firefox home page would be set to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a>, and the default search engine would also be changed to Yahoo!. And on my desktop, shortcuts for Internet Explorer and Chromium would be added, and the shortcut for Chromium would be automatically pinned to my taskbar. </p><p>Windows Security would then notify me that it's blocked a threat, so I'd go to check it out and remove said threat. Every time, it;d say the blocked threat makes changes to browser settings without proper permission, and the blocked threat is called ""sodecitot.exe"", located in a filepath like c:\programdata\{5b729525-380e-6a38-89c28-8402d0dace36}\sodecitot.exe (just in case it's some obscure ID, I've swapped out those numbers and letters with random numbers and letters). Then Windows Security reports ""Remediation incomplete"" on the same threat, implying it attempted to restore itself. That letter and number folder name notably follows the same format as a bunch of folders which were last modified when I first turned on this computer on January 1, 2019. </p><p>I was getting a lot of such reports from Windows Security on very similar threats, having various different letters and numbers for their folder names, and I figured it was likely malware, so I made several full scans with MSERT, Malwarebytes, Windows Security, and Windows Defender Online Scan, all to no avail. </p><p>I don't even know why Internet Explorer is installed, but its files were last modified in February 2019, so I think it's just a shortcut that was added. </p><p>I'm not sure what Chromium is or why it's installed either. I tried to look it up to learn more about it but found nothing useful, and its executable looks like a blue version of Google Chrome's logo. Some parts of Chromium's installation were last modified in October 2019, but most of its files were modified just today. </p><p>Notably as well, when these problems started happening 1-2 months ago, there were two instances of all of my desktop shortcuts having weird visual issues, one being the little arrows on the shortcuts (which indicates it's a shortcut and not an actual file) being replaced with a X's, and a separate instance where the Audacity logo was over top every other shortcut for a few minutes. </p><p>With the same events happening today, a new error message opened, saying something about Windows Explorer attempting to load the C runtime library incorrectly (screenshot included). </p><p>I also considered turning to Mozilla, Google, and/or Microsoft support when this was originally happening, but then it suddenly stopped. I had a bunch of screenshots of some of the weirder things, but since nothing was happening for a while I deleted them. Now, 1-2 months later, it's starting right back up and I don't know why. I suspect it all links back to Chromium, but I'm not sure if I can just delete its files and call it quits, because I don't know if it's supposed to be there. It seems like something by Google, but I can't even confirm that. </p><p>So yeah. Any suggestions? </p><p><br> </p><p>My computer has a Windows 10 operating system. Mozilla Firefox is installed and constantly open, used for entertainment. Google Chrome is installed and constantly open, used for work. Apparently, some part of Google Chrome's installation trips off Malwarebytes whenever I make a scan. Removing it causes Chrome to crash, and once I open it again that part is replaced. Usually, I just remove it so I don't miss any other threats, and then just restore my closed tabs. Audacity is installed and has a desktop shortcut. Internet Explorer is apparently installed, and there is no uninstall executable as far as I can tell. Whatever it is, Chromium seems to keep trying to install itself, with parts of it already existing on my computer. </p>",desktop;other;malware;escalate;windows-10;escalationresolved;firefox-780;malware78;,firefox,other,en-US,1336551;1336552;1336826;1336845;1336854;,jcclay1

I solved the problem by installing an extended release version of Firefox, 52.7.4, which still supported the maff extension.  Et voilà, all my maff files now open. </p><p>I have held onto my old XP machine because I have a boatload of legacy graphic programs which I do not want to spend the hundreds of dollars to upgrade to Windows 7 or 10 versions.  Recently someone gave me an XP machine which is newer and has a much better processor than my own.   </p><p>So I figured if I just install Firefox_ESR_52.7.4 I would easily be able to open those maff files I wish to store on the (new) XP machine. </p><p>Curious thing, the only version I could find to download Firefox_ESR_52.7.4 came in a zip file with no installer.  I mention this because I'm wondering whether it may not be the cause of the fact that I cannot get this version of Firefox to open files with the maff extension.  I right-click the file to ""Open With"" and select Firefox from the list, but it then simply goes into an infinite loop of showing me the Open With dialog box.  I even put Firefox.exe into the Send To folder, and the exact same thing happens. </p><p>When I downloaded Firefox_ESR_52.7.4 for my Windows 7 machine, it did come with an installer, but I cannot use it for the XP machine because it is the 64-bit version.  And for the life of me I cannot find anywhere to download ESR_52.7.4 with an installer. </p><p>Anybody out there who could shed some light on this problem? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Dandelion </p><p>P.S.:  I tried to post this question using Firefox (my extended release version) but after signing in, the page just hangs... and hangs.  I suppose this is because I'm using a version of Firefox which Mozilla deems unacceptably outdated.  But my argument has been and always will be that there are extensions I cannot live without, so as long as the newer versions of Firefox do not support those extensions, tant pis.  I use Chrome 95% of the time. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1336374;1336532;1336628;,Larkspur19

Looking into the bug that this is potentially attached to I found this information ( <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1652912"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1652912</a> ) :  Having NS_FaultTolerantHeap::APIHook_RtlFreeHeap in the crashing stack means Fault Tolerant Heap (= FTH) has been enabled for firefox.exe. FTH is automatically activated when Windows OS detects some heap-related issue which it thinks can be mitigated by FTH such as double free. This crash means Firefox crashed due to some heap related issue earlier, which enabled FTH, but probably FTH was not be able to mitigate the heap issue.  First of all, can you check FTH is activated for firefox.exe through event viewer?  1.	Open Event Viewer from Start menu (or, run eventvwr from command prompt)  2.	In the left pane of Event Viewer, go to Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Fault-Tolerant-Heap &gt; Operational  3.	If FTH is activated for firefox.exe, you'll find Event ID 1003 as the attached screenshot.  If FTH is activated, instead of looking into this crash, we need to investigate the original heap issue without FTH. You can disable FTH by stopping Diagnostic Policy Service. Can you do the following steps to send us a crash report without FTH?  1.	Open Command prompt as Administrator  2.	Run ""net stop dps""  3.	Open Firefox and follow the steps causing the tab crash  4.	Send a crash report  5.	Go back to the command prompt and run ""net start dps"" to re-enable the service  This may be caused by a third-party application. Given that 99.26% of the crashes of this signature involves AccessibleHandler.dll, do you use a screen reader or some accessibility related application?  If it is related to a screen reader, you may have to use Chrome for the time being until you can get more assistance :( </p><p>You gave me this instruction: 2.	In the left pane of Event Viewer, go to Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Fault-Tolerant-Heap &gt; Operational  Two issues I had:  On a screen reader, I have no idea which is ""left column"" and ""right column"" since to a large extent a screen reader is rather ""divorced"" from the physical layout that sighted people see on the screen (I am totally blind and don't even have a monitor nor mouse running on this machine).  Then, I found application and services log... but I did not find anywhere Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Fault-Tolerant-Heap &gt; Operational  I had Microsoft &gt; and several things with Windows but nothing about fault tolerance. When I went on to your second request: 1.	Open Command prompt as Administrator  2.	Run ""net stop dps""  3.	Open Firefox and follow the steps causing the tab crash  4.	Send a crash report  5.	Go back to the command prompt and run ""net start dps"" to re-enable the service  </p><p>When I did step 2 as Administrator as you asked, I got the error message that Windows cannot find ""net stop dps .  I tried the command both with and without the quotation marks and got the same error message.   Please remember that the Windows 10 on my computer is the HOME version, not the Windows PROFESSIONAL VERSION with all the security stuff found on that version and used in office environments.   From a practical standpoint, unless you folk have another suggestion, it appears that i will likely have to GIVE UP ON FIREFOX (remembering from your message that most of these particular crashes result from an issue with Firefox working with screen readers) until a time comes when Firefox might be updated to resolve issues between Firefox and screen readers.  I believe I will contact Vispero, the publisher of JAWS, to let them know about the problem I am having with all these crashes in the current version of Firefox. Of course, I am open to try any other suggestions to further diagnose the problem, if I can carry them out with speech and NO SIGHTED HELP. </p>",desktop;accessibility;fix-problems;escalate;windows-10;bug_1;a11y;escalationresolved;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1336317;,knobman

These links go to named anchors down the page. This problem only exists in Firefox. I have tried it in Internet Explorer and Edge and it works properly in both. Clicking the links follows them properly. It's when I use the back button to go back to the top of the page, and only on the first link, that the problem occurs. The button becomes dimmed as though it went back, but it didn't. It stayed at the location of the first named anchor. This only happens with the first one, not the others on the page. The back button works properly on all of the others. </p><p>I even put the page on my website to see if being online made a difference (since it has only been local up to this point). The first time I clicked the first link and then the back button, it worked. Every time after that it doesn't work. Again, this only happens with Firefox, so I am thinking it must be a bug. </p><p>Any help to get around this, or do I have to just accept that Firefox will have this issue until it doesn't? </p><p>More info: </p><p>I added another anchor before the first one to see if that would make a difference. It didn't, and now both the new anchor and the old first anchor had the same problem. I tried renaming the anchor. No go. Then I added an image to the top of the page (below the links, but before the first anchor). Lo and behold the (now) second anchor behaves properly and the back button returns to the top of the page, but the new first anchor still has the problem.

I am quite good in informatics. The specs of the hardware are very good, it has 16 GB ram and SSD. The problem is that Firefox is very sluggish every other time I restart the PC. I use only a few add-ons and plugins. When I restart in safe mode, it still supersluggish. For instance, I play speed chess online and I lose because the animation is not moving, the chessboard freezes. It takes like half a minute to open Gmail and start a new email. To open anything, it takes ages. It takes ages to respond to a click on a webpage. Restarting the PC normally resolves the problem. I have Avast antivirus, Zonealarm firewall and I regularly run spyware scan too.  My drivers are up-to-date. The laptop works well otherwise. Even when Firefox becomes sluggish, the overall RAM and CPU usage is below 20%. My internet is 100 Mbit/s, wireless. </p><p>I already refreshed and reinstalled Firefox. No help. It simply just does not want to work sometimes, and I have to restart. Every time I reinstall Firefox, I have to turn off hardware acceleration, otherwise no video content can be played (it shows a black screen with the spinning wheel). Any suggestion will be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",akofalvi

The little boxes in the top right to maximize screen are there, but when I hit that icon, firefox shrinks and those boxes to maximize the screen disappear.  If I right click when in the small window, there is no option to maximize.  I have restarted several times, did not work.  I have most recent version of firefox and windows 10, which I use on my laptop.  This is a firefox problem, as it does not happen in chrome, but I prefer firefox as my default browser.   I have now spent 3 hours trying all the fixes on the support web site, but it seems I have a choice to either see firefox full screen without bottom taskbar or in a small box that is useless for me.  I also had the problem of the top tabs disappearing, but I seem to have fixed that.  I really need help!  I could not even get a good screen shot when firefox is just the little box.  I don't know if it is related, but my icons on my desktop also disappeared, but that is probably a windows problem.

All of the issues (at least those I've discovered so far) are noted on the attached image, so there's little point in repeating them here.  The greatest problems are with new windows: issues A and B make new windows almost useless (without a lot of extra effort to work around the issues), and the fact that I can no longer add more tabs to a new window is simply intolerable.  (If I attempt adding a tab, it somehow ""locks"" the window, and it cannot be exited or deleted without taking down Firefox.)  The second problem is that at least some menu items in the ""original"" window(s) from the previous version no longer work correctly, if at all.  The latter ""if at all"" (Tools|Page Info) is something I heavily depend upon because other browsers don't have such a tool.  (I have not tried all of the other Tools to see if they misbehave, too.)  To me, it's all part of what makes ""full-featured Firefox"" better than ""crippled Chrome"" (which touts speed but deliberately, for the sake of that speed, has restricted its features compared to Firefox).  Unfortunately, there is no option in the ""Help"" dropdown to try reloading and reinstalling the current version (to see if that will fix the problems), so I'm stuck. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1335555;1335754;1335773;,harveyh

So I use MacOS with Firefox as the default browser, both of which are running the latest version. I use SwissCows as the search engine and the problem I encountered was that when I would click on one of the search results, it would open the link in a new tab. As one may imagine, this would get confusing quickly. To fix the issue, I went into advanced preferences and adjusted <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow</strong> and <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction</strong> values to 1 and 0 respectively. It fixed that problem, but now I have a new problem. Certain links from third party email app or log ins from extensions will open in the current tab instead of opening in a new tab.  </p><p>Any advice or is this just something that I am going to have to learn to deal with? </p>",mac-os;desktop;tabs;firefox-780;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1335534;,jfragoso96

I figured maybe one thing was fine until I realized that Widevine actually did some bad stuff to your OS, since it needs to access the internal OS to block screenshots and screen recordings. Today, I discovered that geolocation also uses Google servers, and in the process of turning it off I also discovered that there is this ""Safe Browsing"" that also uses Google. Looking even further, even some of the privacy things redirect to Google. I haven't even mentioned that the default search engine is Google. Even if Google paid you to make them the default, you could create a prompt on the first launch asking for search engine, with Google selected by default but another search engine (like DDG) recommended. All of this Google software is likely sucking on our data. </p><p>Now while writing this post, I noticed something even worse. Why are Google servers on the filter whitelists? This is uncool. I understand, maybe your website needs to detect Firefox to function correctly, and antifingerprint would break it. But WHY GOOGLE? All of this seems to be going against the goal of privacy. How are you supposed to expect a random person to go directly to about:add-ons, disable Google Widevine, go to about:preferences, disable safe browsing, go to about:config, enter the ""danger"" zone confidently, and delete Google from the 10,000 times it appears in the config? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1336036;1336462;1336485;1337787;1337793;1337875;1337956;1340032;1340897;1340898;1341057;1341108;,matthew34

In the process of telling Firefox to open PDF files with PDF X-Change Viewer, I noticed that one of the filetypes in the list is ""Vectric"". I don't know how to have Firefox tell me the extensions included in this filetype, but I assume they would be .crv, .crv3d, .3dclip, and others associated with Aspire, my Vectric software app. Files like this I would only ever want to save, but on trying to say so I discovered that ""Save File"" isn't one of the options in the dropdown menu. So my questions are:  1. Why is ""Save File"" not given as an option for the Vectric filetype? 2. How can I get ""Save File"" to apply to the Vectric filetype? 3. Why on earth is such an obscure filetype as ""Vectric"" specifically listed here, anyway? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1335388;,fsawtelle

Even if you don't understand Dutch, some articles show an indicator - see the image below - that marks there's a video that will start playing. If I leave the mouse pointer by accident on such page, it will be opened even if I don't click! I only want pages to open when I click on the link, not because the mouse pointer was for some time parked over it.

This is complicating my image saving process. I am using the Add-on named ""Save webP as PNG or JPEG"" which works, but slows down my saving process considerably. The Add-on does not remember the last folder I saved an image to, and adds several additional clicks to what used to be a simple process. </p><p>Is there a way in about:config to prevent Firefox from putting webp as the default file format in the Save Image As dialog box? </p><p>Suggesting that I use Internet Explorer or Edge is crazy.

It seems to be triggered when I click on Firefox to open it as the below then occurs.  At first I thought it was dues to the new MS Edge (firefox is my default browser, but then I noticed that the laptop was ok until I clicked on Firefox.  This may be just coincidental but seems to be the trigger.  </p><p>For several weeks or more, MS edge seems to have taken over the laptop - Edge opens of its own accord and begins to open up tens and tens of tabs about Get help with Windows 10.   I have to close the windows and MS Edge but it soon reopens and the issue repeats itself. </p><p>As i can not delete Edge, I have reinstalled Edge but it is just the same.   I have run a Malwarebytes scan but nothing was reported and similarly with a Bitdefender scan.  I have also updated the drivers.   </p><p>I thought that maybe if I try to use Edge to go to a web site or make an inquiry (it might become pacified and behave!) I can only usually type the first character and then the Windows Settings window opens and meanwhile Edge displays tens and tens of tabs re get help with windows etc. </p><p>The laptop had Wind 10 installed between 1 - 2 years agon from Win 7.  Win version now is 10 Home 1909 it has not updated any other win updates since Jan 20 apart from a very small one in the last week suggested from a scan but that made no difference to the issues above. </p><p>Edge is not the default browser because of all the issues.  Occasionally a message pops up about a software violation but the refeerences given re address etc seem to be different each time and the message goes off quickly so little chance to make a note of the ref numbers.. </p><p>Any ideas of  what I can try as it is really making the laptop of little use currently. </p><p>I am not very technical  so please bear that in mind in your replies </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1334555;,JimHR

There is no home internet available and the cell phone service is poor - my only option is to tether my cell phone to be a wi-fi hotspot, but because we are down in the valley relative to the nearest cell phone towers, even this leads to frequent interrupted connections.  I often get the message 'No internet access, connected' from my wi-fi connection.   </p><p>With that situation, how can I set up Firefox to best deal with that reality?  In the Netscape days, when universal internet was a rarity, there was a switch for 'text only'.  Does that still exist?  What else is there to help Firefox out in this situation?   </p><p>I go into town once a day, and use the open wi-fi from either the library or a coffeeshop for anything that requires uploads, downloads, or streaming.  There's an assumption out there that everyone has strong internet access 24/7, and so programmers and designers no longer seem capable of accommodating people with poor connectivity.  I would say that this lack of internet is a common problem all across rural Canada, and there doesn't seem to be anything going on to fix it in the immediate future. </p><p>All advice gratefully accepted.

Am I expecting too much or is this not the way its supposed to work? It honestly feels like the auto sync works to some extent but its only updating/syncing maybe once an hour while I browse. This issue is not not device specific. They all seem to have very slow or bugged sync use where the most recent tabs are not synced unless they have been open for a very long time. </p><p>What are the events that trigger a sync if any and/or can I manually set the frequency at which it auto syncs? I really sucks when I leave a page open at the office for 10 minutes shut down and go home and its not synced. None of these devices have any internet connection issues and everything else seems to work just fine. I am also running the latest as of Friday version of Firefox on all my devices. This has been an issue for me for years. I was finally annoyed enough to look for a solution and found none. So here we are.

When I have a certain number of tabs open it stops just short of scrolling all the way down. Leaving the bottom of the bookmarks pop up open with the rest unavabile to reach. </p><p>2) It will not save any of my history and yes I have checked the ""Remember browsing and download history"" and the ""Remember search and form history"" and it still has not saved my history of any sites. </p><p>3) Previously if i had a tab up it would inform me of the website on that tab and take me there if i tried to search that same article, video, etc. For example is I had a tab already open of Kobe Bryant highlights (R.I.P.) then if i tried to type that same video in another tab it would lead me to the tab I already have opened. It currently isn't doing that. (Example Below) </p><p>4) In the history tab at the top it show a short history of sites I went to before the reinstall but it won't update for new sites. So there has to be a file somewhere keeping that information. I want to find it. </p><p>5)Finally a lot of the issues I've described I haven't found a simple solution for that involves MacBooks. So if anyone has an answer please tell me step by step what I should do in the Mac version. </p><p>I use Firefox to do a lot of legal research and I normally have anywhere from 25-50 tabs up from different statutes, cases, articles, etc. I need help so I can effectively research without constantly searching through each tab and never being able to bookmark or save anything.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1334023;1334025;1334030;1334031;1334079;1334149;,va52248715

If I keep the browser running it seems it'll happily fill in my passwords without ever again asking for the master password. </p><p>I do not think this safe enough. How do I make the browser ask for the master password after a certain time, even if I don't restart the browser? </p><p>I did a bit of research and I found the <strong>signon.masterPasswordReprompt.timeout_ms</strong> parameter under about:config. I don't know if I misunderstood the purpose of this parameter or it is just broken but this parameter <em>does not</em> set the master password timeout in milliseconds. Its default value is 900000, which would be 15 mins. The browser most definitely does not ask for the master password after 15 mins. I tried to set this value to various smaller values to basically no avail.

Why does the library Firefox only sync to yesterday July 15? 2. If I were just to use one, and only one, computer (let's say my own laptop) to surf with Firefox, how long can the history go back till? What I mean is: Does the Firefox program automatically purge history after X number of days/weeks/months?  3. If so, how can I tell my Firefox program to never purge my history? I want my history to be stored indefinitely, just like how my Google searches are stored for me to refer to when I want/need to.  4. If there's no way to prevent Firefox to purge history, what's the best way to export my history in some human-readable format (like csv)? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,sync,en-US,1333590;1333641;,msupp.9a

No extensions even. Account was synced properly before reinstalling and everything was working. Even after countless Windows and Linux installs I've never had a problem like this, I always got everything synced at once in only a few minutes. </p><p>When I noticed that I didn't get any of my extensions I went to check my bookmarks and, not only I have a few of them, but they're also all over the place. Some in Other Bookmarks, some in folders with letters, but not in their respective folders, which are either empty, with a few bookmarks or they don't even exist. </p><p>It gets worse now. I've checked my phone and everything was intact. So, I naively synced my phone. Yup, now my phone's bookmarks are as messy as they are on my desktop. BUT, there's a few more bookmarks and folders, which are fuller even. Weird. </p><p>I went to check previous bookmark backups from a few months ago and compared them to a backup I just made. There's like 8MB of difference in the JSON files (Yes, I had a ton of bookmarks), so I guess I'm missing on a few thousand entries. </p><p>I've already completely cleaned and reinstalled FF, checked integrity of the databases and even moved them so FF could create them again. Same results. My guess is that my sync data got 'corrupted' or something when I synced the first time and it then affected the Sync Server when I kept insisting. ""About Sync"" extension shows that I'm getting everything correctly (As in everything I get I can see on my bookmarks list) and the sync logs show no error at all, so syncing is successfully happening. Now Sync is only turned on on my desktop just to see if something magical happens after a while. </p><p>I know Sync is not a backup service and that I should have made backups, but is there any way to recover everything I had? I know that I can clean the sync server by changing the password, then I could sync my from my not-so-ruined-sync-yet phone and/or import that months old backup, but I'd like to leave that as a last step. </p><p>Sorry for the long post and thanks for the help. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",1999.mpk

So you have to decide which way you want to move the window and choose the appropriate end of the tab bar. Compared to Chrome, the FF tab bar is really skinny - even though the difference is only about 1/16 or 1/8 inch, that small difference is enough in Chrome to grab the window where you want and drag it without opening the tab right below where you're grabbing.

Sessionstore encodig recovery.,"<p>Somehow the sessionstore just showed a blank tab, but (if opened with a text editor) the sessionstore file containts the complete session (even the latest tabs) but its not possible to recover from that. If you for example open 5 tabs and then close firefox (and wait 2 minutes and check in the task-manager that its closed) and then deleting everything in the 'sessionstore-backups' folder and then starting firefox, then the 5 tabs are there again. I have made backups the moment firefox was not working anymore, but firefox seems to anyhow not load them (have multiple recovery files saved after first problems, instantly). I got the folder from about:support 'open directory' but i'm using Linux (Linux Mint 19 - Firefox 77.0.1). Maybe sessions are saved elsewhere? Firefox even inreased the data inside of them by the new 5 Tabs, so they grow in size, and if you opened it in a text editor you could search the new tabs even, as far as i remember from yesterday. Then i don't remember the order of two things from yesterday: </p><p><br> 1. I moved some recently 'changed' files from the profile folder and then move them back (i wanted to backup, but i moved and the problem was somehow firefox was starting at the same time, it was a mistake, and then i had trouble not knowing if the preferences are still the same, and since i updated from i think 64 to 77.0.1 (i have a list of important changes) some where different, for example i would never have geolocation enabled. but others like the deleted pocket links (in about:config) are still the way they are, so i wonder. and i had multiple files in the moment </p><p><br> 2. the sessionstore now is little (5 tabs probably), i tried to delete session store very often, i dont know if it was after this? but probably. But like i said i don't remember it. </p><p><br> </p><p>But now the new problem. The History and Book marks file does not work, i moved them away or deleted them (of course backup before that) because this was an online tip, but the restoring thing just worked for the bookmarks, and just something between i think 1-3 days ago. </p><p><br> The problem now is i can't recover ANYTHING anymore. I can not really read the recovery file with a text editor, many letters are red, with the linux text editor, it says translated something like ""some symbols don't work, please choose encoding"" and there are many: </p><p>UTF-8 Central European (WINDOWS-1250) Unicode (UTF-16) Western (IBM-850) Unicode (UTF-7) ... </p><p>Over 50 different probably. Some even crash the program, what is the encoding for the recovery file? </p><p>There needs to be an Extension that is able to import and read broken sessionstore files, and 'places' files. </p><p><br> Probably i was to greedy, but i made stupid mistake accidently. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-770;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lonasethu.jw

If I want to sign in to a specific site automatically while still generally deleting cookies when I turn off Firefox, then I need to list all the cookies used by that site in Manage Permissions as Allow. This is easy regarding sites that use cookies all with pme common domain, since you just enter the one domain name. Today I wanted to preserve cookies from a major newspaper, but I find at least five domain names in the cookies that I have to protect in order to enable auto sign-in for that one site. My suggestion is that there be some improved method for easily 'transfering' (rather than writing down and re-keying) selected cookie domains from Manage Data to Manage Permissions, instead of having to rekey them and make errors doing that. If I want to auto sign-in to 15 sites, but keep the controls set for deleting unprotected cookies when closing Firefox, I would have to enter perhaps 75 domains by hand. An alternative might be a column in Manage Cookies whereby I could check mark a cookie, thereby transfering it to show in Manage Permissions, perhaps as defaulting to Allow for Session. Then I could review them and if desired switch each to Allow. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",Quenchoo

1294690,2020-07-12 06:46:38 -0800,2020-07-12T09:20:17Z,How I fixed Firefox Sync,"<p>After digging around, I stumbled into a solution and want to share my experience. A few days back, after reorganizing my bookmarks, I noticed these changes did not sync to my other computers. I followed the recommendations for [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1219438"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1219438</a>] <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1219438"" rel=""nofollow"">deleting certain files to restart the sync</a>, a recommendation to create new accounts, and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1294263"" rel=""nofollow"">reinstalling Firefox</a>. None of these worked. What did work was: </p><p>1. I backed up my bookmarks to both html and json, just in case.  2. I uninstalled Firefox completely, on two of my three computers, then reinstalled. 3. I created a new account. While this is not necessary, I discovered Firefox does allow Gmail's <a href=""https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/12/19/gmail-email-address-tricks/"" rel=""nofollow"">email address tricks</a>  after a plus sign (example: firefox+randomword (at) <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>). I've been doing this more and more for extra security so a hacker can't use my regular email as a starting point. 4. With all computers logged in, I imported my bookmarks and synced. This solved the bookmark issues. But I've lost my history. I logged into my old account to discover my history was erased as expected. Searching for a solution turned up a Windows tool, but also a mention to import to another browser from which to import into my new account. I downloaded Opera and imported my history locally.  5. In Firefox, logged into my new account, I prepared to import my browsing history back into the new account. Lo and behold, a Firefox pop-up asked if I wanted to merge my old Firefox account sync data into my new account. I did, and everything worked-meaning I did not have to import from Opera. </p><p>For admins: It's great there was a tool to allow me to cross import/merge accounts. But why didn't that come up in help docs? And why can't I trigger this myself? Would have made everything so much easier. That said, I'm happy it's all working now and my imports are syncing across my devices. </p><p>If anyone has any questions, as this was hastily written while my kids run around, please ping me and I'll answer as soon as possible. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-780;,firefox,sync,en-US,1332231;1332252;,dweade

I have no issues with my sound card or audio issues of any kind. Google Chrome plays sounds normally, as well as the Edge, this issue is only when I use Mozilla Firefox.  I spent most of the time yesterday and today on trying to solve this issue but with no success. I tried every solution i could find on the internet but no joy. Firefox just don't play any sounds.  As Firefox is my preferred, default web browser this thing is especially frustrating.  Does anybody have a solution for this problem? Please help!

And I am hoping someone can offer a solution, even if it is to tell me I am doing it wrong. </p><p>It seems like others would have a similar problem, and it is sort of difficult to explain, although I'd think there would be a simple solution. Anyway, let me try to explain... </p><p>When I use the autofill option, it is usually while placing an order, or filling out my account details for whatever shopping site, or gaming profile, etc.  But I have multiple addresses I need to consider when I am shopping, and need to send the order to one or the other, instead of my regular address.  Like placing an order that I want sent to my mother's address. </p><p>As anyone knows, when you change something, like the address, state, zip or phone number, you end up with several autofill entries. Like this... </p><p>First Name, Last Name (My primary info, but I can't see it in the pop-up) First Name, Last Name (My primary info, but my work address, which I also don't see) First Name, Last NAME First Name, Last Name FIRST NAME, Last Name First Name, Last Name </p><p>These pop up, all valid options, the next time you start filling out a form.  Which is great, because ONE of them is the one you would like to use, but there is no way to see WHICH one points to the one you need.  The first one is my normal address, phone, etc, but the autofill pop up doesn't show you anything other than the name, the second is my work, but I can't see that it is... only the name. The third might be my mom's address, but again, I have no idea because only my name is shown...etc etc etc. </p><p>Is there a better autofill plugin out there, one that lets you label them? Or some way to show more than just the name? Just showing me the same name 12 times, without any way to know what the right one to use is, kinda makes the autofill feature useless for me.  If I only had one phone, or one address, etc, the feature would work great.  But since I have about a dozen addresses I routinely use, each with their own unique state or zipcode, or phone number, has rendered autofill useless unless I only need the common ""top"" one. </p><p>I hope I've made it clear what the problem is.  And no, using a unique firefox profile for each is not the answer.  I'd have to log out/off firefox and switch profiles several times in one shopping or gaming session, which would only make the solution highly annoying. </p><p>It would be nice to find a plugin, or any other solution, that would let me label, or differentiate each from the other when the autofill pop-up gives me the option to fill the form. </p><p>Like... Home - First Name, Last Name Work - First Name, Last Name Mom's - First Name, Last Name Gary's - First Name, Last Name </p><p>Anyone have a solution, or feel my pain? Or am I simply doing it wrong? </p><p>ANY help is greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1332082;1332084;1333466;1335620;,Lawtonwestberry

It does work when I use IE, and I did find a site that lets me comment using a workaround:   <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/</a>   (I'm not a developer so I can't figure out how to fix things from the info given here).

I did clear my cache, delete cookies for the news site and for Facebook (and then pressed the ""accept all cookies"" button), and disabled plug-ins one at at time to see if they were the issue.

Normally, when I open a new tab, I push the down arrow key to bring up my browser history and access my most-used sites.  Upon updating last night, I discovered that I can no longer do this.  When I press the down key, nothing happens.  To get the same result I'm used to, I have to press the space bar, but I've been doing this a certain way for several years and the motion is completely ingrained in me.  If I turn Top Sites back on in the options, the drop-down list will open upon pressing the down key, but that of course only brings up the Top Sites.  That's not what I want.  I tried rolling back to the previous version, 77.0.1, but that didn't fix anything.  If I create a new profile, the problem persists.  Does anyone know how I can fix this?  I know it sounds like an extremely minor issue, and maybe that's true, but I just want to use my browser the way I like using it.  I'd appreciate any help/input. </p><p>Also, I suppose I should mention that I didn't make any changes to my preferences prior to this issue. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ZombieToast

This is because Mozilla washed their hands of the problem and the robot (obviously uneducated) gave me a song and dance about how this is MY fault and Mozilla is completely blameless.  Mozilla is using the old operator error routine we hear so often when a company can’t be bothered to help a customer. Now I am faced with $50 an hour to have a TRUSTED computer repair person to sort this out. Don’t ever ask Mozilla for help, their uneducated robot will just say it’s your problem. Perhaps I should have just stayed with Google Chrome, at least they tried to give an intelligent answer and not give up on their customer and blame the customer for the problem. I think this is on page 35 of the Mozilla customer service manual. When you don’t know the answer just blame the user and move on to a simpler question.  An uneducated answer is better than no answer at all. Let the user pay someone to fix the problem caused by Mozilla. Good luck if you ask them anything, best not to waste your time and go to someone private or a grade 9 student that knows more about Mozilla and computers than Mozilla itself does. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1331564;,rodger_mckibbon

My other extensions are listed in the ""Installed Plugins"" part.  The issue seems to happen on both Kubuntu and Windows. Thank you for reading. EDIT: I tried without Color, and it worked.

Recently after a FF update, I noticed, when opening a URL link, a small pop up window, lower right hand side would open listing the trackers associated with that page. Most are lined out and a few are not (depends on the page). Then the pop up window goes away.  </p><p><strong>First issue:</strong> How do you make that pop up stay open so that you can read the information it is displaying? How can you recall the pop up, if you need to? What does lined out mean vs. not lined out? Obviously, I can take a guess here but it would be nice to have an official reference or explanation. </p><p><strong>Second Issue:</strong> I would expect that the Safe Protection Dashboard would be in agreement with the info displayed in that tracker pop up window. It does not. Open a URL, the tracker pop up window opens and lists, for example: 8 trackers, 6 of which are lined out, 2 are not. Go to the Safe Protection dashboard and it ALWAYS says ""<em>No trackers know to Firefox were detected on this page.</em>""   --&gt; Well, something ain't right here. These two tracker status indicators should be in agreement. And, just in case, they don't have to be in agreement, then there should be some explanation as to why there are different results. </p><p>Thank you for a great product and the attention to detail. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",plrfl

Can anyone tell me what to do to get this working? Every once in a while it works, but most of the time it will not. I have the same issue when I try doing it via Chat out of my Gmail account. </p><p>What happens is that when I execute to dial the number, the dialer pops up and instantly closes, and the call does not go through. That dialer will not stay open, and it must forthe call to work. This happens whether I try to use it online from <a href=""https://hangouts.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hangouts.google.com/</a> or out of a Gmail e-mail account via Google Chat, which is included in the e-mail account. </p><p>I prefer to use Firefox rather than Google Chrome. But in testing, I find I can make outgoing calls from Chrome. </p><p>Once in a while, this works. In my Google search, I did find one assertion that it no longer will work out of Firefox because Firefox has stopped supporting plug ins (I had no idea -- then Flash also should not work, but it does, I can watch flash videos, so I'm doubtful plugin support is the issue). </p><p>Yet, I do find that Firefox actually offers a Google Hangouts add on! I don't see how that could be if it can't be supported for lack of a plugin. I installed that, closed and reopened Firefox, and tried to dial out of it. Same problem, dialer flashed open and closed, it did not dial out. </p><p>Again, I note, sometimes, rarely it seems, it will work. It should not do even that if it requires a plugin that is not there. I didn't see anything in settings that I would expect could be related. </p><p>I also note, I have tested it on a Windows 10 laptop, again out of the current Firefox, and same issue. So it doesn't appear the problem is necessarily linked to my Mac, its linked to Firefox. I suspect Firefox will have to do something to be compatible with Google Hangouts and Google Chat. </p>",mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1331248;1331364;1331508;1331747;1333897;,hangouts1004

1294151,2020-07-08 06:15:30 -0800,2020-07-08T06:15:30Z,Revert to previous PDF preview behaviour,"<p>Until recently, when I clicked on a pdf link, Firefox would load the PDF file as a preview, treating it (on the user end) much like any other webpage but with a download button available. If I then clicked on the download button, it would be saved in my downloads folder, and clicking the saved file in Firefox's download links would open it in my default PDF viewer (ie Acrobat). This allowed me to easily look at PDF files without cluttering up Firefox's downloads list, as well as quickly open a downloaded PDF in Acrobat. </p><p>Following a recent update to Firefox, these options seem to have been changed and I can't find a way to revert to the previous behaviour. It seems to be treating the in-browser function as a full PDF viewer, rather than a preview. I can set Firefox to open PDFs in Acrobat, but then it downloads every link I click on which happens to be a PDF and opens them all in Acrobat. Or I can tell it to open them in the browser, but then if I want to open a PDF in Acrobat I have to download it, then hunt for it in my downloads folder and open it there rather than directly in Firefox. It also clutters up my downloads list, making it harder to find slightly older downloads without going through file explorer. </p><p>Alternatively, I can tell Firefox to ask me what to do every time. This is a bit better (a new option ""open with firefox"" has been added), but still involves making a couple of extra clicks each time I open a PDF - and it still insists on downloading every PDF based link I click. </p><p>What makes this particularly strange is that the in-browser PDF viewer still has a ""download"" button, which has the traditional two ""open with___""/""save file"" options, even though as far as I can tell it will only display stuff it's already downloaded. </p><p>Is it possible to return to Firefox's previous behaviour, or is it gone for good? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",pi4toid

Every page I open it automatically scrolls through every scroll bar on the page. Thankfully most pages have only the one, down. However, if I get on a page with lots of iframes it will automatically scroll through each one of them in turn as well as scroll to the bottom of the page. I can't seem to interrupt this process until it's completed. Once it's done I can scroll back to the top, or correct any horizontal/vertical iframes and continue on as normal. </p><p>I've followed the instructions at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems</a> to no avail.

As a result, the <em>inside</em> of Firefox, websites themselves, are also scaled. My resolution is reported as 1536 x 864 pixels. In most scenarios, this isn't really a problem, since in theory zooming out to 80% restores a website's appearance to normal. </p><p>But while developing, it can be weird. For instance, when using mobile simulation mode. And the reflex of pressing Ctrl+0 to restore default appearance is deeply ingraned. Also when someone tells me there's a problem with the website at X zoom, I have to calculate what that zoom level is equal to for me. </p><p>So I'm wondering if there's something I can do, other than fiddle with zoom all the time, to see what my website actually looks like while keeping my interface enlarged. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Azma

I did and got 78.0.1 (64-bit) for Windows 7. Later I was deleting a program - winpdfeditor - in the Windows control panel and, at completion, suddenly got a message that Firefox was updating (again), but this time with a big bold warning - as I recall - that this version was not synched with anything. This new Firefox opened. My regular version, the one I'd updated this morning -- let's call it FF-1 -- was also open. In the second version (FF-2) I immediately checked under Tools &gt; Options &gt; Logins and Passwords, and the passwords section was empty. I closed FF-2. FF-1 is still open and still has all my passwords. I checked my Mozilla &gt; Firefox &gt; Profiles folder and now have two profiles - one called <strong>jn******.default</strong>, where I can see all my regular FF files, including logins.json, and one called <strong>i6******.default-release</strong>, with all files created today and no logins.json. Windows control panel also tells me I have two FFs, but identifies them as v78.01 and v72.02, and says both were installed today.   I just checked <strong>about:profiles</strong> and get this: ""Another copy of Firefox has made changes to profiles. You must restart Firefox before making more changes.""  What to do now?

Now, normally this wouldn't be a problem as the top of the screen would cut off any extra padding. However, using a program that reserves the screen edge shows that a maximized Firefox window indeed extends past the regular window border by exactly 8 pixels. </p><p>What's more, when using Windows Snap on two separate Firefox windows, one of the windows respects the screen edge while the other does not! This leads to the window control buttons at the top right of both windows to be in different vertical positions, which is difficult to use. </p><p>No other programs I have exhibit this behavior, which is why I'm turning to Mozilla support. I don't know if the issue has to do with the browser or how Windows 10 renders the desktop, but it throws off the design of the desktop as I intend to display it. </p><p>In the provided example picture, the left window demonstrates predicted behavior where the upper border of the window is at the position I intend (40 pixels from the true screen edge), while the right window can be seen extending past the left one by exactly 8 pixels. I have tried this with extensions disabled, in safe mode, and every other way I can think of and the problem persists. No other programs exhibit this issue.

Every time Firefox updates the tabs move up to the top of the browser, when I need them below the bookmarks bar, where they used to be. I did get instructions on how to do it for v. 72 (I think), but now I've updated to v. 78 and the tabs are again at the top. The instructions for changing the css: file go up to v. 74 only. Also, in the css: file I'm not sure how much of what's already there should be replace. The entire file? Or? This is probably frustrating for a whole raft of people, but for older ones like me (I'm 76) it's particularly maddening. I would appreciate any help I can get. Also, where would I submit my suggestion to Mozilla to just add a blasted toggle for moving the tabs back and forth. It would make a whole lot of people happy. BTW, I'm attaching a screenshot of the first page of what appears to be at least 8 pages of css: code. Should I delete all of it or...?

If I move it up even more not to the max but just up to say about 1/2"" the drop down window gets bigger however it is still cut down with no way to scroll down to see the rest of the window.

It seems to be triggered by the mouse scrolling wheel.  I have removed and reloaded Firefox but still the same, when reloading it recognises the previous instalation and recalls some previous settings, I don't seem to be able to stop this happening.

My standard browsing habit consists of launching browser with 1 pinned tab and 1 home page (so 2 tabs only), then opening 5-10 tabs from my bookmarks, checking pages then closing them and leaving only 1 pinned page open. In firefox 78.0.1 after doing this (opening and then closing multiple tabs ""to the right"" using new context menu added in 78) my ram usage does not drop. It goes from 2.4GB (system only usage) to 5.0GB and does not drop after closing tabs. However when I open 10-20 tabs again RAM usage does not rise (maybe slightly, like 5.3GB). So it looks like firefox has multiple tabs stored in ram and opening new tabs just rewrites that memory instead of allocating new one. I have 8GB of ram so 3GB of usage from 1 open tab is crazy. I think it was 500-900MB before. I also have terrible lags because of this - browser hangs up every few seconds for few seconds. I had trouble writing this post with 2 tabs open because of 3.3GB ram usage! Restarting browser helps - ram uasge rises from 2.4GB to 3.2GB only (800MB for 2 tabs) but every new opened and closed tab seems to stay in memory. For example if I open 10 more tabs except for 2 that always open so I have 12 tabs I have 3.6GB memory usage. After I close them it slowly drops to 3.5GB instead of returning to 3.2GB. It does not matter how I close tabs - using right click context menu (close other tabs, close tabs to the right), using X on tabs, or using add-on to close all tabs except for pinned ones. They always remain in memory somehow. PLS fix this ASAP. </p><p>P.S. I also tried checking about:performance menu but there is nothing interesting here. It says that 2 opened tabs and addons use 100MB of memory which is not true because browser at this moment uses 1060MB. </p><p>Update 1: I also tested safe mode. 3,4GB of PC RAM usage on firefox safe mode start. Opened few tabs, ram usage goes to 4.2GB. After closing all tabs except for 1 ram usage start to SLOWLY decrease but it stops at 3,7GB. Ram usage drop was really slow like 10-30 seconds. It should be instant after closing tabs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;e10s;firefox-780;e10s78;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1330827;1330829;1330833;1330836;1330846;1330850;1330852;1330954;1330955;1330980;1331143;1331148;1331432;1332404;,Piterk

But disabling all extensions and plugins in a normal window doesn't solve it. (I believe I understand private windows to use the RAM for caching but use the HDD under normal circumstances?) - Enabling/disabling VPN makes no difference, nor does what network I'm on, and other devices on this network have no similar issues - Other browsers on the same computer have no issues  - Malware, anti-virus, etc all are active and scan has been run a few times.  - Apple's hardware diagnostic turns up no issues, and this has happened now in FF over multiple of the latest versions (not sure when exactly it started) on two different Macbooks, though the new one is from an image of the old one (maybe that's something?) - Uninstalling/reinstalling FF does not make a difference  </p><p><strong>Where I'm at:</strong> The only thing that sort of worked (But it's now stopped working on certain sites, but continues to work for others) is moving FF's profile folder, uninstalling, and reinstalling. I was lead to believe FF would then create a new folder when this happened, but it just kicked up an error for me and wouldn't start. When I moved the old profile folder back and started up the freshly installed version with the old profile folder, the problems were all solved. Though as mentioned, they are starting to happen again on some of the sites. No errors or changes have been made that I can identify, plenty of space available on the HDD, etc.  </p><p>I've become a big fan of FF over the years (over Chrome), and want to stay in a privacy-focused browser, but I haven't been able to find much that seems to help this specific situation online.

What is the setting that will allow me to click on my bookmarked .lnk files (which in most cases open .html web pages) and open directly.

Whenever I need to restart my computer, I close my session, restart, reopen Firefox and it loads my entire session no problem. The neat thing about this is that when I do this, the tab title (along with the website icon) is preserved but the actual page only reloads when I switch to that tab. For example, imagine I have a YouTube video titled ""Programming in Python"", the tab would say ""Programming in Python - YouTube"" with the YouTube logo to the left of the title. There is definitely some kind of cache magic going on because say if that video was taken down on YouTube, the title would still be preserved until I switch to that tab. In my latest reloaded session, I noticed that tabs #250-500 failed to load the tab title and instead show the website URL with the icon I attached below. Is there any way to reload these tab titles without actually refreshing the page manually one by one (kinda like how Firefox does it on startup)? This is kinda how I navigate and it isn't helpful seeing just a URL. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-690;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1329407;1329408;,k2.t.cho

How do I know which instance will be restored? </p><p>Possible Feature Request: I don't know if multiple instances being started is self inflicted or a by product of some firefox operation encountered during use; I've not deliberately started separate instances.

I rotate ISPs regularly and have been at this shit since the WWW was invented and have even bought a Cisco router to host our own web site in the 1990s. I KNOW that the ISPs manage my connection speeds, router management software WILL be more capable than the Cisco router we managed ourselves!! I notice a similar profile of getting the speeds that are advertised at the start of a contract and then to throttle it as they add more customers to the same kit that they lease from OpenReach; increased latency! I also get OpenReach business notifications and know that the ISPs pay OpenReach for not only bandwidth that they use but also the electricity that powers them, OpenReach also charge for shit loads more but lets stick to the simples! ALL the ISPs deny ANY management function which is disengenuous to say the least!! There is a worrying trend in businesses to not only have no usable phone numbers (I had about eight BT numbers when we had the Cisco Router but NONE work anymore) due to the telephony shit that infests what laughly passes for customer service these days. {Thinks: Is there an undisclosed word limit to this field!?!?? I daren't hit return to go to a new para 'cause it might send like the excreble messaging systems which pass for comms in these benighted days!! My point for the designers of Firefox is: when I try to do ""Speed test I can count up to FIVE seconds before a Ping is registered which is never more than a 100ms so that's bollocks! Then it doesn't matter how many tabs I have open (often shit loads) the speeds that I get are independant and even when I'm ""listening"" to radio articles that doesn't effect the results either!
