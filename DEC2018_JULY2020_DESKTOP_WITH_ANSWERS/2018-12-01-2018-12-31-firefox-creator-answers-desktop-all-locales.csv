I could enter a number of characters, but after that,  I was done.   I could write, but when I pressed ""enter""  the comment just hung there.  It wouldn't post. </p><p>This morning I realized both problems had one thing in common:  Filling in a box and pressing ""enter"".   So I could eliminate that I was having just a Facebook problem, it had to be in the browser.   So reading my options in support, I launched Firefox in Safe Mode.   It works again!   I posted this on my Fb wall...so far no one else has told me they have the same problem.   Since I'm still in safe mode as I wrote this, the data collected is not showing the problem.

Close, but no dice. </p><p>I have Firefox set to just let me know when a newer version is available.  Several days ago, FF started advising of a newer version.  I put it off until about 27 or 28 December.  I did not immediately restart the browser as I was in the middle of something, but it was restarted within a few hours. </p><p>After clicking the restart button in the ""About Mozilla Firefox"" window, I got a UAC window, asking if I wanted to allow FF to make changes to the computer.  I was wary at first since I've never had this happen before just updating FF.  I clicked the ""Cancel"" button.  When I launched FF again a little later, that same UAC window appeared, once again asking if I wanted to allow FF to make changes to the PC, and again I clicked the ""Cancel"" button.  I then discovered that FF 63.0.3 had not been updated, and in the ""About Mozilla Firefox"" window, the button was still advising that FF needed to be restarted. </p><p>The next time I launched FF and the UAC window appeared, I clicked the ""Yes"" button.  However, this had no affect, as FF was still showing vs 63.0.3 and the button in the ""About Mozilla Firefox"" still indicated that FF had to be restarted. </p><p>I realize I can just download the latest version, but I do not want to lose all my settings - it seems that nowadays, replicating the same/preferred environment is not as easy as it once was.  I was going to try to restore to [a previous version] but that option was not available.  I then decided to try a system restore, but according to that process, FF would not have been affected - no doubt because the program was never really fully updated.  I don't normally allow updates so soon after a new version becomes available, and had I known this would happen, I wouldn't have this time.  Is there any way to force the FF vs 63.0.3 to update to vs 64.0, OR... stop the attempted and subsequent failure to update? </p><p>The PC has been shut down and powered up several times since attempting to update FF. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-630;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1184913;1185731;1185753;1216049;1216065;,FitAintBrkDntFxIt

My (initial) question is this: does this function PERMANENTLY minimize memory usage, or just for that session, or even just for that instance and it will then continue to consume memory after clicking the 'Minimize memory usage' button? </p><p>If it's only instantaneous or for the session, this does not solve the problem.

Let me give you some background first: </p> <hr> <p>Yesterday I finally did the Update to Windows 10 Version 1809 (Build 17763.195). As expected my PC was in an endless loop and couldn't log into my account, switching between a black screen and the login screen. I had the same problem on this PC before and undid the Update because of that. After having the same problem on my laptop and fixing it by booting into safe mode, where it finished the installation process I gave it another try on my PC. </p><p>After the update on my laptop 2 Programs made problems: Firefox, Kaspersky and Chrome. On my laptop I had problems with Firefox and Kaspersky, too, but I could solve them by reinstalling Kaspersky and reinstalling Firefox plus making a cleanup of the profile. Both programs work flawlessy since then (Mid2018). </p><p>After the update on my PC 3 Programs made/are making problems: Firefox, Kaspersky and Chrome. Chrome crashed on startup but mysteriously fixed itself without me doing anything to it. Kaspersky has problems starting. It won't start with Windows and doesn't always start when I click the shortcut. reinstall didn't fix it on this PC. </p> <hr> <p>Firefox crashes after I start it. I click the icon, as expected a window appears and before it has the chance to show any content it closes again and I get a message that it crashed. Here is one of the first reports:  <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/d49d0f06-2e09-44bb-88d5-d97bf0181227#tab-details"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/d49d0f06-2e09-44bb-88d5-d97bf0181227#tab-details</a> </p><p>Since then I found out some things: The problem seems not to be caused by Kaspersky, since it also happens when Kaspersky is down or not working. Firefox always works in safe mode. Restarting the PC and hoping for the best....didn't work.. Resetting Firefox it didn't work. Repairing Firefox it didn't work. Reinstalling Firefox it didn't work. Reinstalling Shockwave Flash (unfortunately I still need it) didn't work. Deleting all cookies did nothing. Deleting my Firefox profile workes until I install any addon. Then it crashes once I close it and try to reopen it. </p><p>So I think there are some rights missing somewhere. The crash report also says something about ""EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ"" </p><p>I disabled write protection on the AppData\Local\Mozilla folder and granted ""Everybody"" access to it. Even though my Windows User account has admin rights, I tried to start it as administrator. </p><p>That is all I tried so far. I know Microsoft is at fault, but I don't expect any useful and quick support from their side, so please help me ou here! </p><p>Edit: Just found out that when I want to enter private mode out of safe mode it also crashes (How I hate youtube wit ads...) It also crashes when I have a video in full-screen and leave full-screen. </p><p>Greetings </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-640;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1184797;1184801;1184802;,Schmiddy

Up to now I used Firefox Quantum 60.4esr on a Linux installation, but I thought it better to use an up to date win version. On my three page WordPress installation I am using a firewall plugin that lets me handle the frontend (Interaction user -blog) and backend (my interaction with WordPress core, themes and plugins) seperately  concerning CSP . I'm just starting out (newbie) and as I had read that unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval were dangerous I decided to hash the inline scripts used in the blog (script-src 'self'  'hash'  'hash'...;;) To accomplish this I used Google Chrome, ver. 71.0. At the outset Chrome complained about seven script tags, which I with help of the hashes reduced to two. </p><p>Turning to Firefox (cache disabled) I realized that Firefox doesn't seem to care about the hashes: Exactly those inline scripts that I had decimated as problems in chrome popped up again in Firefox, I admit Firefox rejected much more than just the hashes Files on my domain inserted as &lt;script src=""https://mydomain/.../file.js""&lt;/script&gt; becomes a returning problem,  also I would love to know how to handle onload or onerror or such that is embedded in &lt;link rel &gt; tags </p><p>To sum things up: Why the different behaviour concerning hashes between Chrome and Firefox? How to CSP a file src'd in a script tag if its on the same domain? How about events embedded in Link tags? </p><p>Hoping for a reply asuring you that I have done my best to solve this on my own.

If these browsers provided that function, why would Mozilla take it away? I tried using an Addon that sizes images, but it does not work inside of their application. Does seem to work if I just search for images, but inside the collaboration site it does nothing. They say their WYSIWYG editor controls the editing in all the applications on their platform, and I would think this would be a function of the editor, but they say it is not. They say Internet Explorer still has this function. I tried, and it does (so maybe they are telling the truth) but it does not work well.

I'm pretty sure I didn't install anything yesterday so I go to C:\Users\*****\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\****.default\sessionstore-backups to back up my sessionstore before closing and trying again. I do so and try to launch FF again and same issue. I replace sessionstore with the latest one from the backups (not my first rodeo so I just reflexively copy the biggest one to store on the D drive out of harms way) and I get the same ONE tab with the search engine. I've done this many times before (I have an embarassing amount of tabs open that I've been trying to sort through) so I know how to. But to spite the fact the sessionstore file is obviously large enough to have all my proper tabs saved it only opens 2 instances of the search engine and the options tab. </p><p>Out of curiosty I use an old ""previous"" file that was still on my D drive and that restores fine (only issue is it's over a month old and all the tabs I've closed and new ones opened are obviously no there either)  </p><p>I mentioned I just grab the biggest backup file (in retrospect I realise this is a bad habit) and I remember that the one I grabbed was .01 MB bigger than the others. There was no reason for it to be as they were all approximately created from the same time. I figure that it was these 2 new Ad-Aware search engine tabs.  </p><p>Anyhoo; long story short I need to know if there's any way to check or edit a JSON file to see if there's either a way to restore it or, failing that, to copy the web addresses to a new, open session. </p><p>I've tried:  </p><p><a href=""https://json-csv.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://json-csv.com/</a> </p><p>and </p><p><a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> </p><p>Also the only extensions I have are a tab counter and an alphebetizer though the second has been deactivated for a while </p><p>Thanks for any help </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-640;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1184094;1184112;1184114;1184118;1184131;1184132;,DorianOtten

Sync is really limited to the use case of ""all devices are equal"", and does not help manage multiple independent devices under a common account framework to manage them. For that matter, bookmark backup solutions don't address that either. </p><p>This will be especially true if ""smart devices"" plugged into TVs for display  (e.g. DVRs) can use FF as their browser for a UI. My nVidia Shield device has no reason to have access to all of my bookmarks/cookies - just the media/game related ones I choose for it to have access to. </p><p>As an analogy, LastPass can do something similar through what it calls ""identities"" (or possibly ""profiles"") within the same account which are basically tags on each entry. Each device after logging into the account, can be ""locked"" to filter only entries tagged with its current ""identity"", and thus does not see, or download any entries that are not tagged with that ""identity"". By ""locked"", I mean you can only change the ""identity"" (e.g. ""profile"") of a device by entering your password again. Entries can be ""shared"", meaning they have mutliple tags. The master ""all"" identity is the mandatory default and can manage what tags are applied to which entries. </p><p>Something like that would be slick for FF to have or add to bookmark capabilities and combined with Sync. </p><p>Thank you for your time and responses.

I know that there is an add-on which used to work until Mozilla broke it. I know that there were various flags in about:config, to Warn on Quit or Ask To Save on Quit, ALL of which have been disabled as of the current version (64 for Linux). I also know that there is an 'alternative' which is to Restore Session from the burger menu (and, BTW, for anyone who lost their work and then tried to fix the problem themselves, using their firefox browser, because that's what people do when they run up against an unexpected and annoying impediment to their work- Sorry, it's probably too late and that restorable session is lost now. But, hey, just remember that pain and change your habits - well, at least until the next breaking change when we ask you again to forget everything and take on our new way of doing things). </p><p>My question is not HOW to disable CTRL-Q, or how to mitigate the damage it causes. My question is WHY can't I disable CTRL-Q. </p><p>Or to put it another way - there seems to be a problem with the decision making structures at Moziila, in that they seem to be skewed towards removing user choices which don't happen to tally with how the developers think we 'should' be running the environment and user interface on our own machines. </p><p>It has been pointed out many times, over many versions of Firefox that placing a Quit shortcut next to the very commonly used Close Tab shortcut is crazy UI. I'm sure that some people find it very helpful and are happy to see others lose work by accident so that their quit shortcut in firefox is the same as in their other, fundamentally different, applications which are used in a different way (and which probably don't have CTRL-W shortcuts). I personally happen to think that the first is a very strong argument, and the second is favoured by the kind of people that favour order over humanity. But whatever - everyone is different. </p><p>It should at least be possible to choose remove a behaviour that a significant number of users find actively disruptive. There is no technical challenge to it. It seems to be political. Most users do not want to spend time googling the new setting each time a new version of Firefox comes out. Why remove Save On Quit and Warn On Quit? We knew these flags existed, but now they don't.  </p><p>OK, so you've made a shiny new feature which /you think/ makes the old flags redundant. But where's the problem with keeping them in anyway, and letting users decide /for themselves/ whether your shiny new feature is a suitable replacement? </p><p>And this happens time and time again. Why does Mozilla have to wait until there are enough angry users threatening to change browser before it accepts (and then only on a case by case basis) what every other tech company considers basic UX - don't pull the rug out from under your users. </p><p>People rely more heavily on browsers for their work than on almost any other type of application. If the browser changes from under users in ways which are often unhelpful, then that browser is encouraqing, firstly- users refusing updates and, secondly - users simply switching browsers. This is why tech companies in general place UX as joint first priority with functionality and, often, ahead of functionality. UX is an important thing. </p><p>I would love to blame this on some sideways profit motive or arrogance on the part of the developers, but those simplistic explanations don't cut it.  </p><p>So: Genuine question. Why do things work this way with Mozilla? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-640;,firefox,customize,en-US,1183045;1183048;1183059;,WhyDontTheyListen

The local directory profile that is used for caching can move with my new root directory profile or stay where it is- I don't care either way. It looks like if I were to delete my old profile, both root and local directory profiles would be deleted, and I would no longer have a local directory profile for caching associated with my new root directory profile.   Bottom line is perhaps how to create a new local directory profile for caching to work with my new default root directory profile.  See attached screenshot.

When a new FF window is opened, there is a white bar blocking the top of the window, from the top of the screen down to approximately the bottom of the address bar.  Alas, none of the answers have quite worked for me. </p><p>Though often simply described as ""white"" in other help requests, what I have is an area that while visibly opaque (white), is transparent to the cursor.  If another FF window is still open behind it, clicking anywhere in this bar will switch to that window and act there.  If no other windows are open, clicking there will open links on the desktop. </p><p>Some help requests have suggested checking for full-screen mode.  Pressing F11 to enter full-screen, then F11 to exit full-screen, does fix the problem within a single window, but the problem persists with other new windows, or if the program is closed and reopened. </p><p>Other help requests have recommended restarting in safe mode.  Doing so actually gave me an initial FF window with the white bar, though oddly only covering the left third of the top of the screen.  Given the problem appeared immediately in safe mode, I suspect it's not an addon.  Starting again out of safe mode does not change anything. </p><p>I have not yet tried the reset/refresh FF option; that, I suppose, is next, but I'm hoping to hear if there are other suggestions.

I don't have multiple devices, so where are all these bookmarks &amp; empty duplicate folders coming from.

This is a mess, and I really don't have time to read through a gazillion links trying to rectify this issue.  I've restored my bookmarks to before this latest update occurred, and it seems to be making things worse.  Mozilla needs to post BIG FAT FLAGS when they make a major change to this browser.  I would've never let this update install, had I known what it was going to do. </p><p>Because I embed folders inside of folders, all the loose ones used to belong inside of folders, and some didn't.  Now, I have tons of them where I can't find which folder they were in, because they were embedded.  This is really bad, whatever Firefox has done. </p><p>Again, 1 computer, 1 device ... WHAT IS IT DOING or syncing to?  I'm not using some Add-on to fix this, because an Add-on didn't break it; the last update did!  I do have Add-ons, but unless this version is incompatible with them, I have no clue.  None of them are bookmark Add-ons anyway.  I shan't Share Data this time, because I really don't want people poking around &amp; pointing fingers at my Add-ons.

PelissÃ¤ itsessÃ¤Ã¤n ei siis ole vikaa, vaan selvÃ¤stikin FlashissÃ¤. Muilla selaimilla (Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge) kyseinen peli toimii normaalisti. YmmÃ¤rtÃ¤Ã¤kseni Flash toimii nÃ¤issÃ¤ ActiveX:n kautta ja on siis kai sisÃ¤Ã¤nrakennettu, toisin kuin Firefoxissa? </p><p>Ongelma on se, ettÃ¤ pelin ""maailman"" (joka on rakennettu Flash Playerille) avaaminen - eli kirjautumisruudun latautuminen - ja siihen kirjautuminen ei toimi Firefoxissa. Flash kyllÃ¤ kysyy, ettÃ¤ kÃ¤ynnistÃ¤nkÃ¶ sen, minkÃ¤ teenkin. Siltikin ""maailmaikkuna"" nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ pelkkÃ¤Ã¤ mustaa, vaikka FlashiÃ¤ kÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤ animaatio pelin kotisivuilla toimii. Peliin kirjautuminen onnistuu Firefoxissa siten, ettÃ¤ kirjaudun ensin sisÃ¤Ã¤n joko Explorerissa tai EdgessÃ¤, ja ollessani jommankumman kautta kirjautuneena sisÃ¤Ã¤n, avaan ikkunan Firefoxissa. Ikkunan auettua ja kirjautumisruudun ladattua Firefoxissa voin sulkea IE:n/Edgen. Sitten vain kirjoitan salasanan ja klikkaan kirjaudu sisÃ¤Ã¤n -painiketta. TÃ¤stÃ¤ eteenpÃ¤in peli toimii niin kuin normaalistikin. Paitsi ettÃ¤ ei. Kun kirjaudun pelistÃ¤ (= ""maailmasta"") ulos ja lataan sivun uudelleen (poistaakseni vÃ¤lillÃ¤ lagia) tulee sama ongelma. Ruutu ei lataa, vaan pysyy mustana. Avaan IE:n/Edgen, kirjaudun taas sitÃ¤ kautta, avaan Firefoxissa, suljen IE:n/Edgen, kirjaudun Firefoxissa, peli toimii taas muuten normaalisti. </p><p>Pelin tukihenkilÃ¶kunnan mukaan joillain selaimilla on tÃ¤llÃ¤ hetkellÃ¤ ongelmia Flashin kanssa, ja ettÃ¤ se on jotain selainten ja Flashin vÃ¤lillÃ¤. Mahdollinen selitys (= valistunut arvaus), jonka he osasivat antaa on, ettÃ¤ Firefox ei ehkÃ¤ ole vielÃ¤ pÃ¤ivittynyt sisÃ¤ltÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n Flashin uusimman pÃ¤ivityksen. </p><p>Minulla on kÃ¤ytÃ¶ssÃ¤ Flashin uusin versio. Olen poistanut sen lÃ¤ppÃ¤riltÃ¤ni ja sitten ladannut uudestaan. Olen lukenut Firefoxin ohjeet FlashistÃ¤, sen pÃ¤ivittÃ¤misestÃ¤ ja mahdollisista ongelmista. MikÃ¤Ã¤n ei auttanut.

This is more of an issue for me now because I just recently improved my Internet enough to play videos at that resolution and not wait for them to buffer every few minutes. </p><p>I'm using the latest version of Firefox (64.0).  I tried disabling Hardware Acceleration, as was suggested, and I guess it's a bit better, but it's still dropping about 50% of the frames according to YouTube's ""stats for nerds.""  Others have said to alter Firefox's configuration, but when I tried to, Firefox warned me not to proceed unless I knew what I was doing, which I really don't.  Some have recommended installing various add-ons, but there's always someone claiming it doesn't help. </p><p>I've tried using Google Chrome to watch the same videos, but it causes my CPU to spike so there's constant choppiness anyway.  Microsoft Edge is the only browser I've used that seems to play these videos smoothly, but I'd rather not use it if I can help it.  I've used Firefox for years now.  I'm comfortable with it and it serves me well in most capacities. </p><p>I've seen others ask about this, but all the answers either haven't worked for me or leave me confused.

I'm sitting on my YouTube 'home' page and I see a set of 'suggestions'. I click on one of the suggested vids and watch it. Afterward, I hit the 'back' button in the browser (there is not an embedded back button in the app). Sometimes hitting the 'back' button takes me back to the same YouTube page with my suggested videos and I can watch another. Other times, hitting the 'back' button causes a new page to load and I now have a new set of suggested videos displayed. This behavior is not consistent - sometime the page load occurs, other times the same page appears. I cannot detect a pattern to this. What's annoying about this is that there may have been more than one thing I wanted to view on the initial 'suggested videos' section of the original page displayed. However, after watching one of the vids and hitting the 'back' button, if a new page loads, I now no longer have access to those other suggested vids I wanted to watch. As I noted earlier, I've seen this behavior in other apps too.  I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this, or if it's a browser thing at all, I'm just trying to understand what's causing this behavior and figure out if there's anyway for me to mitigate it. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;backbutton;firefox-630;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;probablynotafirefoxproblem;rolandff64experiment;,firefox,other,en-US,1182675;1182754;,khedger

I added a tab close button (hovered) colored background.  It's not necessarily same W x H as the inactive button transparent background - which is fine. </p><p>I'd like to move the (inactive) 'X' close to the tab right end (did move it - not necessarily easiest way). The bottom of red background in hovered state needs to be close to the tab bottom &amp; even with the tab's right end / side, for a better, easier target to close.  I did that - more or less.Â :) </p><p>The issue (that may have no solution) is the inactive button's transparent BG is 20x20px, I believe. So far, unless I make the hovered, colored background the same size as the inactive button's , it distorts the 'X' when the red background appears.  So the button is semi-fixed?  When hovered, it doesn't ""translate"" the X icon in the same HxW.   Yes, people are starving in Africa &amp; we're worried about pretty browsers. </p><p>I assume because the inactive close button has different dimensions and margins than the added background does, the only way I can get the ""legs"" of the 'X' near the tab border is enter different margins for it than for the hovered, colored background? </p> <ul><li> Question on the last part:  *When you have a 20x20 button, originally positioned so the 'letter X' was ~ 5 - 7px from the border / end, what does Firefox ""do"" w/ the transparent part of the button, when you enter margins so the 'X' is very near the right tab border (right end of the moz-box or container)?   </li><li> Does it in effect, 'remove' part of the transparent button, as different margins are entered, to move the button closer &amp; closer to the container's end? </li></ul> <p>It appears the default close button's 'X' is 10px WxH.  Since browser toolbox showed the button was 20x20px - I think, then it has a 5px margin? on all sides of the 'X'  image. </p><p>The main goals are: </p> <ul><li> 1. Get more room for text on tabs.  I also changed margins on the tab icons to move them near the tab left border &amp; disabled tab text fadein. </li></ul> <ul><li> 2. Have a clickable background  to close tabs - that lines up at the tab bottom, right corner &amp; not have to ""fish around"" for the close button.  I have that. </li></ul> <p>So far, unless I make the hovered background the exact dimensions of the button, then use the exact margins on both, it will distort the X - depending on how different in size the inactive &amp; hovered sizes are. </p><p>I couldn't find a CSS property / feature that would allow *the original* X close button to shift up or left (undistorted), when the hovered background appears. </p><p>Maybe the original close button could be hidden during hover and a new close button specified (adding a colored BG) with a new size?  Say, 15x20 (or 30)?   As long as the hovered BG is near the bottom, right corner. </p> <ul><li>  I think whatever space is occupied by the width of the transparent button edge (plus padding, if any), dictates how far the tab's text can extend to the right?  Once hovered, I don't care if more or less text shows, since I'll be closing  the tab, not reading it. </li></ul> <ul><li> If that's true, I could modify / create an overall smaller inactive close button - allowing more text on tabs.  Or just ""remove"" the *inactive state* close button, &amp; specify the same close button  (plus red BG) for the hovered state. </li></ul> <p>I'm not sure how hard it would be. </p><p>It was kind of tedious, figuring out how much negative margin values to enter (for 2 different element sizes), so they both wound up (nearly) equidistant from the tab R end.  Key word being ""nearly"".  I didn't want the 'X' touching or almost - the  tab divider line.  But I  want the hovered background touching it, to make an easier closing target.  </p><p>In blown up screenshot(sss), it seemed if I measured the distance between the close button visible 'X' and the tab's R border (say 7px), if I entered 5px, the visible 'X' moved, but NOT so it was 2px from the R border.  It seemed something else was affecting it. </p><p>.tabbrowser-tab .tab-close-button {   /* move inactive close button closer to tab R-end */ </p><pre> margin-top: 5pxÂ !important;  margin-right: -10pxÂ !important;  margin-left: 0pxÂ !important; </pre> <p>} </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;unsupported;firefox-630;userchromecss;unsupportedhacks;rolandff64experiment;unsupporteduserchromecss;,firefox,customize,en-US,1183120;1183143;1183369;1183399;,Joebt

I usually have problems with my browsers but this one has not fixed any of the problems I had before so I decided to bring them up now. I have reinstalled Firefox before and the problems still occur. I do not really want to install it again because I have around 31 extensions and 17 scripts. I have tried this on a fresh install and decided to ignore it but it's becoming more and more of a problem. </p><p>1. History, so when I put the settings to not put my history on the search bar it ignores the clicked setting no matter how many times I click and un-click it, so I made it so it would not save my history. That worked but it would not save my passwords, I have a account that I have to accept on my phone. And another where I have to get a special code. This is incontinent and does not give me options to change what it remembers and what it doesn't. Also when I turned it off it actually did remember all of my passwords and accounts.  </p><p>2. Videos, I had a problem with this back in 2013, 15, and 16 and it still happens. If I Maximize the window it starts to tear the video but if I go minimized it is fine, and if I full screen it is also fine. </p><p>3. Firefox account this one I just don't like it being on as soon as I login. </p><p>4. I've removed all the ""One-Click Search Engines"" I don't want and they keep coming back. </p><p>5. Some file types (even though I have the downloader option saved to ask me where to save) just save to some random folder in %appdata% that I can't actually get into said folder by normal means. So if I close the browser it just removes it because it's not in the Downloads folder its in a hidden folder that is hidden in other folders. </p><p>6. It saves all the search options in different websites excluding google because they have their own bad problems with google accounts.  </p><p>Now my question is, are these issues they plan to fix or is there a way I can fix any of these? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;probablynotafirefoxproblem;firefox-640;unclearquestion;jscherrocks;rolandff64experiment;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1180955;1180956;1180960;,ProButtModel

Linux,"<p>Hello, I am having trouble with Firefox not wanting to display fonts or text boxes correctly in some situations. I am providing two screen shots from a client bridge configuration page to illustrate the problem. One shot is of Firefox and the other is from the Chromium browser that came with Zorin. The boxes display perfectly in Chromium but, as you can see, there are issues in Firefox (font color is grey, font too big, box background transparent, box not large enough for text). I have tried playing with the font and color settings in preferences but all i managed to do was get the background of the text boxes to display white, unfortunately, this also caused many more appearance problems with other websites so i changed it back... I am using distro of Linux called Zorin OS 12.4. and a fresh install of Firefox 63.0.3.  </p><p>I guess I could use the Chromium browser instead, but I'm a big fan of Firefox and would rather use itÂ ;) ANy help would be much appreciate Thanks, Derek </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;webcompat;firefox-630;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;rolandff64experiment;zorin;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1181847;1182093;1182104;1182110;1182115;1182170;1182174;1182254;1182378;1182614;,Kingsnake

I'm stuck on Firefox 62.0.3 for now and I keep getting updtate warnings from Firefox and a beating heart banner on top of all my tabs but the reason I can't move up is Firefox itself.  And yes, I tried all the fixes I could find here before I posted my question. I update to 63 (even the most recent. 0.1 or whatever) and the exact same thing happen: Google, YoutTube and a Forum account I need to log into for work turn into blank pages. I get no error message, when I enter the address on the toolbar all I get is a blank page with nothing on it and the address bar showing (google, youtube and that forum site). Some websites work, like a news portal I look at, some don't, but, most importantly the triad I mentioned above doesn't, and I need them for work. They'll work on Chrome, Safari but not on Firefox 63. I turned off Ipv6 thinking this might be it (it wasn't), turned off Little Snitch (nothing changed), turned off BitDefender (still nothing), turned off hardware acceleration, accessibility stuff, you name it, I've done it. Then the moment I run the installer for Firefox 62 I'm back on all the sites, can see everything. No idea what this bug is and why is it is only happening on build 63 onwards, but something major changed between 62 and 63 and that something is what is giving me all this grief.

(At least 3 months ago; I remember stumbling on a reddit post from Sep 16th saying that it should be fixed with v63, which is why I waited to try it out.) It seems to be mostly with redirects, see examples below, but also with new sites: it seems to only auto complete after you visited a new site at least twice. I'm a fairly advanced user, so I'm quite convinced I've checked all possible solutions, like check settings in about:config, do a clean install, etc. Also, this behaviour has changed on both my computers and my new work pc. </p><p>I'm fairly certain it used to work like it still does in Pale Moon, which is my preferred method Examples: 1. If you go to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a> you're forwarded to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>. If you now close the tab and type 'ste' PM autofills it to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a>, Fx does not. It does suggest the page, but does not auto complete it (it does, however, autofill 'sto' to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>). </p><p>2. The same thing happens for <a href=""http://chrome.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chrome.google.com</a>, which redirects to <a href=""http://google.com/chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com/chrome</a> </p><p>3. <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a> forwards to <a href=""http://ikea.com/nl/nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com/nl/nl/</a>. PM autofills 'ik' to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>, Fx, again, does not. It _does_ auto fill to <a href=""http://ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com</a>, which is doubly annoying, because now you have to click 'to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>' every time. </p><p>So, is this change by design? Can and will it be fixed/reverted? </p>",desktop;other;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-630;autofill;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;rolandff64experiment;,firefox,other,en-US,1190236;1209730;,PeteSapai

I have repro'd it with the dark theme and with the pane docked to the right, but its been difficult to get it to repro in other conditions (clean profile, light theme, etc) since there is no obvious consistency in whether it occurs or not; sometimes it won't happen at all for a while, and sometimes it happens every other time I click a tab. </p><p>When it does happen, I've tried everything I can think of but I can find no way to restore the tabs, even by reloading the page, closing the developer tools, switching between panes, switching between DOM elements, trying every option I can think of, etc. except by closing the entire browser tab and opening another. Its infuriating. to say the least, and significant hit to my productivity in Firefox.

If I mark something as read, it remains unread and my unread amount does not change.  I have contacted Outlook via facebook, email and support and they have basically washed their hands of the problem and said it is Firefox. I have history, cache and cookies cleared every time I close the browser. My parents are also experiencing the same issue (Windows 10, Firefox and Outlook - I run Windows 7).

I will search up things and after an windows update I check firefox and there was almost no record of my browsing history for that day.  At first I had assumed maybe I wasn't very active but as of right now I can see this an issue.  Even if all the tabs are restored from last time it was open, Im basically walking on thing ice as im not sure if those open tabs are even being recorded unless I were to refresh the page on each one. </p><p>I tried the free recovery software recuva, but there were no missing files for 12/4/18  when I was on quantum  or really any in past 6 months in which I had this issue on the firmware right before it.

I don't understand why it would lose data even though it was already saved, which is why i asking here. There is a possibility the issue could solely be my on laptop but I doubt it. </p><p>Even when firefox itself crashes without outside factors, it would at least have the data recorded somewhere.  I stayed on the old firmware for awhile so i could use the session manager extension but it sometimes wouldn't save my sessions which is I why I had switched to quantum. the main benefit of  session manger is that it would save the tabs and the tab history like backspace, clicks on a page, form information, for example  typing in something into a search bar or forum post.

Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome did not have the certificate problem, but did have the message about the outbound trojan. I read several articles on the Firefox Support for the certificate problem and the Malwarebytes site about the outbound trojan.

The feed, on RSS Feeds application must be able to be manually deleted by me but as i said i haven't found free of charge application offering this.  </p><p>So I got different idea but not sure how to do it: Since websites have many (few hundreds) DAILY new articles/feeds posted, I would like to manually put on webpage some extremely easy and fast to be seen, while scrolling up and down, reminder (preferable graphical) which post was latest reviewed by me even if it goes to older page.  </p><p>So next time when i run Firefox or when i reopen the same website (webpage), i will see very soon which feed was reviewed by me as the latest one and from there i can go to next one which was posted later after the one which was latest reviewed by me. </p><p>This way,  i would not need to all the time write down the title which one was latest reviewed and every time search for it manually when i come back to the website next time. Particularly if that latest reviewed feed/post gets to some of older webpages, e.g. page 2 or 3 etc, i will save a lot of time not needing to search that feed. </p><p>I wonder if such firefox plugin or any other type of application exist? </p><p>Your answer would be highly appreciated, thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-630;,firefox,customize,en-US,1179374;1179378;1179379;1179380;1179384;1179391;1179395;1179397;1179402;1179404;1179425;1179429;1179434;1179438;1179440;,Dolphin0

But there appears to be no way to change the printer or its preferences (including the page dimensions) within the print preview window.  The print preview appears to use the same settings as the last time I printed something in Firefox.  So the only way to change the settings is to actually print something.  (or fake printing by printing to a file)  This renders the print preview function much less useful than it should be, as the scale and margin settings in print preview can only be effectively previewed when the correct page dimensions have been set.  This is a seemingly bizarre limitation that I've never encountered in other software.  Print preview isn't much of a preview if it only reflects my printer preferences *after* I print. </p><p>I tried changing ""print.save_print_settings"" to false in prefs.js and erasing all of the other print settings.  That prevented Firefox from saving the settings of each new print job, but it did not cause Firefox to read the currently set printer preferences from Windows.  It just made Firefox use some default preferences instead of the preferences I had set. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-630;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1179377;1179383;1179535;,balazer

Those with high latency, DSL connections probably suffer much much longer delays. </p><p><a href=""https://adprofs.co/beginners-guide-to-header-bidding/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adprofs.co/beginners-guide-to-header-bidding/</a> SNIP Header bidding is an additional auction that takes place outside of the ad server, in the header of a web page, which loads before anything else on the page. The header typically contains metadata about the page and calls scripts used for formatting the style of the page, tracking, and so on. Because of this, itâs an ideal area to conduct a new auction. </p><p>Even though this new auction happens in the visitorâs browser, the publisher essentially controls this auction. SNIP </p><p>Managing Header Latency One challenge of header bidding is the latency added to page loading. The header auction process takes longer than a typical RTB auction on a single exchange, which generally times out at 100 milliseconds. However, since many publishers use multiple exchange partners in a traditional waterfall setup, such latency has always been there. It just hasnât been in the header. </p><p>Header bidding asks for multiple demand sources to put forth their best price, so several RTB auctions happen simultaneously. As a result, publishers need to manage their timeouts so that no one partner will hold up the header auction and jeopardize page loading. Ideally, the overall timeout should be kept below 500 milliseconds, or half a second. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-520;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1179492;1179615;1180172;,VerizonSucks

Most vexing at the moment, part of the website I use to order items at work is not loading correctly. None of these issues exist while using Safari. I've tried: clearing history, mucking with the DNS settings, adjusting the proxy settings, re-installing Firefox.

I must admit I am using different versions of Firefox on different devices:  iPhone, Mac &amp; Linux at home and multiple Windows machines at work.

But my bookmarks it selves are missing their tags. The tags fields are empty. When exporting to an HTML-file, I don't see any tags either. Exporting to a JSON-file, disconnect my Firefox Sync profile, remove all bookmarks, re-import the JSON-file; doesn't do it either. I am becoming quit desperate, as this is over 10 years of bookmarking like a maniac.

So I was a firefox user and I used firefox sync. One day I downloaded a program that ive used for awhile but turns out I accidently hit express install instead of custom and it installed some crap which made ADW Cleaner or MBAM detect the Pref.js or profile.js as a PUP. It changed my default search engine in firefox. I changed the settings back to my search engine and I removed I think it was a toolbar that was installed. but a day later it was detected as a PUP again and my search engine was changed. Just so happens I needed a reinstall of windows so I did that. But I never reinstalled FirefoxÂ :( . Because of the file that was detected as a PUP, does firefox sync the pref.js or profile.js file to all devices? like make a copy put it on all devices so that my history bookmarks ect are on all my devices. I didn't delete my Firefox Sync account so idk why im asking this. I'm just a anxious person with somethings and I don't want what ever this threat was to come back.  It was a PUP so idk why im treating this like a Rootkit or Trojan in my mind.

I want to use the Home button for starting a new window of Firefox (Ctrl+N). Default page for Firefox is <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>. If I press the Home button while the window is not focused it opens a new window. If I press the Home button while the window is focused on it goes to the default page. So if I'm on any other page other than the default, I loose it, which I don't want. This used to work properly in Win7, but fails in Win10. </p><p>I also have a Microsoft Ergo 4000 wired keyboard which has a Home button. The button can be remapped/disabled by the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center. The default for the button is Start Web Browser. It behaves the same as the Home button on the airmouse. What I can do here is map the button so it starts a program. Setting it to start firefox.exe give me the result I want. Problem is this only affects the Microsoft keyboard. </p><p>Tried the following software: Key remapper Sharp keys Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator <a href=""http://Keyboard-layout-editor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Keyboard-layout-editor.com</a> KeyTweak MapKeyboard Key Mapper Key extender </p><p>Some did not see the Home key at all, and even the ones that saw it did not work. The only one that could remap to combination of keys is Key remapper, but does not work properly: I make the change to remap Home to Ctrl+N. This reactivates the Home button on the keyboard, even If I have it disabled. Pressing the Home button on the airmouse opens a new window, but also sends the old to it's default. </p><p>Can I change the firefox instead of going home to open a new window? </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-630;firefox-6303;,firefox,other,en-US,1178725;1178733;1179602;1181848;1182402;,JBR_02

I currently work for an online website as customer support, and the system that we use for taking chats and emails utilizes the auto-complete/auto-fill of Firefox, which is very handy for providing quick responses to questions that require the same or similar answers. I started in Nov 2017, and this worked well for quite a bit of time up until September or October of 2018. At this time, I noticed that that chat system we use would start to lag, or even freeze up and cause Firefox to become Non-Responsive. After a bit of investigation, we figured out that it was the Firefox Auto-Fill/Auto-Complete feature that was causing the issue. After clearing Form/Search History, Cache, and Cookies, the issue seemed resolved. There was no longer any lag in the system, and everything was running normal. However, after 3-4 weeks, the same issue has occurred, where the system lags due to the auto-fill responses. </p><p>I am not sure what entirely is causing this issue, or what has caused it to suddenly happen after 8-10 months of it working perfectly fine. The only thing that I can think of is an update around the time that has caused this issue to come to light. Not sure if there is something that can be done on my end, or something that can be done with another update to resolve this issue and prevent it from occurring in the future. </p><p>And just as an additional note, this is not isolated to just one website. Any website that I go onto that utilizes Firefox Auto-Fill/Auto-Complete has visible lag when attempting to utilize it the auto-fill/auto-complete. </p>",desktop;other;escalate;windows-10;firefox-630;autocomplete;autofill;autofillhang;firefox-6303;,firefox,other,en-US,"",XioGShep
