Where did the Bitdefender Wallet Add-on go? Mozilla updated my browser (it's set to auto update) and it deleted my Bitdefender Wallet add-on for some reason which kind of really sucks. The rub is that Bitdefender Wallet is no longer findable when I search the Mozilla add-ons which is weird, only some useless themes pop up. I need to reinstall it as soon as possible to get up and running again. Bitdefender seems to think it should be available in the add-ons manager but nope, not there. </pre> <p>Help a brother out? </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",summerwinterfall

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, GNOME 3.28.2 with a 64-bit OS.  </p><p>Recently, I noticed that I could not save PDFs from the internet to my hard drive when I was using Firefox. Normally, if I had opened a PDF in Firefox, I could press 'Ctrl + S' on my keyboard and a save dialog window would appear. Now however, the save dialog window would not appear. No error messages appeared, so I have no screenshots to show. The only thing I could do to save the PDF was to click on the 'Download' icon in Firefox's PDF reader. Right-clicking on links to PDFs and selecting 'Save As' would yield the same result: no save dialog window, nothing. </p><p>I thought that the problem might be because my version of Firefox was not up to date, so I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install firefox' in the terminal. I also updated the flash plugin.  </p><p>Afterwards, I noticed that I could not upload files from my hard drive as an attachment for e-mails. I tried this on different websites and had the same problem. I tried the solutions described on the following pages, but none of them worked.

The problem remained.  </p><p>Then, I uninstalled the 77.0.1-1 version from the Snap Store and reinstalled the 77.0.1+build-1-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 version from ubuntu-bionic-updates-main. This resolved the problem. I can now save PDF files by pressing 'Ctrl+S' on my keyboard and i can upload files.  </p><p>I'm reporting this because I think other people might encounter the same problem as I did. Also, if it is possible, I think it would be better to coordinate with the people who maintain the Ubuntu software packages so that only one version of Firefox appears in the 'Ubuntu Software' program, instead of two. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;linux;solved;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1322845;,hancheng.lie

But when I tried to use Firefox to play videos (for example, from <a href=""http://nicovideo.jp"" rel=""nofollow"">nicovideo.jp</a>), it gives me an error message. I tried some streaming sites, but apparently only Youtube that worked without problem. Another problem that I encountered is Google Play Music website requiring me to install Adobe Flash Player to play musics. </p><p>Some things that I've tried so far but failed to solve the problem: </p> <ol><li> Disabling Firefox hardware acceleration. </li><li> Uninstalling all add-ons. </li><li> Uninstalled and re-installed Firefox. </li><li> Started Firefox in safe mode (running firefox -safe-mode in terminal). </li></ol> <p>Additional informations: </p> <ol><li> Usually I use Firefox on my ASUS TUF (my OS is also Ubuntu 20.04) for almost all of my internet needs including playing videos and listening to musics. It works just fine with the same setting (I sync my Firefox across all my devices). I remember didn't do anything special to set the Firefox on my ASUS; I just use the pre-installed one and the videos and musics are playing just fine. The software I installed are also pretty much the same. </li><li> On my Dell, I tried to play videos and Google Play music using Google Chrome, and they work just fine. The videos are playing and Google Play Music didn't require Adobe Flash Player. </li><li> Solutions provided here ([<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1208656"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1208656</a>]) didn't work. </li><li> I installed Lubuntu and Xubuntu 20.04 on top of my Ubuntu, and all video streaming site and Google Play Music worked on both distro's Firefox.

Tis a relief :) </p><p>So the article above says to check this list @ <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements</a> for ""required libraries"".   I am really good at the command line except for checking library dependencies. :/ </p><p>Last link shows these 5: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item    GTK+ 3.4 or higher </li></ul> <pre>   * Bulleted list item    GLib 2.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    Pango 1.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    <a href=""http://X.Org"" rel=""nofollow"">X.Org</a> 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended) </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item        libstdc++ 4.7 or higher </li></ul> <p>My fear is i'll have to search around a while for the exact package name since sometimes capitalization and dashes matter when using apt, aptitude, or synaptic. </p><p>Here's what I am trying so far.   I started with libstdc++ since that's all lower case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $ apt list | grep libstdc++ | grep -v unstable ... ... (super long list of lots of different libstdc++) ... libstdc++6/stable 8.3.0-6 i386 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So since that ends with version 8.3 and that's higher than the ""4.7 or higher"" in the official list above, then I'm good. (By the way, just a plain `apt list libstdc++` returned no results.) </p><p>And substituting the word 'pango' in the above command gives a similarly long list that looks good, i think. Same with 'gtk3', 'glib2', and 'xorg'. </p><p>Oh, i think i've answered my own question :) but maybe went the scenic route with my command since i did not know the exact package names. </p><p>Anybody have a faster way of checking for these?  Pretty please? :) </p><p>P.S. By the way, I'm using Debian but in my experience it wouldn't matter if i was using Arch or even one of the BSD's right now.  Yes, tools are slightly different like apt/dpkg, or ports but am mostly curious for what exact package names to search for to save me time. :) </p><p>Thanks, you all rock.

Mozilla Firefox becomes very slow for Google-based services (Google Search, Gmail, YouTube) and unresponsive when HTTP3 is enabled in about:config. Since QUIC is mostly a Google invention and Google services are the ones that utilize it the most, I wonder if Google deliberately slows down Firefox-based QUIC. The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services. There are other non-Google QUIC services and they are actually faster/quicker with Firefox HTTP3 flag enabled. That again makes me wonder if Google deliberately creates an HTTP3/QUIC problem for Firefox... </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321944;1322010;,ponomarc

In this version, but also all the previous versions, I have a problem while scrolling long web pages. Once I have scrolled down quite a bit to far below the immediately visible area, there will be a horizontal area across the entire browser window that does not show anything or is blacked out. It appears as if that area is covering up the info below it (as in a lower layer).  If I continue to scroll further down, these blacked out areas appear regularly. This forces me to switch to another browser (Chrome, Edge) where the problem does not occur, just so that I can read that info or access the buttons etc. hidden in FF.  I am working with a Lenovo Laptop attached to a docking station and two extra 27 inch screens that are turned to vertical and stand side by side.  The attached Screenshot gives you an idea. It was taken from this page: <a href=""https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/</a> with the parameter for number of items to display in the table below the map set to ""Alle"".

And the problem is also unrelated to a specific website.

I have been a dedicated user Firefox browser for years, and one day it comes to a grinding halt.  Not sure how or why this happened.  Did someone have a bad day, and decided that that was the day that every Firefox user had to have a password to use the software?  I lost all my bookmarks because apparently my password (which I did not have) was the only way to access them and resetting my password meant of course they are gone.  Really sad, as the Chrome browser is a pig - why does EVERY web site you ever accessed have to stay open?? Weird!!   Is there a description somewhere of how to navigate the new Firefox.  I have tried to get somewhere using the 3 boxes that open in the initial screen but they are dead ends.  Odd but then most of the stuff I see is ""Intuitive"".  I will be 75 in a week, so I don't do intuitive!!  Help.  Jim  </p><p><em>[Personal information removed by moderator.
