I made a new profile, then copied 11 files from a backup of my profile into my new profile folder, following these instructions <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile</a>    </p><p>Most things came right back, that is very nice. </p><p>I am not certain if browser cache is disabled, which is necessary to avoid insanity while making changes to websites, which is what I do all the time.  My mental defects did not prevent me finding thousands of web pages explaining how to complete this task.  However, my mental defects prevented me finding any explanation created since the formation of the internet (I am estimating the internet first formed in 2008, because the dates of the answers I found indicated as such (anything before 2013 is basically the same as 2008 for internet purposes).  And so, I am here to beg a moment of your time to help me resolve this risk to my mental health which will be extremely serious if caching does not discontinue its anti-social activities. </p><p>LEST YOU THINK I AM HELPLESS I found my way to about:config, entered cache into the search and up came about eighty various cache, assundry and other forms of affiliated/associated items.  The list is diverse, but every item on the list has one very special thing in common with all the others, and as a group, they achieve an astonishing feat.   </p><p>WHAT THESE configs HAVE IN COMMON All eighty configs produce by the procedures above have the letters c-a-c-h-e somewhere within them in that precise sequence, with no intervening or otherwise contrary letterizations. </p><p>THEIR COLLECTIVE FEAT They manage to organize themselves to perfection, including among them every single config containing the letters c-a-c-h-e in that exact order.  No slackers calling in with covid or excuses of dogs eating their homework, all do their part in the roll call when its taken this way.  This kind of character is exemplary and inspiring. </p><p>THE PROBLEM I attempted to calculate how many combinations of values these eighty configs can have.  I got as far as determining a penny for each combination would amount to more than 400 times the gross product of economic activity since the dawn of recorded history. </p><p>STRATEGY Since trying every combination is too time consuming, my goal is to go straight to the correct config adjustment to send the cache away. </p><p>HYPOTHESIS Changing the last item on the list, marked 'cache' from TRUE to FALSE will produce the cacheless experience I must achieve in order to not impersonate a Molotov Cocktail. </p><p>The attached image shows what I have in mind.  I am going ahead with experiements, but my hope is someone with knowledge will help click this thing in the way it should go. </p>",firefox-770;tips;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,tips,en-US,1319622;1319737;1319756;1320348;1320352;1320354;,firefox195
