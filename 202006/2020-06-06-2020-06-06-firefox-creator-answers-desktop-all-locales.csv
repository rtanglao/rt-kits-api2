Someone from this forum helped by guiding me to a userChrome change and a userContent.css file.  That worked fine and the tabs were below the address bar. </p><p>The next time I upgraded Firefox to 75 I think it was, the address bar wasn't working the way it used to. I wanted to be able to have the whole address bar selected when I clicked on it so I could type over what was there and enter a new address.  Again, someone on this forum very kindly helped me by showing me how to change the settings on browser.urlbar.OpenViewOnFocus and 3 others and the problem was solved. </p><p>Now I come to Firefox 77 and the tabs are showing above the address bar again AND the address bar is no longer working as I wanted it to. </p><p>The OpenViewOnFocus settings are the way they I was advised to change them, but the tabs are still above the address bar.  Someone acknowledged that changing the OpenViewOnFocus will no longer correct the tab locations and suggested a userChrome.css change.  But I've already got one program in the userChrome.css file that I used the fix the address bar program. </p><p>Can I have two different programs in the userChrome.css field? </p><p>If so, can anyone help with the userChrome.css program that would take care of both problems? and do I still need the userContent.css file? </p><p>Why does Firefox keep doing this? </p>",firefox-770;tabs;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1321003;1321017;,mikejanus

It outputs in the millivolt range. </p><p>This was driving me crazy, until I diagnosed what was causing it. </p><p>Viewing a web page, I'd immediately get FM interference, making the streaming FM audio, raspy and unlistenable, as soon as I clicked the ""reader view"" icon on the toolbar.  Sometimes, I could click the icon again, to revert to the ""normal"" web page view, and the interference would stop.  And clicking the icon to return to ""reader view"" again, the sound was O.K. </p><p>Other times, I'd have to close the tab entirely (which stopped the interference) allowing the streaming audio on the other tab to continue without interference.  I could then open the tab on the ""offending"" site again, and the audio was O.K.  I'd just continue with this tab in ""normal"" web page view. </p><p>Now, I know there are folks ""out there"", who are just as nerdy as I am, who are curious about how ""reader view"" is causing FM interference.

But on Windows machine its battery performance is very poor as compared to Chrome. Firefox almost swallows the whole battery in 1/3rd of the time as compared to Chrome. It is very much consistent on Windows machine. I tried usual tricks of uninstall/install, disabling of add-ons etc. It doesn't seem to be my environment issue. Facing this issue since last year when I resumed using  Windows. This is preventing from using Firefox on Windows and eventually on all platforms.  Appreciate any help/hints.
