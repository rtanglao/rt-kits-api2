You can just assign an application such as VLC player to a specific file type (In Firefox -> Options -> General -> Applications you can choose which file type is opened with which application). But whats the technical difference between VLC installed on operating system level and VLC as a web-plugin of Firefox? Both are external programs (locally installed) started from within the browser. I know, that it is the goal of web2.0 to get rid of the plugins, as they are security risks and not user-friendly. However, what is the difference if I can assign an external program to render the file? Is it maybe, that only the plugins such as flash and shockwave can change the html-code on the client side and make the website interactive (and more insecure)?

Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"".
