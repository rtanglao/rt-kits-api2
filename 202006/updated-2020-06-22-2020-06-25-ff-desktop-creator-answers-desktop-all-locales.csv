This issue can’t be caused by Google alone, because every Gmail account works perfectly on my roommate’s computer, on my smart phone and on my computer if I use Internet Explorer (which I haven't used for years). Yahoo mail, does interestingly, as will all other non-Gmail accounts, work flawlessly with Firefox. Perhaps the flaw is solely with Firefox when it handshakes with gmail's security protocol, because error code #2005  is what always pops up. Another error message says that Hangouts has not been signed in. And while I do have 2 phone numbers for two Gmail accounts, Gmail also signs me out of 4 other accounts that have no phone numbers.  </p><p>Here's the list of troubleshooting steps attempted recently. If at all possible, I'd like to avoid resetting Firefox, unless I can see from your provision of the entire list of settings, what will be lost. Thank you, for your expert advice. </p><p>1.

But I moved from my home town some years back, and I fortunately found out, that the Funeral Home there, offered email alerts when someone passed away. Some alerts, had special Memorial Video's of the deceased along with their family. It's very nice that as we age, occasional Obituaries would bring back special memories to some of us. I switched to Firefox some time back, as I was tired of dealing with Chrome all the time, and this is what I discovered: In Chrome and Firefox both, the email alerts are based in HTTPS:, and are of the MP4 video format. They play just great, in Chrome, but in Firefox, the area inside an Obituary Alert, where the video is located, ONLY HAS A BIG BLANK SPACE, that shows nothing at all. The MP4 Video, is not present. This Obituary, is what I am speaking of -  <a href=""https://www.vincentfuneralhome.net/obituary/john-herpin-sr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vincentfuneralhome.net/obituary/john-herpin-sr</a>, who is the father of a friend I graduated with.

It started when I started to use the [win key] + [arrow keys] to split my screen into 2. The thing is that it will remember the side it was last session, left or right; but it won't remember anything related to size. So every time I open Firefox I will have to manually maximize it which gets old pretty quickly. If I create a new profile it will magically work again but after logging in and importing my settings, bookmarks, etc, it will go back to the same problem. I have already tried reinstalling, disabling extensions and deleting xulstore.json (as well as getting the one from the new profile and replacing the old one).

In fact it runs wild and is difficult to stop. In the Options&gt;&gt;Application I have mailto set to Use Microsoft Outlook just as it was before the reinstall which worked correctly.  Now what happens is it gets itself into a never-ending reiteration or opening a new tab in FF, which then does something to open a new iteration of Outlook with the legend Navigation to the webpage was cancelled as shown in the attached screenshot. This somehow manages to open another new tab in FF and so on and so forth, until I manage to stop it.

I use Adblock Plus and have pretty much since I first became aware of the extension way back in the day. However today I have noticed white screens popping up on Youtube on certain videos, which seem to indicate they are ads. I have the option to skip them before they even play, but I shouldn't be seeing this at <em>all</em>, so far as I'm aware. I certainly haven't seen it until this evening...or I guess it's now early Tuesday morning as I post this. Is anyone else having this issue, and if so, is Adblock Plus aware of it? I've been very happy with Adblock Plus, and I'm genuinely worried about what this means for them. Can anyone help explain why I'm seeing this? I am including a screenshot of the phenomena. </p><p>Bear in mind up till about ten minutes or so prior to this post, I have <em>never</em> seen this. The videos would normally play as they should without ads or this odd screen whatsoever. In fact, some videos still <em>do</em> play without this screen popping up at all. This is why I'm a little worried about this.

I need both browsers for different programs (scan and to deposit checks, and Mozilla to manage photos in my website).  I never run the browsers simultaneously.  When I use Firefox, all is well until I suddenly see a blue screen with a bunch of printing.  The screen does not last long enough for me to read everything, but it does mention if this is not the first time I've seen this screen, I am supposed to do something with BIOS chaching or shadowing.  I have NO idea what this means or how to do this, as I use my computer for basic, simple programs.  I haven't downloaded any new programs, and have been reluctant to download new Firefox patches since the blue screen seemed to happen more frequently after updating Firefox. I've scanned for viruses, and have also run chk dsc, to no avail.  This never happens when I use IE11, only when I use Firefox. If someone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it.  However, please don't tell me to get W10.  I don't care how wonderful this OS is supposed to be, I cannot use it.  My one laptop with W10 has only been used once and I refuse to use it.

The problem is that not only don't we use it, but almost no US online forms are designed to accept it.  Virtually every form on any website in the US is set up to expect a TEN DIGIT phone number without any area code.  This is especially true of forms for businesses that only do business with customers in the US. </p><p>I have rarely found any online form in the US that <em>needs</em> the country code -- exactly the contrary I have found numerous online forms that fail when Firefox attempts to enter a phone number with the +1 area code.  Some forms reject the + as a non-numeric character.  Other forms reject the entire phone number entry for having too many characters.  Probably most common are forms that take the numbers as being a standard 10-digit phone number which the form truncates at just 10 digits (cutting off the last one or two digits that Firefox sends).   </p><p>The <strong>fact</strong> that most online forms in the US cannot process a phone number with any country code seems strange considering how many of our web coders are international workers on H2-B visas - but it is absolutely true that most of our online forms <em>cannot</em> process a phone number of more than 10 digits. </p><p>I always enter the phone number as just the 10 digits, but Firefox insists on adding the +1, even when I edit the saved address to remove the +1 Firefox will soon add it again. </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",n4aof
