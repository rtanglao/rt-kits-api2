It just adds a `(1)` suffix to the filename automatically.  However, in Firefox, it asks me to type a new file name if the directory contains a file with the same name. Is there any under-the-hood switch to fix this behavior? ( BTW my download option is set to  ""Save files to Downloads without asking me every time"" ) Sounds like a simple problem but imagine you need to download 100 images from a web page and every file on the server is named `image.jpg`. </p>",tips;desktop;firefox-760;windows-7;,firefox,tips,en-US,1318904;,taseron

But whats the technical difference between VLC installed on operating system level and VLC as a web-plugin of Firefox? Both are external programs (locally installed) started from within the browser. </p><p>I know, that it is the goal of web2.0 to get rid of the plugins, as they are security risks and not user-friendly.
