Now I found two bugs: </p><p>Gateway timeout: While developing I got a gateway timeout for an endpoint of my current project. In the console this is correctly logged but in the network monitor I don't see anything. This is quite confusing. The console log looks like this: </p><p>ERROR Error: ""Uncaught (in promise): S: {""headers"":{""normalizedNames"":{},""lazyUpdate"":null,""headers"":{}},""status"":504,""statusText"":""Gateway Timeout"",""url"":""https://myurl.myurl/profil"",""ok"":false,""name"":""HttpErrorResponse"",""message"":""Http failure response for https://myurl.myurl/profile: 504 Gateway Timeout"",""error"":null}"" </p><p><br> Replaying request: Very useful feature, however it seems to have an issue with Authentication headers. When my angular application does a service call it works fine. When I then replay this request I get the response of the backend: 401 you are not logged in. Upon closed inspection I printed out the headers in this response and noted that after replaying the request the header ""Authentication: Bearer ...."" is missing. </p><p>Any hints how to fix these issues? </p><p>Also is this the correct space to report issues/bugs?

I'd just like to understand. </p><p>A few years ago, it was necessary to install a plugin in order to playback a video (for instance the VLC-web-plugin). Nowadays, plugins are not necessary. You can just assign an application such as VLC player to a specific file type (In Firefox -&gt; Options -&gt; General -&gt; Applications you can choose which file type is opened with which application). But whats the technical difference between VLC installed on operating system level and VLC as a web-plugin of Firefox? Both are external programs (locally installed) started from within the browser. </p><p>I know, that it is the goal of web2.0 to get rid of the plugins, as they are security risks and not user-friendly. However, what is the difference if I can assign an external program to render the file?

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;,ji.perez.marturet

I don't even have it installed.  I don't want it installed.  The computer freezes for a bit and finally gives up and tells me something about the program not being installed or set up properly or whatever.  I've forgotten what it said.  Anyway, afterwards, the right-click ""Save Image As..."" and possibly other options don't work until after I reboot the computer.  I will NEVER right click an image to e-mail it.  I do that from my mail program.  How do I remove the option from the right-click menu.  I tried looking it up, and found a lot of related stuff but they proved unhelpful. </p>",customize;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1318117;,gbeacock
