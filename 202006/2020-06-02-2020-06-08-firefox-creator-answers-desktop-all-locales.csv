I can no longer use Firefox to pay online with StateFarm.  This started suddenly a few months ago. I had no problem navigating to the payment login page with State Farm, then one day I clicked the link and received an error page. I called State Farm Technical service and they suggested I try another browser.  It works fine in Chrome.  I like exclusively using Firefox.  Can this link be made to work on Firefox again? 2.  All of a sudden Firefox stopped opening links in webpage.  It doesn't open a new tab, it doesn't open Adobe Acrobat.  All I get is a flash of the download arrow.  I then need to go through multiple steps to download/open/save whatever it is I'm looking for.  If I don't see the flashing download arrow, it just looks like nothing has happened.  I'm assuming this change came in some update recently.  I have looked in options, but don't see how I can reset the options so links open automatically.   3.  In Options, I noticed a banner iYour browser is being managed by your organization.  I use Avast.  Your article about this suggests turning off Avast for web browsing, but that is advice in direct opposition to my computer guy.  I don't care about the banner if I know why it's there.

1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,2020-06-08T12:02:11Z,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"<p>I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"". This comparison exemplified that resource consuming from inside and outside looks very different. The second conclusion is that network usage ten or more times lower than disk usage, which should not be even if content is unpacked and saved. And the main question is why disk usage are close to memory consuming. This speaks in favor of the fact that disk usage is inefficient and surplus: most data can be stored in memory. Let's consider the attached screenshots. The first part of screenshot 'Firefox external metrics@77.0.1' consists of two parts with ProcessHacker window and contains the following external metrics of the parent firefox process: </p> <ul><li> Working set = 2 GB (summed over children processes) </li><li> Virtual size = 3.25 GB </li><li> Network total bytes = 287.1 MB </li><li> Disk total bytes = 3.02 GB </li><li> Disk write bytes = 2.48 GB </li><li> Disk read bytes = 551.23 MB </li></ul> <p>The firefox process structure is in the second part of that screenshot. The same observation -- excessive resource consuming exemplified by the same metrics. To estimate total memory consuming, I closed Firefox and compared memory usage by ""System information"" (ProcessHacker's tool): the commit charge level decreased by 4.2 GB and the physical memory level decreased by 2.7 GB. This means that 1.5 GB memory pages are in the paging file, i.e. stored on the disk! In comparison with Windows 7 memory consuming, we see 748 MB versus 2.7 GB in physical memory. Does Firefox indeed execute so many tasks and provide so many functions and deliver so much value as Windows 7 Pro operating system? The comparison Firefox versus MS Word 2010 with 20 opened documents (about 200 MB RAM consumed) leads to the same observation: the former has much higher resource consuming per functionality/value. </p><p>However, Firefox's ""about:cache"" and ""about:performance"" don't report such resource consuming: see the according screenshots. I summed memory usage by web pages enumerated in ""about:performance"": all 16 loaded web pages consumed 522 MB in total instead of 2.7GB physical memory and 4.2 GB virtual memory. What does Firefox really do?! This is why I suppose that Firefox executes hidden extraneous tasks. To those who would like to analyze Firefox's memory report in detail, I saved and published it: <a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg</a>  </p><p>My point is that disk I/O operations should be decreased significantly in order to prevent Firefox from hanging and to decrease response time on user actions. There are several measures to do it. First, stop using RAM in uncontrolled and ineffective manner as we saw it even on 16 web pages. This means estimating and measuring memory overhead per content byte, per user-level function and per delivered value. Second, stop using disk-based databases, use in-memory databases instead. Third, use effective data structures and data architecture. To prevent memory page unloading, use OS API to disallow unloading of desired memory pages using proper attribute. Yes, if your data/programming languages do not satisfy these critical requirements, use another one. If your data/programming technology do not satisfy these critical requirements, just change it. If your values interfere with this approach, then make the browser’s mission to be the main value -- visualizing hypertext to the user quickly, cheaply, conveniently and effectively. All other values around it have lower priority, remember! No one need safety and transparency and so on if the browser hangs with other process in the system or web page loads more than 0.5 second on a real device. This means you should not suppose the modern or superpower device -- you should suppose any device with one CPU of 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM. These resources are enough to display even 100 pages of 1 MB each in size, obliviously. Just because 1920x1600 = 3072000 bytes (one byte per pixel), i.e. about 3 MB per screen image.

Now this doesn't happen when in normal mode meaning not in picture in picture mode, So basicly i'm saying could you guys look into making picture in picture full screen mode not make the screen go to sleep like in a normal player, I understand I can also turn off picture in picture mode or turn my screen auto turn off after a few minutes off but I would think it would be much better if the picture in picture full screen mode worked the same as watching something in a normal player which doesn't make your screen turn off, Not sure if its a bug or was just over looked either way thought I would let you guys know. Also want to add that picture in picture mode is a great idea, I have always wanted to beable to watch something while working when only having 1 screen and picture in picture works great for that keep up the good work! Hope you guys understand what I'm reporting here thanks. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;pictureinpicture;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321705;1322058;,batboy775

Literally after an hour of this trashbar being up, videos and guides popped up to try to fix it.

My question is, looking through google has only come up with the chrome.css(?) fix to this mess.

I saw that setting ""browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests"" to ""true"" might be the solution but, while it does stop the address bar from expanding when using it, it also stops it from expanding at all so the websites that would come up from searching can no longer be seen either (they are still called and using the down arrow will let me scroll through the results, I just can't see any of them). It also doesn't fix the results issue which I would say is the most important. </p><p>I would like to know what I need to do so that: 1. The results it shows me are no longer based on frequent visit (basically, the pre-update search system, as is they are scattered and look messy, pulling many different sites in a seemingly random order and it's not particularly useful) 2. It no longer autocompletes results (IE. ""F"" autocompleting to ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"", this is always something that has bothered me regardless is context) 3.

For almost a month, and with great diligence and frustration in trying to troubleshoot this a couple of different ways (according to Mozilla and others)), nothing has prevailed.  </p><p>Could it be the great number of open windows and tabs that cause it, because that is my last (but not yet tested theory).  Most of the times the sign out occurs when the email draft automatically saves itself, and the site disconnects. How I know this, is gmail says it's trying to reconnect. There's also a message saying my hangouts isn't signed in, but neither is it signed in with Chrome  One more thing. Every day for the last 3 years, I use CC cleaner to remove cookies and cache, so it can't be that. You'll have to come up with something Mozilla hasn't yet thought of yet. </p><p>And lastly, Firefox Lockwise (when it was active), prevented me from finding my ""SAVED LOGINS"", gmail account. Not even the search engine could find it (both when Lockwise was active, and after I cancelled the account). This program prevented me from finding my own password, which was needed urgently. And now, I can't get rid of Lockwise, even after cancelling the account. Anf from what I see, I'm forced to sign up with the account again, just to ask this question.

Please, can anyone help me get rid of this bar. I've tried restarting the browser and no luck.

I hated the URL bar that was added in 75 and found it back again in 77 so I tried to turn it off again. After finding that the only solution effectively broke the URL bar (switching browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests to false for reference which stopped it from expanding at all, including to see the websites in the drop down) and no other setting changes did anything, I tried going back to version 76 since the URL bar remained as I had set it in 75.

However, I don't know why those sites aren't working while others that I would think are somewhat similar (IE. DeviantArt, Reddit) are working. While I don't think anything I changed in the about:config had anything to do with this as I only went through the URL stuff, I don't know for sure and is why I included the little backstory above. </p><p>I've tried refreshing the tab as well as closing Firefox completely and reopening it but the issue has persisted. </p><p>I tried uploading an image of what YouTube looks like.

It's especially helpful when I only have one monitor. There are a couple of rough-edges I'd like to see tweaked. </p><p>1. I resize these windows all the time to put them where they'll fit when I'm doing something else, and it can finicky to resize the window quickly. It would be helpful if the areas you can grab the edges and corners of were exaggerated. For example, if when the user's mouse is near an edge or corner of the picture-in-picture window a handle pops-up around the given area that's larger than the 1pixal-ish default handle area. I've seen similar functionality in the art program GIMP for selection boxes. </p><p>2. The way the window acts when being resized isn't very intuitive. The corners work as expected, but since the corner areas are so small I often grab the sides and that can get frustrating. I now know that when grabbing the Bight and Bottom sides of the window the Top-Left corner is anchored while resizing. Similarly, when grabbing the Left and Top sides of the window the Bottom-Right corner is anchored.  That seems pretty intuitive when I type it out, what's the issue? Well, the problem comes when you are grabbing the window near the corners. If for example, I'm trying to grab the window by the Bottom-Left corner and miss (which I've done plenty) and grab the Bottom of the window. Now when I resize the window is anchored in the Top-Left instead of the Top-Right, which is the opposite of what I wanted and leads to some confusion and repositioning. What I would suggest, separate from the #1 solution, would be to break the sides of the window into three areas: Near-corner 1, Center, and Near-corner 2. When grabbing the window on the edge in one of the Near-corner areas, anchor the window at the opposite corner. When grabbing by the center of an edge anchor the window by the opposite center.  </p><p>Thank you for reading my long suggestion. I hope you don't find this to be a negative interaction. I truly enjoy Firefox, and I've very excited about your new Picture-in-picture feature. I hope you understand that this level of nit-picking can only come from a place of love!  </p><p>P.S: I'm very pleased to say that I did not include a third issue I had with the Spacebar Play/Pause functionality not working unless the Play button was the last object clicked on the window, because in the latest update it was gone! I want to thank whomever worked on that and let them know, someone did notice, and they appreciate it! &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-7;feature-request;,firefox,customize,en-US,1321030;,darkkenchi

It outputs in the millivolt range. </p><p>This was driving me crazy, until I diagnosed what was causing it. </p><p>Viewing a web page, I'd immediately get FM interference, making the streaming FM audio, raspy and unlistenable, as soon as I clicked the ""reader view"" icon on the toolbar.  Sometimes, I could click the icon again, to revert to the ""normal"" web page view, and the interference would stop.  And clicking the icon to return to ""reader view"" again, the sound was O.K. </p><p>Other times, I'd have to close the tab entirely (which stopped the interference) allowing the streaming audio on the other tab to continue without interference.  I could then open the tab on the ""offending"" site again, and the audio was O.K.  I'd just continue with this tab in ""normal"" web page view. </p><p>Now, I know there are folks ""out there"", who are just as nerdy as I am, who are curious about how ""reader view"" is causing FM interference.

My mental defects did not prevent me finding thousands of web pages explaining how to complete this task.  However, my mental defects prevented me finding any explanation created since the formation of the internet (I am estimating the internet first formed in 2008, because the dates of the answers I found indicated as such (anything before 2013 is basically the same as 2008 for internet purposes).  And so, I am here to beg a moment of your time to help me resolve this risk to my mental health which will be extremely serious if caching does not discontinue its anti-social activities. </p><p>LEST YOU THINK I AM HELPLESS I found my way to about:config, entered cache into the search and up came about eighty various cache, assundry and other forms of affiliated/associated items.

This kind of character is exemplary and inspiring. </p><p>THE PROBLEM I attempted to calculate how many combinations of values these eighty configs can have.

What I need from them is to behave the way it will be most practical for me, which isn't necessarily aligned with the majority of users. </p><p>My current problem is this. I work with APIs which in my daily work often return various HTTP errors. These errors also contain a payload which describes the problem in detail. I want to be able to see this payload easily in the browser. Yes, I can use other tools like Postman for this (which I do), but for simple GET requests without special request headers it would be much more practical to just use a browser. </p><p>Currently, when my API opens an error (for example a 400 Bad Request), Firefox decides to just silently go back into the previous page (undos the URL change). If I open the Network tab in the Web Developer view, I can however see the failing response with all of its details. Still, this is too impractical for me. </p><p>BTW, the response contains a custom Content-Type which isn't recognized by Firefox by default. But Firefox isn't downloading the payload as a file (like it would usually do for a successful page load of an unknown Content-Type), it just silently doesn't do anything. I've installed an extension to handle my custom Content-Types (called ""Open in Browser""), but since Firefox isn't attempting to open this one, I can't use it in this case. </p><p>So, how can I force Firefox to stay on that URL and show the response payload in the window?

Now I found two bugs: </p><p>Gateway timeout: While developing I got a gateway timeout for an endpoint of my current project. In the console this is correctly logged but in the network monitor I don't see anything. This is quite confusing. The console log looks like this: </p><p>ERROR Error: ""Uncaught (in promise): S: {""headers"":{""normalizedNames"":{},""lazyUpdate"":null,""headers"":{}},""status"":504,""statusText"":""Gateway Timeout"",""url"":""https://myurl.myurl/profil"",""ok"":false,""name"":""HttpErrorResponse"",""message"":""Http failure response for https://myurl.myurl/profile: 504 Gateway Timeout"",""error"":null}"" </p><p><br> Replaying request: Very useful feature, however it seems to have an issue with Authentication headers. When my angular application does a service call it works fine. When I then replay this request I get the response of the backend: 401 you are not logged in. Upon closed inspection I printed out the headers in this response and noted that after replaying the request the header ""Authentication: Bearer ...."" is missing. </p><p>Any hints how to fix these issues? </p><p>Also is this the correct space to report issues/bugs? I also found this url: <a href=""https://github.com/mdn/kuma/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mdn/kuma/issues</a> which i'm not quite sure whether it would be the right space to open tickets for firefox network monitor tool. </p><p>Thanks for your help! </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1318704;,judos

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;1319551;1319559;,ji.perez.marturet
