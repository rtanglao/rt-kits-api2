The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services.

There are multiple bookmarks I have removed hundreds of times...no lie...they keep coming back. for some there are duplicates/triplicates of them in my main bookmark toolbar. I will delete the ones I don't want and after a while, they come back again.  My bookmarks are a mess because of this - I constantly have to keep going back and ordering them by name just so I can make sure I delete all the duplicates. Then, all of a sudden, they start scrolling again replacing the ones I just deleted. This has been going on for months - possibly years...I quit using Firefox for a while because it was so frustrating. I like the product, but this is driving me nuts. additional files attached. 2 images were captured just a few seconds from each other while the bookmarks are moving all around.

For obvious reasons, it can also not modify PDFs opened in Firefox' built-in viewer. However, Firefox seems to always disallow modification if the URL ends in .pdf, regardless of whether that page actually is a PDF file. This becomes a problem on Wikipedia, where File: page URLs always end in their respective file extension, although they are completely regular HTML pages (example). This makes it so that you get effectively flashbanged every time you view that kind of page.
