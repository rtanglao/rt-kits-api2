Where did the Bitdefender Wallet Add-on go? Mozilla updated my browser (it's set to auto update) and it deleted my Bitdefender Wallet add-on for some reason which kind of really sucks. The rub is that Bitdefender Wallet is no longer findable when I search the Mozilla add-ons which is weird, only some useless themes pop up. I need to reinstall it as soon as possible to get up and running again.

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, GNOME 3.28.2 with a 64-bit OS.  </p><p>Recently, I noticed that I could not save PDFs from the internet to my hard drive when I was using Firefox. Normally, if I had opened a PDF in Firefox, I could press 'Ctrl + S' on my keyboard and a save dialog window would appear. Now however, the save dialog window would not appear. No error messages appeared, so I have no screenshots to show. The only thing I could do to save the PDF was to click on the 'Download' icon in Firefox's PDF reader. Right-clicking on links to PDFs and selecting 'Save As' would yield the same result: no save dialog window, nothing. </p><p>I thought that the problem might be because my version of Firefox was not up to date, so I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install firefox' in the terminal. I also updated the flash plugin.  </p><p>Afterwards, I noticed that I could not upload files from my hard drive as an attachment for e-mails. I tried this on different websites and had the same problem. I tried the solutions described on the following pages, but none of them worked.

This resolved the problem. I can now save PDF files by pressing 'Ctrl+S' on my keyboard and i can upload files.  </p><p>I'm reporting this because I think other people might encounter the same problem as I did. Also, if it is possible, I think it would be better to coordinate with the people who maintain the Ubuntu software packages so that only one version of Firefox appears in the 'Ubuntu Software' program, instead of two. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;linux;solved;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1322845;,hancheng.lie

I remember didn't do anything special to set the Firefox on my ASUS; I just use the pre-installed one and the videos and musics are playing just fine. The software I installed are also pretty much the same. </li><li> On my Dell, I tried to play videos and Google Play music using Google Chrome, and they work just fine.

Tis a relief :) </p><p>So the article above says to check this list @ <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements</a> for ""required libraries"".   I am really good at the command line except for checking library dependencies. :/ </p><p>Last link shows these 5: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item    GTK+ 3.4 or higher </li></ul> <pre>   * Bulleted list item    GLib 2.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    Pango 1.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    <a href=""http://X.Org"" rel=""nofollow"">X.Org</a> 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended) </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item        libstdc++ 4.7 or higher </li></ul> <p>My fear is i'll have to search around a while for the exact package name since sometimes capitalization and dashes matter when using apt, aptitude, or synaptic. </p><p>Here's what I am trying so far.   I started with libstdc++ since that's all lower case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $ apt list | grep libstdc++ | grep -v unstable ... ... (super long list of lots of different libstdc++) ... libstdc++6/stable 8.3.0-6 i386 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So since that ends with version 8.3 and that's higher than the ""4.7 or higher"" in the official list above, then I'm good. (By the way, just a plain `apt list libstdc++` returned no results.) </p><p>And substituting the word 'pango' in the above command gives a similarly long list that looks good, i think. Same with 'gtk3', 'glib2', and 'xorg'. </p><p>Oh, i think i've answered my own question :) but maybe went the scenic route with my command since i did not know the exact package names. </p><p>Anybody have a faster way of checking for these?  Pretty please? :) </p><p>P.S. By the way, I'm using Debian but in my experience it wouldn't matter if i was using Arch or even one of the BSD's right now.  Yes, tools are slightly different like apt/dpkg, or ports but am mostly curious for what exact package names to search for to save me time. :) </p><p>Thanks, you all rock.

How do I reach someone who actually works for Firefox?,"<p>Firefox randomly logs out of sites even when I've left the tabs open, and this week there have been problems with re-entering and resetting all the passwords. (Which is a HUGE waste of time and will keep Firefox from being my default browser when I get a laptop with enough working memory left to run anything else.) With Google and Twitter the password issues wasted only about half an hour, but with Yahoo there's still a problem. It looks as if Firefox is trying to re-enter the e-mail address into the password field even when I've typed in the password. Could this be a problem with Firefox rather than Yahoo? Please refer this question to someone who can actually go in and fix the problem, not just a ""nice"" Web surfer with a tip like ""get a new laptop.""

Mozilla Firefox becomes very slow for Google-based services (Google Search, Gmail, YouTube) and unresponsive when HTTP3 is enabled in about:config. Since QUIC is mostly a Google invention and Google services are the ones that utilize it the most, I wonder if Google deliberately slows down Firefox-based QUIC. The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services. There are other non-Google QUIC services and they are actually faster/quicker with Firefox HTTP3 flag enabled. That again makes me wonder if Google deliberately creates an HTTP3/QUIC problem for Firefox... </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321944;1322010;,ponomarc

In this version, but also all the previous versions, I have a problem while scrolling long web pages. Once I have scrolled down quite a bit to far below the immediately visible area, there will be a horizontal area across the entire browser window that does not show anything or is blacked out. It appears as if that area is covering up the info below it (as in a lower layer).  If I continue to scroll further down, these blacked out areas appear regularly. This forces me to switch to another browser (Chrome, Edge) where the problem does not occur, just so that I can read that info or access the buttons etc. hidden in FF.  I am working with a Lenovo Laptop attached to a docking station and two extra 27 inch screens that are turned to vertical and stand side by side.  The attached Screenshot gives you an idea. It was taken from this page: <a href=""https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/</a> with the parameter for number of items to display in the table below the map set to ""Alle"".

I can no longer use Firefox to pay online with StateFarm.  This started suddenly a few months ago. I had no problem navigating to the payment login page with State Farm, then one day I clicked the link and received an error page. I called State Farm Technical service and they suggested I try another browser.  It works fine in Chrome.  I like exclusively using Firefox.  Can this link be made to work on Firefox again? 2.  All of a sudden Firefox stopped opening links in webpage.  It doesn't open a new tab, it doesn't open Adobe Acrobat.  All I get is a flash of the download arrow.  I then need to go through multiple steps to download/open/save whatever it is I'm looking for.  If I don't see the flashing download arrow, it just looks like nothing has happened.  I'm assuming this change came in some update recently.  I have looked in options, but don't see how I can reset the options so links open automatically.   3.  In Options, I noticed a banner iYour browser is being managed by your organization.  I use Avast.  Your article about this suggests turning off Avast for web browsing, but that is advice in direct opposition to my computer guy.  I don't care about the banner if I know why it's there.

1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,2020-06-08 12:02:11 -0800,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"<p>I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"". This comparison exemplified that resource consuming from inside and outside looks very different. The second conclusion is that network usage ten or more times lower than disk usage, which should not be even if content is unpacked and saved. And the main question is why disk usage are close to memory consuming. This speaks in favor of the fact that disk usage is inefficient and surplus: most data can be stored in memory. Let's consider the attached screenshots. The first part of screenshot 'Firefox external metrics@77.0.1' consists of two parts with ProcessHacker window and contains the following external metrics of the parent firefox process: </p> <ul><li> Working set = 2 GB (summed over children processes) </li><li> Virtual size = 3.25 GB </li><li> Network total bytes = 287.1 MB </li><li> Disk total bytes = 3.02 GB </li><li> Disk write bytes = 2.48 GB </li><li> Disk read bytes = 551.23 MB </li></ul> <p>The firefox process structure is in the second part of that screenshot. The same observation -- excessive resource consuming exemplified by the same metrics. To estimate total memory consuming, I closed Firefox and compared memory usage by ""System information"" (ProcessHacker's tool): the commit charge level decreased by 4.2 GB and the physical memory level decreased by 2.7 GB. This means that 1.5 GB memory pages are in the paging file, i.e. stored on the disk! In comparison with Windows 7 memory consuming, we see 748 MB versus 2.7 GB in physical memory. Does Firefox indeed execute so many tasks and provide so many functions and deliver so much value as Windows 7 Pro operating system? The comparison Firefox versus MS Word 2010 with 20 opened documents (about 200 MB RAM consumed) leads to the same observation: the former has much higher resource consuming per functionality/value. </p><p>However, Firefox's ""about:cache"" and ""about:performance"" don't report such resource consuming: see the according screenshots. I summed memory usage by web pages enumerated in ""about:performance"": all 16 loaded web pages consumed 522 MB in total instead of 2.7GB physical memory and 4.2 GB virtual memory. What does Firefox really do?! This is why I suppose that Firefox executes hidden extraneous tasks. To those who would like to analyze Firefox's memory report in detail, I saved and published it: <a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg</a>  </p><p>My point is that disk I/O operations should be decreased significantly in order to prevent Firefox from hanging and to decrease response time on user actions. There are several measures to do it. First, stop using RAM in uncontrolled and ineffective manner as we saw it even on 16 web pages. This means estimating and measuring memory overhead per content byte, per user-level function and per delivered value. Second, stop using disk-based databases, use in-memory databases instead. Third, use effective data structures and data architecture. To prevent memory page unloading, use OS API to disallow unloading of desired memory pages using proper attribute. Yes, if your data/programming languages do not satisfy these critical requirements, use another one. If your data/programming technology do not satisfy these critical requirements, just change it. If your values interfere with this approach, then make the browser’s mission to be the main value -- visualizing hypertext to the user quickly, cheaply, conveniently and effectively. All other values around it have lower priority, remember! No one need safety and transparency and so on if the browser hangs with other process in the system or web page loads more than 0.5 second on a real device. This means you should not suppose the modern or superpower device -- you should suppose any device with one CPU of 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM. These resources are enough to display even 100 pages of 1 MB each in size, obliviously. Just because 1920x1600 = 3072000 bytes (one byte per pixel), i.e. about 3 MB per screen image. The main thing the browser do is it transforms 1 MB of input content into 3 MB image of output. Five or eight GB of RAM is too excessive to this operation, isn't it? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321683;,alexworad

Now this doesn't happen when in normal mode meaning not in picture in picture mode, So basicly i'm saying could you guys look into making picture in picture full screen mode not make the screen go to sleep like in a normal player, I understand I can also turn off picture in picture mode or turn my screen auto turn off after a few minutes off but I would think it would be much better if the picture in picture full screen mode worked the same as watching something in a normal player which doesn't make your screen turn off, Not sure if its a bug or was just over looked either way thought I would let you guys know. Also want to add that picture in picture mode is a great idea, I have always wanted to beable to watch something while working when only having 1 screen and picture in picture works great for that keep up the good work!

We started firefox to reach the profile manager (.\firefox -ProfileManager), the profil manager starts and is crashing after half a second We noticed an installation of firefox 32 bits remaining.

I am also not alone in this matter because as soon as the change was established, communities popped within hours to fix the problem. The old way of fixing this eyesore of an issue was the old about:config and changing around the settings then VIOLA! back to normal.  Now after the update to 77, the Megabar is back and forced down everyone's throat and the old about:config is no longer the fix to this terrible experience. Literally after an hour of this trashbar being up, videos and guides popped up to try to fix it. Whole communities have been formed to hate this feature and ask Firefox to change it, or at least make it optional to go back.  My question is, looking through google has only come up with the chrome.css(?) fix to this mess. Is there any way to change it back to the old url bar without having to go through the chrome.css fix or just uninstalling and reinstalling a previous Firefox or do I have to just migrate to another browser like Opera or Chromium? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321449;1321451;1321460;1321467;1321590;1321789;1321792;1322832;1322866;,quizibo
