However, because the Pic-in-Pic window is spawned as a new window, focused always-on-top, this means even when firefox isn't in focus, other windows will be placed behind it.
This is logical and obviously the most sane development route.
But it would be cool if there were some way to enable a ""fixed to firefox"" option, so that the always-on-top only applied to firefox windows, rather than the entire display environment.

Suddenly they decide to autoplay when switching tabs - note, I've not done anything to my settings or plugins. Fair enough, maybe you changed something (which you often do, without informing). So I check the options. It was on ""Block audio"", which obviously didn't work, so I tried ""Block Audio and Video"" - which WORKS, but now both the video is paused (which I want) AND the audio is set to mute (which I DON'T want) - so... what does it take to have Youtube wait for a click to start playing a video loaded in a background tab, but KEEP AUDIO ACTIVE, so I don't also have to unmute the damn video?

I've configured it to treat the canary domain <a href=""http://use-application-dns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">use-application-dns.net</a> as if it doesn't exist. If I try to open that site in a different browser it says the server can't be found, and if I do a DNS lookup for it it confirms that my system gets NXDOMAIN for that domain name:
</p><p>$ host -t ns <a href=""http://use-application-dns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">use-application-dns.net</a>
</p><p>Host <a href=""http://use-application-dns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">use-application-dns.net</a> not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
</p><p>However Firefox continues to use DNS-over-HTTPs. Is there somewhere to find a log that shows when Firefox looks up that hostname to see if it's actually performing the check?

Every time Windows does an update my startup setting of 'restore previous session' gets cleared so that I start with a single home page.  Additionally, my default search engine gets changed to Bing.  Nothing else seems to get changed and everything works fine once I set the option back.
Interest8ingly the I see the same happen to Internet Explorer (which I keep for use on a small selection of sites)
Does anyone know how to stop these settings from getting reset all the time?

Trouble is, the other two addys were sub accounts, one was a Business Account so much of the info was quite detailed but the same.   But these days, data breaches are so comon (yawn?) it's almost not shocking.  But 8 ?  Yikes.  Here's the thing, I thank you for the alerts, but you scare me to death then leave me hanging.  I have no idea which 5 sites had the same PW  (huh ?). I supposed over 20 years online and at 2500 logins, at some point my brain ran out of creative unique login's. I use a Password Program but it doesn't catch 3 email addresses that may share a common PW.   Any suggestions how to ""Resolve"" those breaches which I can barely remember where I've left my britches ?  Thanks.  
5/2500  = .002 %  P.W.s repeated , not the worst odds in the world.  Spread that %  over a 22 year span,  the equation is so low there is an ""e"" in the final outcome !
