Had to go to Safari,"<p>Went to <a href=""http://www.musicnotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.musicnotes.com</a> to buy some sheet music.  I had a 1 page sample.  I then paid <a href=""http://musicnotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">musicnotes.com</a> and was asked to print the music and I could not print.  I finally called up <a href=""http://musicnotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">musicnotes.com</a> and got help.  I was told that using a Mac, a Firefox browser was a problem.  I was then directed to Safari and was successful in printing.  I use Firefox because my use of Safari is limited.  It is not my #1 browser.  Does Firefox need to be fixed?

1280711,2020-02-25 15:13:48 -0800,2020-02-25T17:24:58Z,how to link a page to open it in firefox,"<p>I designed a page in Wordpress but a part of it looks wrong in Chrome, so I want to make sure that people open/view it in Firefox, where it is properly displayed. Is there a way to force users to open that link in Firefox rather than in their current browser? On my homepage and in the menu, I would like to link that page so that it opens in Firefox. What do I need to add to &lt;a href&gt; tag for it to happen?
I want just that one link to be opened in Firefox, so it is no help to suggest a solution which forces users to open all links in Firefox, like adding a code in &lt;head&gt; tag.
Thank you in advance.
best regards,
natalija

1280705,2020-02-25 13:29:17 -0800,2020-02-25T13:39:55Z,Compromised Site-- Security suggestions?,"<p>I am not sure what happened to land me on this page, but once it loaded, it displayed the attached image, then bounced through maybe several hundred pages under the same domain (all displaying the same image) before my computer's RAM topped out and Firefox terminated. First 3 links I was bounced through are below.
I know it is not legitimate. The grammar is weird and word choice is odd. The Microsoft Support phone number on the page is also incorrect. 
Any concerns I should have? I have run a full scan with Windows defender without any issues showing up. Have not noticed any unusual processes running.

</p><p>I however have found that I'm unable to do so on any browser, all except Microsoft Edge. Even when I run the browsers in privacy mode, I still get the same issue...
</p><p>When it comes to the 'Pre-order' or 'Login' screens, I just see a spinning circle, as though the browser is waiting for something. This includes all browsers, including Firefox, Chrome &amp; IE... All on the same machine that it will work on Microsoft Edge.
</p><p>On another front, everything will work OK, when trying it on my phone.
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas, what is going on?

I have researched this problem, switched off Microsoft Firewall, and added Firefox to my list in Malwarebytes Premium. It seems to run okay for a few day6s and then the problem returns?

I wanted to swap the emails on my accounts, so my newer account would use the email I use more often and my older account would use the other email. I did this and it seemed to work. Firefox Accounts sent the ""Primary email updated"" notification for both accounts even. However, when I try to login to Firefox Sync/Firefox Accounts now with the new primary email for either account I get a message that says ""Primary account email required for sign-in"", even though it is the primary email for that account.

In fact this is not (!) in the website's title! And this is what the title bar is for, isn't it?
And don't say branding, I know which browser I'm using - even without this bloat.
It is superfluous, unnecessary and redundant, so remove it or let us remove it.
Thank You.

</p><p>Basically, I plan to migrate my existing mobile and desktop website to single PWA based responsive website. Right now, I have mobile website which is a PWA, and a desktop website. Goal is to have a single PWA based responsive website for both mobile and desktop platform. However, I want to make sure the proposed website will work with Firefox desktop. From what I could find Firefox doesn't support option to install PWA as an app with it's own shortcut as it is possible in Chrome. But I want to make sure it supports rest of the features of PWA, and website still works correctly in terms of UI and experience as in case when it is accessed from Chrome browser.
</p><p>Appreciate a response on this. In case you require more clarity on the problem statement, do let me know.

An example is if I RC on a hyperlink, the next time I RC on the Google search bar or anywhere else, the same menu comes up. If I RC on an icon sometimes the menu with the back/forward arrows that appear on the top will come up and then if I RC on something like the area to type this text the same menu follows. It used to include cut, copy and paste and now it never does, making it difficult to do these functions for searches, typing text, etc. This is an issue unique to the  Firefox browser and it does it in no others programs. Can anyone provide possible reasons why this is happening and a solution to fix it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
