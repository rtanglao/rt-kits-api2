Suddenly that no longer is the case. I've gone to Control Panel, ""Associate a file type with a specific program,"" but it no longer offers Firefox as an option. I tried adding it as an option with ""Change Program: Other Programs"" which allows me to set up Google Chrome as the default for opening JPGs, but it won't allow me to set Firefox.

1280949,2020-02-28 11:53:10 -0800,2020-02-28T11:53:10Z,"Firefox does not route audio through macOS speakers configuration, it overrides and writes audio straight to master out so audio cannot be routed","<p>Firefox does not obey ""Audio MIDI Setup"" in Apple macOS at all! It overwrites to whatever selected device master out preventing the audio from being properly routed according to the ""Audio MIDI Setup"" standard Apple macOS Audio Setup. If you need to route to a Quadraphonic, or anything other than Stereo you won't be able to do it. If you need to route the audio through a special set of virtual audio channels where you can add compressors, EQ, filters, it will not let you. Google Chrome and Safari do this right without any need to change any settings or configurations on the browser side, all you need to do is configure the System-Wide Audio Settings in ""Audio MIDI Setup"", which is the only way and standard to the audio configuration on any macOS systems.
</p><p>I am a Linux/Unix System Administrator/Engineer, and I also work with Music Production using special professional interfaces from UA United Audio Apollo x8p and Focusrite. Those interfaces are connected to different sets of speakers, and they also have virtual audio channels where you can add a chain of plugins to treat the audio signal passing through them.
</p><p>This behavior should be considered a bug, although it is probably by design, which needs to be changed to adhere to the macOS system configuration standards for audio routing.
</p><p>I tested this with the latest and greatest stable Firefox version, Google Chrome, and Safari. The only browser misbehaving is the Mozilla Firefox.

1280948,2020-02-28 11:47:44 -0800,2020-02-28T20:58:37Z,Youtube audio quality worse on Firefox,"<p>I'm working at a music company and we have noticed that audio quality for videos on Youtube is significantly worse in Firefox than Chrome and even the new Chromium based Edge browsers.  The audio sounds like it is lower bit-rate with a total loss in low frequencies.  You can literally play the same video in one browser, stop it, switch to the other, and immediately notice the difference.
</p><p>Is this a Firefox caused issue, or do the Chromium based browsers support an audio transport that Firefox does not?  I'd hate to think that Google is just purposely using lower bit-rates on browsers other than theirs for no technical reason.
</p><p>How to Reproduce
1) Open Firefox to a youtube music video on VEMO channel (professional official music videos)
2) Open Chrome to the same URL/Video
3) Play the video on one browser at a time, switching back and forth to hear the difference.

Shift+Del no longer works.,"<p>In previous versions all you had to do was highlight a URL in the dropdown from the address bar and Shift+Del would remove it, but that no longer works in 73.0.1, and it's funcionally impossible to find an answer via search engine because every result is pre-73 and suggests Shift+Del.

I changed passwords this evening for a website on my mac desktop, but after several minutes the website saved passwords on my MacBook had not updated yet.  I refreshed the saved logins page on my MacBook several times, but no luck.  I started with a new tab and checked the saved logins again but they still had not updated.  I eventually went back to preferences, to sync, and selected sync now, at which time they updated instantly.
</p><p>How many minutes should it take for Firefox to update passwords automatically on its own across all devices without manually having to select sync now?  The help pages indicate that sync should update changes automatically when Firefox is open, but after 10 minutes that did not occur on its own.  I have high-speed xfinity internet service with excellent wi-fi capabilities, so there was no problem on my end.  Thank you.

My two TV panasonic 9DX650_SERIES use as Browser th ""Firefox OS"".
While a week the url <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a> warned about there would be changes and the Firefox OS would be useless.
Today this happened. Youtube are impossible to use on Firefox OS. 
Now I am using the Youtube App, an exclusive app to see Youtube on Panasonic TV.

</p><p>When using Firefox, my network speeds are brutally slow (~35 Mbps), while Edge is (~300 Mbps, which is my service speed).  I am hardwired through my router, but it is the same wired or wireless.  
</p><p>I have literally tried every single step through Firefox's troubleshooting and have even completed what I thought to be an entire uninstall and deletion of every single Firefox file on my laptop.  Upon uninstall and deleting of EVERYTHING, I reinstalled only to be greeted with ""Hey, it looks like you reinstalled Firefox, want to refresh everything?"".  I did (another) refresh and still, same speeds.
</p><p>Is there a way to 100% remove Firefox and reinstall?  I want my laptop/Firefox to treat each other as never have met, in hopes that I can install and get the speeds I should be getting.
</p><p>Interesting note, Firefox for Android gets ~300 Mbps no problem on my phone.
</p><p>Thanks in advance!

</p><p>Scenario #1:
</p><p>1. Go to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EnZZGGxU-g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EnZZGGxU-g</a>
</p><p>2. Press the play button in video iframe
</p><p>3. See your tab crashing
</p><p>Scenario #2:
</p><p>1. Go to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/</a>
</p><p>2. Wait couple of seconds
</p><p>3. See your tab crashing
</p><p>Scenario #3:
</p><p>1. Go to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/</a>
</p><p>2. Click on any video preview
</p><p>3. See your tab crashing immediately
</p><p>Scenario #2 follows Scenario #1.
Scenario #3 being repeated even after restart.
</p><p><br>
Description:
</p><p>Repeats each time I press play button on this video frame on that specific page. Tab crashes after such actions repeated after restoration of a tab, in a new tab, also in another window.
After some single tab crashes, now any tab with YouTube that's being loaded crashes automatically after a while (DOM loaded as well as video previews, but after some time close to 1-2 sec tab crashes). Issue repeats in safe mode.
</p><p><br>
Environment details:
</p>
<ul><li> Firefox 73.0 mint 1.0
</li><li> Linux Mint 19, Kernel 4.15.0-88, Cinnamon DE
</li><li> GPU: Nvidia GTX 960 (driver version 418.87.00)
</li><li> CPU/GPU/RAM/Swap/HDD are looking normal
</li><li> /tmp directory is full!
</li><li> One day I switched media.rdd-process.enabled option in about:config to false ( don't ask why ;) ). Even if I make it true as default, tabs are still crashing
</li><li> Used that version of firefox for some time - worked perfectly. This issue revealed only today on that specific URL
</li></ul>
<p><br>
My conjectures:
</p><p>Conjecture #1: YouTube has broken something today
</p><p>Conjecture #2: Some time related stuff (date is 28.02.2019 03:00:00 MSK - so by UTC it's 00:00:00 which is strange)
</p><p>Conjecture #3: This video has a present from Mao with some malicious stuff inside ( still hope my PC won't blow up this morning :P )
</p><p>Conjecture #4: Temp directory is full and that causes quite heavy YT tabs to crash (maybe, if firefox uses /tmp, idk)
</p><p><br>
Hope ur debugging gods will be with you. If you need any more info or help on this subject - do not hesitate to contact me.
