</p><p>As I understand it, NPAPI is now no longer an option, and the PPAPI (Google) will be deprecated next year in 2021.
</p><p>The extension I'm tasked with cannot be provided by a browser extension like the ones in the mozilla store as it needs to provide additional API's that will be called from JavaScript code running in loaded pages, not under the control of myself, but all confirming to the same standard API calls.
</p><p>I've been trying a few proof of concepts using CEF (Embedded chromium) and have hit too many road blocks, so now I'm exploring a solution that will use Embedded Gecko and/or extensions to a running version of firefox.

</p><p>Can you provide any pointers as to which technologies I should be exploring in order to accomplish my goal.

I have tried all kinds of tips/suggestions, recopying entire profle (all files), copying just logins.json key3.db files, toggling signon.importedFromSqlite setting to false, uninstalling/reinstalling latest FF, it just seems there is some bug where FF does not recognize the logins properly.  I did NOT use a oligarch password on the old winxp/ESR setup.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance.

If it would actually got unspported, I'd have to re-code all the functionality with a lot of hacks on my own, so I'd like to know it in advance, if possible.
