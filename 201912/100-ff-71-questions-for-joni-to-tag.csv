</p><p>I am running a macOS Catalina v 10.15.1 on a 3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5; 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4.
</p><p>I am NOT having a performance issue.  Instead, the browser is not responding as expected when given tasks.
</p><p>1.  It will not open a link in a new tab.  The tab does not open and it's as if I never clicked on the menu item.  Same with open in new window.
2.  It will not open the default search engine from the URL bar.  Instead, it responds as if I mistyped a URL.
3.  It will not allow me to set a Default Search Engine.  The option to do that in Preferences is a drop-down arrow that does nothing when clicked.
4.  It will not allow me to Remove an add-on.  Usually issues with Firefox are related to add-ons, but when I Remove an add-on, then restart Firefox, the add-on is still there.
5. (silly, minor issue) I'd like the tab bar to be dark, again.  The white tabs are too bright!  I know this is silly, but you asked...
</p><p>I did run Firefox in safe mode and all of the same problems continue to occur.
I did reinstall FF v. 71.0 and all of the same problems continue to occur.
</p><p>Help.  Please.

</p><p>..... and continuing on for a bit after that.
</p><p>basic problem is described in subject line.  I could gripe endlessly about prior disclosure, and how appalling it is to see this problem persist over several versions, but mostly I'm curious how it does not seem to have been asked / answered yet?
</p><p>I will upload screencaps if needed, but I am going to a banking website, entering UID &amp; password, and telling FF to update the password.  Not only does it not update for that UID, instead putting it into the ""no username"" storage for this website, but it is storing asterisks (in the same amount as the actual password) instead of the password.  Yes, I clicked on the little ""eye"" next to the password field under Tools.Options.Privacy .. and yes, I tried trusting and just using the stored password both for the UID (it kept the old password) and also for the ""no username"" and neither works.  I can update the password manually when under Tools.Options.Privacy, but I do not have the time nor inclination to do this for hundreds of logins.
</p><p>This is entirely unacceptable, and needs to be fixed post haste.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu)
</p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible. Keep in mind it is already installed. I want to find the page for it at <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> so that I can reinstall it in the future should I need to do a fresh installation.

Of course Windows in it's infinite wisdom will not let you choose which monitor is number 1. This basically makes the feature useless. :(
So, is there some setting somewhere in the about:config where I can control which monitor is default? I can't find an obvious one, at least.
EDIT: I was wrong. It doesn't always open the video on the 1st monitor. It just always opens the video on the monitor to the left of the one the browser is on. :D

</p><p>So I have a pinned tab that is automatically refreshed via an extension. That extension is URL based. From time to time I may accidentally clicked a link on that tab and the URL changed then the auto-refresh stops.
</p><p>In order to keep the auto-refreshed tab's URL, I would like to always open the links on that tab in a new tab, but keep normal behavior on any other tabs. Is it possible to do that?
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>Jeremy

I would like to give each of them a rating to help other people find better extensions, but there seems no easy way to do so.
On Google Play you can review installed extensions in Play Store easily by click each of them and use the one-tap rating button.
On iOS, if you allow them, App Store will even prompt you a one-tap rater after you've installed some app and used for a while, which is even more convenient.
I wonder if Firefox (could) have the same experience. Without it, it's harder to encourage people (who wish to spare the time) to involve in the rating system.

My Voice account open just fine and fast on Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, and Edge Beta!!!
Maybe you (Mozilla) should switch to the Chrome engine too, you are too buggy 90% of the time!

Since then, when switching between tabs there are times when it takes several seconds to go to the tab I click on, and Firefox is locked up while I wait for the switch. Is this a known issue, and if so when might it be fixed?
