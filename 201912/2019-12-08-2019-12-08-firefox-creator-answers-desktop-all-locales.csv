However there's not means of archiving, syncing or backup for all your fastidious work configuring your various websites to open within specific containers. If your local Firefox profile is lost, so is your hard work with container setup. We need means of backing up our container setup, either via some export / import utility or using Firefox Sync. Either is fine as this extension is a more advanced feature, but totally awesome! Thanks.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu)
</p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible. Keep in mind it is already installed. I want to find the page for it at <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> so that I can reinstall it in the future should I need to do a fresh installation.

So, is there some setting somewhere in the about:config where I can control which monitor is default? I can't find an obvious one, at least.

Not too long ago Firefox had an update where if you click on the URL bar then it would enlarge a bit. When it enlarges, so does the font, meaning that if I try to double click a word, the font resizing could shift the text. It is something minor, but something I am so used to doing. I was wondering if I could go back to the old URL bar that only got a blue highlight on click.

I am sure that this used to be handled automatically by Firefox updates in previous Mint versions.  Now, however, it doesn't seem to matter what I try - whether using the Mint's Software function or going onto Adobe's download page.  I always seem to finish up in the same place with the computer just looking at me and declaring that Flash is already installed.

I would like to give each of them a rating to help other people find better extensions, but there seems no easy way to do so.
On Google Play you can review installed extensions in Play Store easily by click each of them and use the one-tap rating button.
On iOS, if you allow them, App Store will even prompt you a one-tap rater after you've installed some app and used for a while, which is even more convenient.
I wonder if Firefox (could) have the same experience. Without it, it's harder to encourage people (who wish to spare the time) to involve in the rating system.
