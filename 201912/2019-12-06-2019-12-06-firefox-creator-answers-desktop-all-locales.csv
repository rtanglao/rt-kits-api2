Prior to trying to enable it for Firefox, I succesfully enabled two-factor authentication for my Facebook, Google and Microsoft accounts.
After trying it for Firefox, I also did it for my PayPal account, so the Authy app doesn't seem to be the problem here.
I tried typing the six numbers with and without space in between and multiple times in two consecutive days, bot nothing seems to work.  I read the QR code succesfully and added Firefox on Authy, but the code just always seems to be incorrect (I'm not sure how to translate it in english, I am using Firefox in Finnish, see the attached image). I censored all the codes in the image.
</p><p>I would really like to get this to work, as two-step authentication seems to be a good way to make my account a lot more secure.

1274489,2019-12-06 13:54:52 -0800,2019-12-06T14:59:42Z,Can't Log In to SSA Website,"<p>About six months ago, I posted here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504</a> b/c I was unable to log into the AT&amp;T website.  Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment.
</p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again.
</p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem....
</p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.  And just FYI, the rep also agreed that my ad blockers should not have been an issue.  Reluctantly, I went to MS Edge - I was able to log in.   I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible.
</p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password.""
	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway
	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.'
	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.  However, I do not use the 'saved log ins' feature or use a master password - I get the impression that is what would be affected if I followed the provisions outlined, and so may not apply to my issue.  Right?
</p><p>All that said... does anyone have any idea why I cannot log in to the SSA site using FF?

Any help will be appreciated.,"<p>I have done everything that is in the support answers, but to no avail.  When I open FF in my jalopy (10 yr old computer), all my current bookmarks, and history for the past 5 years are still there.  After copying the profile, and the entire Mozilla folder (separate attempts), and over-copying the folder in my new computer, there is no change; the files only go back to when I first installed FF on it.  None of your support answers say anything about whether to copy the jalopy files into the local, or roaming folders, so I copied it into both.  Still no difference.
</p><p>In a related migration/replace problem, I cannot sync my new computer with the old, even though they're both in the same account name.  The jalopy and new computer names are both recognized in the jalopy, but the new computer doesn't pick up the old computer name.   This was the first thing I tried to reconcile the two machines.  I am extremely frustrated, and at my wits end dealing with this problem.  Any reasonable assistance and solutions are appreciated.  Thank you.
</p><p>P.S.  If there is a response, will I receive an email or message on my FF account, or do I have to read through 800 instances to find the answer?

This is done with the Task Manager.
However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks.
Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10.
I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes.
</p><p>This is not a serious problem. It's more questioning what Windows is doing with Firefox. (memory is 6GB)

Auto unload tab -- is not a solution. For example I clicked on links and opened 30 tabs in background. PC starts working very slow, Now I want to stop all them, and to read the loaded information (webpages). How to do it? I think it is the weakest side of Firefox. Needed to abrupt all attempts to make network connection, after the ""offline mode"" is enabled.
I need something to stop javascript's attempts to connect, to calm it down. I want to start read webpages already loaded, and javascript occupies CPU. To kill threads in the Process Manager is not a way to do at all, Auto-unload also, I want to read those webpages.  I have enough of RAM, it is not used more then a half. 
Many years ago, when there was HTML4, I used for a little the Maxton browser. It had a button to stop all pages. All similiar Firefox extensions do not act effectively like that.
the issue not in scarcity of RAM, but in a badly design of browser's architecture, that javascript occupies users' PCs.

</p><p>Yesterday I clicked to accept the latest update (to 71.0 I think) at which point the programme simply crashed without warning.
</p><p>I went through various processes to try and resurrect FF, but without success --- FireFox would not run.
</p><p>I eventually resorted to installing Version 65.0 but, despite the update settings being set as above, Version 71 kept installing and making FF a ""non-starter"" again.
</p><p>I made an alteration to the ""about:config"" which seems to have stopped the automatic updating, albeit the ""FF Icon"" still wants to function as ""Updater"" and I get a message (when started) saying FF is unable to update to the latest version - ""click here to download etc.,"" which of course I don't do and FF continues to perform as expected - albeit 65 and not 71.
</p><p>Is there a problem with Version 71 and (possible) Win 7 64 bit ?

I have a problem with browser or cache when visiting a page of my website for the first time.
Ctrl + F5 does solve the problem, but it still may cause poor UX on the website.
Attached image shows how it looks.

</p><p>Running Firefox 71.0 (64 bit)
</p><p>Well seems Firefox has been messing this up again.
</p><p>Anyone have the new work around solution to get my tabs back on the bottom again. They were fine this morning then shut down and went out to lunch and when I came back they were back on the top again after months of being where I wanted them below my bookmark bar.
</p><p>Thoughts on this?
</p><p>Thanks
Dave

But it won't accepted my Master Password when I enter it.  And it won't let me cancel the box/request for Master Password.  I know my password well as I use it on a daily basis.  Nonetheless, I tried entering it into the popup box 6 times, and it's still not being accepted.  Why has Firefox suddenly stopped accepting my Master Password.  I am in desperate need of accessing several websites today that require logins that have been stored on Firefox.
