I signed out of the web mail site and restarted the computer. When I signed back into the web mail site it STILL AUTOMATICALLY input the OLD password and I had to manually input the new one. I checked the password manager and the NEW password is there with today's date as the last time it was changed.  I checked other sites with saved passwords and they still operate as the always have.

Multiple FireFox running  were the cause last time. I stopped this now I see multi pages every now and again it goes stupid. This is not the fastest browser now it takes 20 to 35 secs to load up and be ready- uses 650mb to 1.2 gig of memory. Slows to react and the curers turns to an I beam. Warning message says FireFox is not responding.  This last few up dates have been a let down and an annoyance. I check no update it does - I check to tell me when there is one let me choose to install - After a few days it up dates any way - Why is all this needed - I just want to play a game - it is not in flash- look info or buy a product - it is just bizarre. Anyway i thought you might want to know- the page that says memory problems are solved is not so true- about memory I tried it also - My memory is maxed out in my pc. also hardware is used or not used still acts up - Netscape was the Frontier and I and all who used it were amazed- this is tarnish. If there is a way you can help I will try anything to keep FireFox - I cant buy a new computer -So there I am  - Here we are.  Game = GoodGames - Bigfarm - Im Bjs. it is a nightmare on FireFox -

</p><p>I have an Acer laptop that I'm about to send in for a warranty repair for several different issues.  I was told by Acer that it will likely be reset/reformatted upon arrival.  Also, I was informed that the laptop may be replaced with a completely different unit at their discretion.  
</p><p>I would like to obviously keep all of my Firefox info, history, bookmarks, etc. and be able to restore them to the computer when it is returned to me, be it the same laptop or a new one.  
</p><p>Can someone please instruct me on the proper way to do this?
</p><p>Is it as simple as copying my Profile folder to another drive, and then reinstalling it after I reinstall Firefox back on the laptop (be it my original one or a new one) when it has been returned to me?
</p><p>Do I need to use the Profile Manager?
</p><p>I bought a used Lenovo to use while my Acer is in for repairs.  Today, I think that I successfully synced the two of them.  (I have a Windows phone and thus no Firefox app for my phone, and could not enter a phone number to ""complete"" the sync as instructed) but it seems to have worked. 
</p><p>Will the bookmarks, history, tabs, etc from my Acer disappear from showing up on the Lenovo when the Acer laptop is reset by the factory?  
</p><p>(Or should I even delete Firefox from that Acer that I am sending in just out of privacy/security concerns?)
</p><p>Thank to any and all who can assist me with doing this correctly.  I apologize for any ignorance on my part, I've just never had to send in a unit for repair before.

Chris

</p><p>I sync'd the old bookmarks of my laptop accidently over the new bookmarks on my PC. So I have lost many very valuable bookmarks on my PC.
Is there any possibility to recover the new bookmarks of my PC or they are all lost by now?
</p><p>Btw, when I sync'd I expected to get the new bookmarks of my PC on the laptop, but it worked exactly in the other direction. Because I have more PC's I have the question - before I sync other PC's - is there any indication which PC will be the source (sender)?
Any help will be very much appreciated.

Is there now something different in Firefox's security for this new version?

I seem to have  many more certificates than I really need and many of them appear to be from countries other than the US.
Would I encounter problems if I just deleted all the current certificates in order to update the required certificates?

</p><p>PROBLEM WITH CHANGING THE ""SEND WEBSITES DO  NOT TRACK SIGNAL.""
</p><p>I realize that most FF settings do not  require a restart of FF to take effect but it seems that when changing the ""Send websites a 'do not track' signal from ""Always"" to ""Only when Firefox is set to block known trackers,"" the effect of doing so is not apparent until FF is shut down and restarted. 
</p><p>The issue is that no prompt is given after making this change. There should be a prompt.
</p><p>Recently I have been unable to load videos on a site I visit regularly. After a lot of messing around with the security settings I finally discovered it was sending this do not  track signal that was causing the issue. However it took a ridiculous amount of time to narrow the issue down to that one setting since FF was not giving me any indication the browser should be restarted after making the change. It was only my suspicion that led me to try changing the setting and restarting that i finally discovered how to fix the issue.
</p><p>There is NO issue with switching the setting back to ""Always."" That takes effect immediately without restarting (videos instantly become unplayable). When switching the setting back to the second setting, the videos don't  become playable again until FF is restarted. 
</p><p>IMO, there should be a prompt when choosing the ""Only when Firefox is set to block known trackers"" setting to restart FF so the setting actually takes effect, 
</p><p>OR, fix the issue so FF doesn't  have to be restarted. 
</p><p>Either fix would be better than leaving users in the dark.

O único botão que ele disponibiliza com essa mensagem é o ""Permitir"", mas essa ação só serve para aquele caso. Não tem uma opção de ""sempre permitir"" ou ""permitir tudo desse site"".

</p><p>It's been horrible using a browser with only one row for tabs. It's very hard to find the tabs I want and to manage my open tabs, even using the menu which shows all of them. I often have no idea of how many tabs I have open, and I often end up with multiple tabs for the same page because I am not aware that it is already open or because it would take too long to find it.
</p><p>With Firefox 56 and Tab Mix Plus, I usually had around 40 to 50 tabs open most of the time, and when I'm researching stuff this number easily gets to the hundreds for a while. With Firefox Quantum I have been unable to manage my tabs properly: I end up with much more tabs than I really need and it's hard to keep then organized.
</p><p>I feel like I am struggling to save a marriage that can't be saved. I don't want to leave Firefox, but it's becoming unbearable. Feel free to suggest another browser as a solution to my problem.

</p><p>I do upgrades in different ways depending on if it is a minor or major version upgrade. Nothing odd. With major upgrades I: download the install file, take a backup of the profile, run the upgrade, and I don't select the ""maintenance service"" (advanced install option). With minor upgrades I simply let it install and restart Fx.
</p><p>This time I went from v. 65.0.2 to 66.0.1, since that minor version change came rather close after Fx 66.
</p><p>As per above, I cleaned the cache, did a backup of the profile and ran the install file. At first start of Fx I was confronted with the Profile manager asking for a profile. I selected the default one, and had to check the box to always use this profile. (There is only one. Something wrong with profile.ini?)
</p><p>(I had created another (test) profile many months and versions ago, but it was deleted via the Profile managersince long time ago.)
</p><p>Why this (starting with Profile manager)? Has never happened after an upgrade.
</p><p>And now, a minor version upgrade, Fx 66.0.2 arrived. I hadn't got any notifications in Fx yet, but saw it mentioned in news.  Decided to upgrade by closing tabs and Fx, cleaning cache, to do some other task, and when I clicked on Fx's icon, to start the browser and do a search for updates, I was confronted with the question if I would like to run the upgrade. It was already there.
</p><p>So what has changed?

I want to suggest new features related to bookmarks that will make Firefox even better:
</p><p>If i were to build a new browser , I would invest large amount of my time on bookmarks features, I think it supposed to be the most important features a browser should have.
</p><p><br>
Use of colors: I want to be able to change the color of each folder I have in the bookmarks toolbar, and maybe each of the websites inside a folder.
</p><p>Temperature: On a click of a button each site in the bookmarks toolbar will get a color between green and red.
green means it's a site the user visits more often while red are sites the user almost never visits.
</p><p>Tags: Every time a user adds new website to bookmarks he can tag that website. the bookmarks toolbar will have a small drop menu with all the user's tags. clicking on a tag will switch the whole sites appearing in the toolbar to sites that belong to that specific tag.
In other words the feature will let the user creates many templates or versions of the bookmarks toolbar and switch between them efficiently.
for example  switching between 'university/school' bookmarks toolbar to 'entertainment' toolbar.
</p><p>Syncing bookmarks in the cloud:
I want to choose which bookmarks will be saved in the cloud for syncing.
If I'm at home or using public computer I don't want the public computer to sync all my bookmarks, but the ones i choose it's OK.
for example I can choose that only the 'university' toolbar mentioned in the previous feature will be the one to sync.

No sé qué más hacer para que Firefox vuelva a dejarme navegar instantáneamente al abrirlo y no tener que esperar cada vez hasta que termina de buscar actualizaciones. ¿Alguna manera de solucionarlo o de evitar que busque actualizaciones?

The backups are compressed, and I usually include the version of Firefox last used by the (principle) profile in the compressed archive filename (e.g., userinfo-firefox-56.0_date). I also make a semi-regular sync backup of the currently used profile. So far, so good.
</p><p>My currently synced backup, which has not been compressed and archived, is about a month old. (I did say semi-regular.) I would like to compress and archive it before syncing, but I am no longer sure of the exact version of Firefox it used. I usually run updates when released, and can suppose Firefox 65.x, but what if I would like to be more exact? After running a search of files containing ""version"" in the main profile, I came across a file named compatibility.ini, which resides in the root directory. The contents are as follows:
</p><p>[Compatibility]
LastVersion=65.0.1_20190211233335/20190211233335
LastOSABI=WINNT_x86_64-msvc
LastPlatformDir=C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox
LastAppDir=C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\browser

</p><p>I've been entering online sweepstakes through the various websites of Publisher's Clearing House (""PCH"") for a number of years, but have had trouble with a number of browsers I've used previously; for full disclosure, I have also informed their Customer Service of this issue and will be examining this issue with them simultaneously. I've used Internet Explorer and Google Chrome to participate in PCH activities over the years, but have experienced various problems; late last year, I transitioned over to Firefox, and despite having problems here as well, I had a breakthrough by using Firefox's Incognito mode, which minimized the frequency of performance problems, if not nearly eliminating them altogether. I soon learned that the reason why the site performance improved on these instances was because of the automatic settings of the Content Blocking in Incognito mode, which blocked a number of disruptive third-party cookies from interfering with a site's essential functions.
</p><p>Unfortunately, about a week ago, I hit a snag; while on a PCH website (while Incognito), a pop-up from the page came up saying that ad-blocking software had been detected, and was trying to get permission to get through the firewall. I dismissed most of the initial wave of pop-up messages, but in a momentary lapse of attention, I accidentally clicked the ""I Agree!"" button to allow PCH's third-party content to get past Firefox's Content Blocker. At first, I didn't think there would be a problem, since all cookies and data get undone once Incognito mode is closed, but unfortunately, the third-party content from PCH websites continue to get past the Content Blocker, especially while in a private window. What's worse, all efforts to undo this mistake have failed, despite taking a number of troubleshooting measures to re-establish a firewall on third-party content from these sites.
</p><p>In the last several days, I have refreshed Firefox several times, uninstalled (and reinstalled) the browser on several occasions, and have even used the Profile Manager to delete all files from the browser's profile. Despite all these actions taken, the browser continues to recognize third-party content from all PCH web pages while in Private Browsing. I've also used the site information to adjust the privacy settings to levels higher than ""Standard"" instead; I've set the Content Blocking level to ""Custom"" in order to block all third-party cookies, and failing that, went ahead and set it to ""Strict"" to try blocking everything. Nonetheless, the third-party content still manages to get through, and subsequently drags both website and browser performance down with it. I will include a couple of screengrabs taken in the last few days of recent attempts at private browsing, with the site information drop-down windows visible to display some of the third-party cookies that are detected while Incognito.
</p><p>With all the aforementioned steps taken so far, I wanted to ask if there is anything else that can be done to undo the permission I accidentally gave to these websites and go back to the third-party contents thereof being prevented from displaying while in private windows. Even in the site information tab, it clearly states that ""no special permissions are given to this website."" I would like to repeat for all's benefit that I am also in the process of discussing this matter directly with PCH Customer Service to see if the problem can be corrected from their end, if not through Mozilla. Again, it took a brief lapse in focus to grant this site permission to breach the private-window firewall, but nothing has worked so far to undo this mistake.
</p><p>I welcome all helpful advice to this end, and I thank everyone in advance.

</p><p>I asked this once before, for Firefox does not follow the system  default color scheme.  See the attachment.  Now running 65.0.1, and according to Mozilla article on CSS Scrollbars, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars</a>, this is supported since version 64.  But this also looks more like something I put in my website to color your Firefox scrollbars, not affect my own Firefox systemwide.
</p><p>My scrollbar style is MY property, and I don't believe web authors have any business changing them to their liking,   No website of mine will change my visitors' scrollbars.
</p><p>The question I have is, how and where can I make changes to reverse the color scheme of my Firefox to match the rest of my system?
</p><p>I searched ""scrollbars"" in about:config and found a bunch of entries applied by a deprecated  extension that is no longer around:  They start with ""extensions.noiascrollbars-extension.""  I assume these could be removed, but they are causing no harm that I am aware of because the scrollbars are just as they were before the extension was used.

I have wasted about six hours going round and round in circles and it is causing me a lot of inconvenience, and when you are at work all day using a computer the last thing you want is to come home and have to spend hours trying to rectify something that was working on Saturday.  Kaspersky don't seem to know what the problem is, but I am tearing my hair out, and I will now have to go to the bank and sort out what should have taken me about five minutes several days ago.  Any help would be so appreciated because I am not the best when it comes to computers but I do try and have a go, but this is driving me up the wall, and because I am at work I only pick up my emails at night, and so the last two nights have been dedicated in trying to resolve this annoying problem that no one seems to be able to rectify.

There are so many apps that I love that are no longer available or not compatible? And often no replacements, this is what made Firefox so awesome was the apps.  Now I have virtually nothing of the apps that I use and there are some where I have all kinds of files with information from them I cannot get to and I REALLY wan! For example 'scrapbook'. for example;  I will have to go into thousands and thousands of files one at a time to get them.  I hate the upgrades that you are doing more and more than I like them.  I find myself either downgrading in frustration or using Chrome.  You either have to stop upgrading so fast, make it so more apps are still compatible, or have a downgraded version before Quantum available. (easiest- offer a pre Quantum version.)  If Firefox is for the people, than make it what the people want.

</p><p>Q1:
Currently the dialog/editor for when you want to save a bookmark spawns under the '...' in the address bar, which is on my screen pretty far to the right side. especially because i prefer to save bookmarks with the menutoolbar&gt;bookmarks menu (file edit view history bookmarks tools help) which is on the right side. (see image)
i tried a little in userChrome with #editBMPanel_folderTree {} (which i found floating on the web) but i cannot get it to work.
If thats impossible, is it then possible to move the '...' to the right side?
</p><p>Q2:
When the dialog/editor pops up and i leave it untouched and not hovering over it, it will automatically bookmark the page after 5-10~ seconds. how can i disable that?
</p><p>Thanks in advance,

The only options available in the Page Setup dialogue box are: Format For, Paper Size, and Orientation. On the other hand, clicking the Print button provides several tabs, including one named 'Page Setup', but this one does not provide margin settings either. Another tab here named 'Options' provides the options to leave the header and footer blank but no options of setting the margins. 
Any help would be welcome. 
Thank you.

</p><p>I have had this issue for 3 days now. I am unable to access yahoo mail or yahoo in general because I get warning potential risk ahead message. I had to make twitter account to be able to get in touch with yahoo support but they just offered a yahoo link which, of course, I am unable to open because of ""potential risk ahead"". I tried solutions suggested by people here at mozilla support, like clearing history, cache etc but it didn't work. I also tired accessing yahoo via internet explorer and chrome (installed on my father's laptop, windows 10) Of course same message appears. I am using windows 7 64 bit. I also tried Edge and of course it says yahoo site is not secure. I have never had these kind of problems before. I was always able to access yahoo via FIrefox and other browsers. It's really damn annoying because i see no solution to this damn crap.  Also I am unable to upload a 170kb screenshot to show you the issue. Just keeps loading and loading and it doesn't stop.  So I guess I will just have to describe it:

Desde la versión 66 algo ha pasado.
Youtube sencillamente se congela, el navegador se congela tanto que de hecho no funciona ni hacer clic en las pestañas. Va pegando saltos, hasta que al final lee el video, se congela a la mitad, bloque total y otra vez vuelve.
Las páginas con imagenes de tiendas como Mediamarkt, sencillamente no cargan.
Utilizo Chrome y zas, todo carga a una velocidad asombrosa.
No es problema de mi conexión, porque he probado Chroma, Opera, incluso Internet Explorer. Todos van mejor que Firefox desde la versión 66.
Va tan mal, que de hecho voy a tener que migrar todos los marcadores a Chrome para dejar de usarlo.
¿Se puede arreglar esto, o es que la han fastidiado con esta nueva actualización?

Especially the ""My Portfolio"" pages as well a stock's ""Conversation"" message boards page (""My Portfolio"" is a personal listing of stocks you can keep track of) .   Takes about 15 seconds for the ""My Portfolio"" page to fully load  and it never took that long before.   Then when you click one of the stocks to get their detailed page, there's a delay for that page to load and for the ""conversation"" (message board) tab to work.  Again, up until two months ago, I never had that trouble.   And once you get into the message board's page, and you want to click the tab to go from ""Top reactions"" to ""Newest reactions"" it takes multiple clicks for it to get there. 
</p><p>I think the problem has to do with more picture and video ads on the right side of the page, they take longer to load, and therefore, it takes these pages longer to load.   But I'm not having these delays using Chrome, nor am I having these issues with Firefox on any other web site.   And it has nothing to do with deleting my cookies and temp files or anything on my end.   So this is a Firefox issue with Yahoo Finance.

I'm using Windows 10 (1809) with Mozilla Firefox 66.0.1 on my PC. Since many Firefox versions I have the issue, that Firefox crashed immediately at the first start. The second start and all other subsequent starts works fine, as long I will not log off and log on again. Then Firefox crashes again on the first start (same behavior as mentioned).
Here a list what I have done/checked so far:
- Firefox Crash Report is not available, no crash information windows appears
- Firefox is installed in the current latest version
- All Windows 10 Updates are installed
- Newest Nvidia Graphics driver is installed
- New Firefox-Profile created (same behaviour as with my current profile mentioned above)
- New Windows User created (same behaviour as with my current user mentioned above)
- Firefox reinstalled, with deletion of the installation directories and profiles
- Firefox hardware acceleration disabled
- I switched off my Kaspersky Internet Security before the first start
</p><p>Nothing helped. When I click on the Firefox Icon, a Window opens for a few milliseconds and closes immediately. (No more Firefox processes running in Task Manager). Then I click again on the Firefox icon, and the browser opens perfect and runs stable.
After the session I log off/shutdown the PC. When I start the PC again the next day and log in, I have the same issue again. 
</p><p>Does someone has an idea how to solve this issue?
</p><p>Any recommendations are very welcome! 
Thanks in advance,
Simon

(Thanks to jscher2000 for the excellent tech writing and support.)  I've renamed all .jsonlz4 in the &lt;Profile_folder&gt;\sessionstore-backups folder. Sessionstore.jsonlz4 was moved from the &lt;Profile_folder&gt;, recovery-backup.jsonlz4 was copied into the &lt;Profile_folder&gt; and renamed Sessionstore.jsonlz4.  Tabs don't restore , the Restore Session button is greyed out, and no tabs are listed in the Show tabs dropdown revealed window.
</p><p>I know recovery-backup.jsonlz4 has the session I want to restore as I've examined it at <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a>.  I can restore the tabs from the html file that page generates - but I had about 250 tabs open and that will be tedious.  Is there any way to force Firefox to restore that session?

</p><p>I just upgraded to windows10. I don't use a paid antivirus or security software so wanted to make sure I am using 
maximum security add-ons available. I would appreciate your advice. 
</p><p>1) What are the quintessential security and anti-virus add-ons recommendations? 
So far, I am using the following. Is it too much? Too less?
AVAST online security
Ghostery
Ublock origin
ad block plus
phishwall 
IBM security Rapport
</p><p>2) I read that I should keep add-ons minimum. Are there any cons in using multiple add-ons for same purpose?  For example, can I use Ublock origin and Ghostery together as an anti-malware? Or would that diminish the efficacy of each extension? 
</p><p>3) Are the security add-ons one should use in Firefox and chrome more or less the same? 
</p><p>Thank you!!

</p><p>except...
</p><p>if the reason for closing Firefox is to do an update via Help | About Firefox. This has been a problem at least going back to Firefox 57. I specifically reproduced this a few minutes ago for 66.0 --&gt; 66.0.1 , Windows.
</p><p>Reproduce as follows:
Visit a few sites
Ensure that about:preferences#privacy | Clear history when Firefox closes is checked
Update using Help | About Firefox, then click the ""Restart Now"" button
After the update is applied and Firefox restarts, look at History | Recently Closed Tabs; you will see those sites from the last session. Similarly, you will see cookies
</p><p>General comment:
I can think of few times it isn't MORE essential to clear out history or cookies (if that's the user's choice) than when applying an update. After all, many updates are required by of security vulnerabilities, many from unknowing/hijacked sites!
</p><p>I suspect that the problem here is the order in which things are getting done for an update, or that the update routine just ignores normal shutdown/restart protocols entirely and does its own thing independent of user settings. If the latter is the case and it ""really needs to be"" that way (I doubt it — that's a common refrain I've been hearing for decades with complex programs and I have not once come across an instance in which it was more than a convenience for the programmers), there should at minimum be a flag or warning that ""When Firefox was restarted, it did not do a normal shutdown. If your settings require certain actions on shutdown (like clearing history or cookies), that may not have occurred.""

Abri a pasta %temp%, selecionei todos os arquivos e apaguei definitivamente também.

Me gustaría saber si Mozilla Firefox guarda en algún sitio los marcadores como hace Internet Explorer para poder recuperarlos.
El problema es que el disco duro no arranca el sistema, he cambiado el disco y he vuelto a instalar el sistema operativo, he recuperado del disco dañado todos los archivos que no me han dado error pero no he podido localizar donde se guardan los marcadores. ¿Hay alguna forma de poder recuperarlos? como os digo no arranca el sistema operativo en el otro disco porque tiene muchos sectores dañados y lo mejor es reemplazarlo por lo que no puedo exportarlos ni hacer copia desde el navegador.
Gracias por la ayuda.

this is not question but an answer :) While I was trying to figure out how I could get rid of the oligarch password prompt that pops up on every page that I once saved the password for (because I often don't want to login on these pages, just take a look), I found many people asking this. The solution was the MasterPasswordPlus addon for Firefox which stopped working with Quantum.
</p><p>So here's how to do it with webextensions. Please note that I did that just for myself and will not publish it because I'm to lazy to add all the error handling, do updates etc. I just provide this as is, and whoever wants to use it locally or maybe make an addon from it: please go ahead and use the code any way you want! I also post it here so that it can be found in Google for other people looking for this.
</p><p>With these two files (get your own icons please) you will have a webextension that shows a little icon in the URL bar. When you click it, the ""Remember logins and passwords for websites"" options in the preferences will toggle on and off. When it's off, you won't be asked for the oligarch password on sites that you stored before. When it's on, you get the popup asking for it. When it was off and you want your password filled in on a page, you have to switch it on and reload the page.
</p><p>Very basic functionality, but maybe someone has fun extending it.
</p><p>cu,
Frank

Is there a way I can fix this without losing everything I've logged so far? I didn't find anything that talks about the functionality of Network Monitor beyond its explanation here (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor/request_list)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor/request_list)</a>.

Step one, what? the menu at the extreme right of the page that looks like an equal sign but with 3 bars? (Options, settings, sync, etc). Then what?  This is a setting related to adobe and apparently its flash player, but what to do about it is extremely unclear.  Background: Attempting to watch streamed content at major media outlet website, nothing abnormal, not gaming, etc. etc.  Anecdotally, this worked before, but I can't prove it.  This works just fine in IExplorer except for all its slowness and buffering----meaning, once asking to view live content, once finding and clicking at website on the users cable or satellite provider, the above error does not occur and the next screen one is directed to is that requesting user and password for your cable or satellite account.  Once entering that data, poof, up pops the live content.  So, bottom line, this isn't adobe (because it 'works' with IE), this isn't the device (because it 'works' via other method), this is a setting somewhere in Mozilla. Please advise.

(Ctrl Up/Down),"<p>Some months ago I tried using Firefox Quantum and, even though I found the search bar to be horrible, I remember it was still possible to change the search engine on it using Ctrl+Up/Down, and it made the search bar more tolerable.
</p><p>Now I decided to give Firefox Quantum another go to see if I could stomach losing so many features that I have on Firefox 56, but it seems that the search bar's Ctrl+Up/Down shortcut is gone, and now the search bar not only is horrible, but useless.
</p><p>Is there any way of re-enabling this shortcut? I'm using Firefox Developer Edition 67.0b3 (64-bit).
</p>
<hr> Some clarification:
<p>- I know I can use Ctrl+K to access the search bar and use the arrows to select a search engine, but when I type a search and press Enter, Firefox still uses the default search engine instead of the one highlighted using the arrows.
</p><p>- I know I can use Ctrl+L to access the address bar and use the arrows to select a search engine, but that is not as nearly as straight-forward as using the search bar, as usually I have to scroll through a lot of suggestions from the address bar to finally get to the search engines. Also, this doens't allow me to see search suggestions from the search engine I choose.
</p><p>- I know I can create keywords such as ""g"" for Google, or ""d"" for DuckDuckGo and use them to search, but I use dozens of search engines and this would not be a reasonable solution.
</p><p>- Right now the search bar is useless even if I use the mouse: when I click on another search engine, instead of just changing the search provider and allowing me to type the search terms, it opens the search provider's website like it was a shortcut—if I wanted shortcuts I would create and put them on the bookmark toolbar!
</p><p>Firefox used to have a simple and truly awesome search bar, which I still use on Firefox 56. When Internet Explorer was still the main browser, the feature that most stood out for me on Firefox, besides the tabbed browsing and the extensions, was the flexibility and efficiency of its search bar. Hell, I remember that some of my friends only changed to Firefox because I showed them the search engines that I had submitted to Mycroft Project! What happened to you Firefox? How did you get to this point?

But first I disconnected from sync and elected to delete all the saved sync information.
I then went through and tidied all my book marks getting rid of any duplicates and ones with broken links.
All good.
Next I closed everything down and restarted. Had all my bookmarks just how I wanted them.
Reconnected to my Firefox account to update all the saved data from my machine to account. Went away to allow time to sync.
Closed Firefox after an hour or so.
Open Firefox and automatically connected to my Firefox account. All the bookmarks are there as I had left them. No problem. Firefox seemed to delete all the browsing history (or maybe it didn't sync it in the first place).
BUT.....no container data. It has reset the containers to the default state.
Pretty sure this is not how sync should work.
but when I open a private browser its container data seems to be intact.
Anyone struck this?
I notice Firefox updated to 66 on 19/3/2019
Love containers, its close to what the internet should be like
I know container data has not yet been made part of sync (everyone wants it!) but is this a bug or something they forgot to tell us in the new release.
EDIT
Bit more information. websites will not open in new container. Firefox gives prompt to always open in xxx container but then simply hangs

1253784,2019-03-21 03:34:05 UTC,2019-08-10T08:07:33Z,make everything dark in firefox,"<p>Hi,
I'm trying to get as much as possible of firefox to use dark theme to save my eyes at night.
</p><p>I use <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/</a>  to customize the sites automatically and it does an excellent job, except that firefox pages can't be customized with it and by that I mean:
</p><p>about:blank
about:newtab
about:config
about:preferences
</p><p>for the blank and newtab pages I found three solutions:
</p><p>1- create a [userContent.css](<a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/UserContent.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/UserContent.css</a>) file with the following
</p><p>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:blank) {*{background-color:#000000;}}
</p><p>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:newtab) {*{background-color:#000000;}}
</p><p>2- go to about:config and change 
</p><p>browser.display.background_color to #000000 
</p><p>browser.display.foreground_color to #ffffff
</p><p>3- Go to ""Preferences"" and search for ""colors"" click on the colors button and set the background and text colors to the same colors as in 2.
</p><p>now I tried all of the solutions above and all of them have side effects, the most prominent and annoying one is flashing white page for a couple of seconds when opening a new tab or white page while the website, other annoyances is that the settings don't apply to about:config and about:preferences even if I add them in userContent.css
</p><p>-To test the flashing white you only need to open a new tab (while applying my settings above) and you will see it.
</p><p>-To the white page before the site is loaded you need to open the link from another page(if you open a new tab and then paste the link you won't get the white page since the about:blank or about:newtab will have the dark background)
</p><p>so to see my problem do the following:
</p><p>1- go to <a href=""https://github.com/biesiad/deelay#deelayme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/biesiad/deelay#deelayme</a>
</p><p>2- right click on <a href=""http://deelay.me"" rel=""nofollow"">deelay.me</a> link and click ""open link in a new tab""
</p><p>the link will be opened in a new tab that has the background in white or grayish color.
</p><p>How can I solve these problems ? any tip would be appreciated.
</p><p>Regards

This is a new problem, I had it a few weeks ago, the solution then worked. Today, I restarted my machine, and the problem is back. I had to uninstall it, delete the folder, install again. I also had to run ipconfig /flushdns to get it back running.
</p><p>So, I rebooted, tried to run CCleaner to clear out some detritus, it said Firefox was open. It wasn't. So I tried to open it and I got a blank screen. I uninstalled it again, repeated the flush, tried to delete the folder but get a message saying I can't because it is open. Though it is not on my machine. I cannot root it out, like some kind of ghost.
</p><p>I've changed my default browser. I'm a little tired of this issue continuing. It is not happening in any other browser. So, I am open to suggestions as to what to to do, and how to avoid this coming up repeatedly as well. Each time I've gone through this reinstall process, I've had to redo everything, pinned tabs, etc. This is far too high maintenance a program to keep. It is depressing.

I have rebooted since the last time this happened, so I have no idea why today it got recalcitrant on me again. I don't want to spend three hours on this problem over and over, I hope you get why. I'd appreciate any advice. I am a half inch away from just moving on completely. That frustrated. I just love so many things about this browser I hate to give it up but I haven't the time to keep this merry go round going either. Thanks.

I eventually regained full security control

It  recommend Bitdefender Free Edition and paid Internet Security 2018 Edition Software.

Federal DES Accounts, etc
</p><p>I  just now did a Chat with Bitdefender Technical Support
and they said there is no remaining compatibility problem
between Firefox and Bitdefender.
100 % Compatible ?
.
So I did a search using DuckDuckGo, Bitdefender, Mozilla internet sites
and found plenty of problems that appear to have been solved
recently ?

Firefox Focus and Thunderbird
to improve PC &amp; Cell Phone Privacy and Security.
</p><p>Bitdefender recommends uninstalling
all Security Software
before attempting to install any Edition of Bitdefender
and the Technical Support Person I Chatted with
confirmed this.
</p><p>The Technical Support Person recommended
Bitdefender Total Security 30 day free trial version
because I was going to install
the Free version to test it out
and then if it had no problems
with Firefox, Google Chrome, and IE
then I was thinking of upgrading
next month April 2019
to the Internet Security 2019 Edition.
</p><p>Right now Bitdefender has a special price
on the Total Security Edition of 44 USD
as apposed to the 40 USD for the Internet Security 2018 Edition

Install Bitdefender Total Security 30 day trial

</p><p>I am in the Netherlands and by default, the Firefox that is downloaded from the main page is in Dutch. I dislike having my applications in Dutch so I tend to set them to English at the earliest opportunity but Firefox seems to be stuck somewhere halfway in between. Here's what I did/tried:
- First downloaded the regular Firefox, set it up, changed the language to English in settings and went on setting up. After a number of tweaks and addon installs I restarted the browser.
- The browser is now in what I would call Dunglish; the settings page and various other things are in English, but the menubar and various other standard controls are not, they are still in Dutch.
- I went into about:config and changed the intl.locale.requested value to only say En-US, before it had NL tacked onto the end of that. No change.
- I downloaded the language pack addon and restarted the browser. No change.
- I downloaded the US version of Firefox and installed it on top of the other, Dutch, version. No change.
</p><p>I'd really rather not remove my profile entirely and start from scratch as I've been working on setting it up just the way I like it for half a day now and I'd rather not redo all that. What can I do?
So to summarize, I know of the language-specific browser version and installed it without results, I know of the article describing how to use Firefox in another language, I know of the language packs and I know of the intl.locale.requested variable already. None of these solutions have solved the problem.
Thanks a lot for reading and for any help you can provide.

I try now and the 'fix' that is offered online is to be sure you have downloaded the current Firefox version, which I just did.  (65.0.2)  Following online directions of clicking on Gmail in top left hand corner, nothing happens!  Clicking on Gmail logo does nothing either!  This should NOT be this different to make changes to people's email addresses/groups.   I closed out of Firefox and reopened browser and that did nothing either.

Yes, I know that a Search Bar can be added or subtracted from the Tool Bar by ""Options/Search/add search bar in toolbar"".  And you can hover over the space between the Address Bar and the Tool Bar, and change the width of one vs the other.
</p><p>That's not what I want, and not how FF has worked for years.
</p><p>The Search Bar can be relocated from the middle of the Toolbar to the next line underneath the Toolbar, whatever it's called, by opening a Customize Tab, and simply dragging the Search Bar.  Initially it ends up at the left of the page, and then can be moved to the right by placing Flexible Spaces in front of it.  I find that I have always liked it placed to the far left.  I leave it to the left side because it's my belief that the cursor will be closer to the left when Search is needed.  In any case there is no restriction to the horizontal position of this Search Bar.  The problem is that FF somehow now in version 65.0.2/64 the Search Bar width is smaller than previously, ~1"" on a 24"" display.  This is unacceptable, how can it be change?

All browser windows are in same order after every restart, so i dont have to search for right one. With any newer version after 60.0.2, windows order is not remembered anymore, with every restart they will be in totally different order. With every new install of newer versions 61-65, i tried to copy back my sessionstore file from 60.0.2 (few times / version), but this does not help - still doing same, all windows will be in diferent order after every restart of Firefox. So, for me it looks like there is someting broken in newer version. In version 61 there is new feature to autorestore session with windows restart, i even tried to disable it in ""toolkit.winRegisterApplicationRestart"" - no help. Thats why i still have to use version 60.0.2. Any ideas? Thanks.

There isn't even a placeholder there for them on the page any longer, just the text that goes with them with nothing where the video should be.
If I try to view one from someone's IG page, it just shows as a black box.
Static images are still displaying fine, just not the videos.
</p><p>This is on my old Windows XP machine, where I have to use FF 52.9.0 ESR as it's the last XP compatible version.
The videos are fine in FF65 on my Windows 10 machine needless to say.
I've tried spoofing different user agent strings, but no difference.
</p><p>The strange thing is that on Google Chrome 49, again the last version which works on XP, the videos still display fine, and that is much older than FF 52 ESR!
Also, if I right click on the IG page in FF 52 ESR, and select the ""View Page Info"" option, the videos still appear in the list on the ""Media"" tab, and if selected, they still display and can be played in the preview pane below, so they're obviously not being actually blocked, and the browser can still play them, they are just not displaying inline in the pages as they should!
</p><p>Anyone any idea what's happening here?
There's no point in me asking Instagram, as I know they will just say that they no longer support Firefox 52 ESR!

It creates tons of entries that are almost the same, and there is no easy way to tell the difference (for example same address different email address). The drop down that appears is overwhelming. I think Firefox could learn some things from the way LastPass has Form Fill Profiles.  The advantage Firefox could have is storing rarely used addresses (which I'm not going to bother with on LastPass), and the Firefox approach functions even when one is not logged in to LastPass.

I have been using Firefox off-and-on since the version 2.0, and there has been one bug that is plaguing me since 10+ years, and that is this error message that occurs when I close down Firefox and try to immediately reopen it (sometimes I wait 2-3 seconds just to avoid this error to no avail).
</p><p>I am using version 65.0.2 (x64) now on latest Windows 10 version (on an MSI laptop with a spec of Intel i7 8750H cpu, Kingston SSD, 16 gb dual channel RAM and Nvidia RTX 2070 graphics card) and have been encountering this bug daily, and it really became so annoying that I'm considering reverting back to Chrome (which NEVER had this bug). This problem usually occurs when my previous Firefox session had more than 4 or so tabs, etc. but it also occurs when I just try to close and reopen the Firefox to test if the bug persists and 1 out of 5 times I get this bug and have to wait around 10 seconds for Firefox to realize there is a leftover session and offer me to close it before being able to open a new tab/window.
</p><p>I have tried removing the .lock file from the profile folder (which DOES NOT remove itself when I end my session and gets recreated each time I restart a session), checking off the read-only mark from the profile folder, creating another profile and disabling hardware accelerating; but none of these made the slightest impact on the frequency I experience this problem. This thread from official Mozilla support also didn't help (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-already-running-not-responding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-already-running-not-responding</a> ).
</p><p>Should I just accept that this is the way Firefox works and that I need to wait 5-6 sec or so before attempting to reopen Firefox (as suggested here <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/131004/how-to-fix-the-firefox-is-already-running-error/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.howtogeek.com/131004/how-to-fix-the-firefox-is-already-running-error/</a> (which dates back to 2012 and saddens me deeply that 7 more years of development changed nothing on this front)), or shut the Firefox down each time by killing it from the Task Manager; or could there maybe a fix to this? I had recently ditched Chrome since it froze my computer (a very rare bug related to the newer Windows 10 versions which occured only once to me, but felt serious enough that I uninstalled it), but if I can't find a reliable fix to this problem, I will probably just go back to Chrome where the bugs won't affect my daily usage.

1253272,2019-03-16 01:50:27 UTC,2019-03-16T03:02:21Z,Why is Firefox so incompatible with so many websites?,"<p>I have submitted many feedback forms letting you guys know that Firefox constantly fails to work with many many websites.  Every single one of them has to do with the way that they implement login's.  Two excellent examples of this are: <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.godaddy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.godaddy.com</a>.  Two very significant sites that Firefox fails to even work with properly.  Another site that Firefox totally fails to load or render correctly would be: <a href=""http://www.vistaprint.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vistaprint.com</a>.  That just loads as a mess and looks like a jumbled mess of items.  The hilarious part is that all of these sites work 100% without issue 100% of the time in any other browser on this planet, such as: Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Maxthon, etc.  So, that begs the question, who is really doing things wrong here?  If these websites are 1) created by huge and reputable companies that obviously know what they are doing, and 2) work perfectly in every other browser 100% of the time, 3) fail in Firefox 100% of the time, who is at fault here? I would say with a fair bit of confidence, around 99.999% confidence, that it is not the companies that built the websites, I would also say with a 99.999% confidence that the list of browsers are all working correctly and rendering the pages correctly.  So, that just leaves one possible choice for where things are failing, Firefox.  I know you guys think you are the best thing since sliced bread and can do no wrong.  I also know that you are dedicated to reinventing the wheel and not implementing any technology or protocols that you have not either copied in house or totally invented in house.  So, what is to be done then?  I have already been moving to using Chrome for nearly all of my activities online, and it have just kind of happened naturally.  I open a page in Firefox, it fails to work, I use Chrome, it works fine.  I don't even know why I have firefox installed anymore.  Then why am I even letting you know?  Well, if no one tells you things are not working how can you actually do anything about it?  It is kind of up to you guys to realize you are obviously doing something wrong and then take actions to fix it.

</p><p>A non-geek Mac and Firefox using friend, said there was no problem, I could just blow those sites off by going to “History” and following the prompts. I did; it didn’t!

It does not depend on the Webpage I am using.  I have restarted Firefox in ""safe mode"" and it still occurs.  It has never happened once when plugged in.  I have never experienced this problem when running any other program or browser.
</p><p>To describe the ""pause"":  My mouse is still alive and moves.  Clicking in Firefox causes the top bar to say Firefox has stopped responding.  I cannot open or switch to any other programs or menus.  Ctrl-Alt-Delete and Ctrl-Alt-Esc does not work.  Whatever I do during that time will finally execute when the computer un-pauses.  I have had the resource monitor open when it happens and nothing unusual shows up.  No high CPU, Disk Usage, or Network Usage.  The only thing that is consistent is that the CPU usage seems locked at about 25% when it occurs.
</p><p>This has been happening for many months, but I don't use my laptop often with it unplugged, so I always have just worked around it rather than taking the time to report the problem.

</p><p>I am experiencing some troubles with Firefox Add-on webpages since, as I can estimate, version 60 onwards.

</p><p>- Also the Firefox Add-on tab (about:addons) looks weird and updating extensions fails.

</p><p>- I can see Firefox Add-on pages correctly in Chrome but not in Vivaldi and Safari.
</p><p><br>
I have unsuccessfully tried the following suggested solutions: 
</p><p>- Refresh the page.
</p><p>- Clear cookies and cache.
</p><p>- Re-start Firefox with add-ons disabled.
</p><p>- Refresh (reset) Firefox.
</p><p>- Create a new profile.
</p><p>- Disable hardware (acceleration) performance.
</p><p>- Disable anti-virus.
</p><p>- Disable firewall.
</p><p><br>
I have also tried to follow the suggestions in the following links without any success:

Note that unchecking the option ""Show search suggestions ahead of browsing history in address bar results"" or even unchecking the ""Provide search suggestions"" in the Search Options of firefox, simply does nothing. The suggestions come out as usual.
The site ""<a href=""http://dptnt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dptnt.com/</a>"" does not exist in my bookmarks and in my history. It is annoying, because for some texts, inapropriate sites such as porn sites come out as suggestions.

User Agent 	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0
OS 	Windows_NT 10.0
</p><p>Just to be obvious.... the solution is not to stop using Nightly.  If it is to stop using Mozilla browsers,  so be it.
</p><p>The new and incredibly horrible @google search is completely annoying and disconcerting.  I start to type in a box in the middle of the page and the insertion point moves and I find myself typing in the url bar, because where I was typing has now disappeared.....  get this guys.  The awesome bar was a failure.  If I wanted to search from that point, I would type my search in there. You know,  that box beside the URL that says search.   I do not.  So unless I can turn this off I will have to just stop searching using Mozilla provided dialogs and go back to the Internet explored 2 way and start going to my home page again,  I want out of this user interface nightmare.  How do I do it?  I have words that describe my feeling but they are not suitable for a public forum.
</p><p>Now I get stopped dead in my tracks so the browser can update itself.  It refuses point plank to do anything but display an inane message that it wants to restart.  I have been restarting it when I was ready,  but apparently user choice is another thing that has met it's demise in the Mozilla laser focus now the prodict refuses to function unless I restart
</p><p>So here I am typing in the search in a place I did not intend because someone as Mozilla though it would be a good idea to turn my cursor into a bouncy ball.  This is not pong.  And I type my query and instead of the results,  nope. Firefox is on strike.  It will be doing nothing until I restart it.
</p><p><img src=""https://prod-cdn.sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2019-03-13-07-33-40-fc0586.png""></p><p>Thought that is poor,  I will take a screen shot...  no  that stuff is also gone because well I don't know really.  but my work flow stops for two or three minutes while Firefox restarts,  not because I said now was good.  Because the product completely failed in all ways to perform it's function as a browser.  Then I get to go to each of the tabs that was supposed to be loading when the restart occurred and select the URL bar and press enter to make the page load because unlike the advertising,  it did not work that way at all.  So how to I turn this abysmal feature off so I can restart when I am ready,  not when the download is done.
</p><p>Come on, I am getting tired.  Instead of doing a couple of last things before bed I am writing a support request to learn how to opt out of this stupidity.  I want to use the machine when it suits me and restart my browser when it suits me,   it might not be until tomorrow.  But if this ""feature"" get to mainstream as is,  I am out of here.  Firefox will be down another user completely disappointed that user choice is gone from yet another project.

It feels like the feedback system for Firefox is not working as well as it should.
If you go to the Firefox menu and click Help &gt; Submit Feedback... you get sent to a ridiculous, infantile page with a happy smiling face and a sad frowning face that is apparently run by an organisation external to Mozilla. This, I feel, reflects really badly on your otherwise admirable organisation. What happened to the old days of a proper in-house, publicly visible user feedback system?
</p><p>If you decide to pass through the ridiculously binary and simplistic smiley face page and submit your feedback anyway, it just disappears into the ether. There seems to be no follow-up, no URL where your feedback can be viewed and tracked, no response and no accountability, as you would with Bugzilla or UserVoice.
</p><p>I think the least that you owe your users who take time out to make suggestions and provide feedback, is to allow their feedback to be trackable and viewable. Ideally some kind of response.
</p><p>Users who want to improve the product, but who don't have a specific *bug report* to file need a better way of doing this. Otherwise they may stop bothering to provide feedback.

</p><p>If I then click the running Firefox or notepad on the taskbar the icon turns back into Ffox, however the notepad icon also turns into Ffox! If I then close notepad the Ffox icon turns blank again. It's bizarre, I've run a few scans for viruses etc but nothing. 
</p><p>In summary: Firefox has a blank icon in the taskbar, it then temporarily takes on the icon of whatever I run next, if I then click on either the Ffox or other running program in the taskbar both icons turn to Firefox icons.

</p><p>I've looked at hundreds of ""new tab replacer"" addons but none of them does what Sitelauncher did. It is such a simple addon yet it is so useful and there is somehow no other addon that does this.
Basically the functionality I'm looking for is to be able to open a new tab and load up a predetermined website based on the hotkey pressed. (Example from Sitelauncher: Press 'Ctrl + Spacebar' to bring up a menu of user-defined websites with corresponding hotkeys. Then you can press ""G"" for example to open up a new tab leading to ""<a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a>"". 
Hopefully my explanation makes sense. I don't want to open up a new tab that hosts links to other websites. I want to be able to open web pages purely using hotkeys on my keyboard.

Clicking Firefox or alt-tabbing very frequently fixes the issue, playback immediately becomes smooth. This is not a recent change, I've observed this behavior for months and finally decided to ask about it.
</p><p>I have no proof that this is a browser issue. It could be a site-specific issue, (I see it most often on twitch but I have also seen it on other video sites like youtube), an OS issue, or something else.
</p><p>That said, I could easily imagine it being an intentional browser feature - if Firefox is not focused, throttle JS execution and other resources to save power. In many cases this could be phrased as a feature for the user. Does such a feature, and is it configurable?

Users are losing control of their computer. When I discovered that websites are now able to read and modify the clipboard I was outraged and immediately disabled these settings! There is absolutely no legitimate reason for such things to be allowed, it's just violating people's privacy and security.

Firefox detects it and after changing the autoenablescope setting, it is automatically enabled within FF.
However it is not actually active and working as it should (no spellcheck or underlining).
By installing through the normal add-ons page it does work, of course. 
But not when installed and activated the silent way.

</p><p>I love FF and have used it for many years.  However, every time I open it, I have to adjust the initial window size and then at least 1 more new window. I am using 65.0.2 64 bit on a Windows 7 machine. I was reading and saw a suggestion to use the command line switches to set the window width and height. So I made a shortcut with the target line as ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -height 850 -width 1800. This doesn't work. So what am I doing wrong or is there an easier way to accomplish this? I am very surprised that there is nothing in the about:config that would allow this type of customization. I also am baffled at what window size is presumed by FF. 
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance!

I am writing this request since I truly want Firefox Quantum be the best ever. 
I found some bugs but I will start with the most important request : the Bookmarks need your help. 
The Bookmarks are set in a JSON format file and Import can lead to an XML format file.
The bug is that you cannot restructure or rename many bookmarks (Favorites) in Explorer mode as I can do with IE.v11.
As example : with the Favorites folder of IEv11, I can Manage or Rename many .URLs simultaneously.
So we need the Firefox Quantum developers to have a JSON to URL converter tool so that we can manage the many Firefox Q bookmarks in Explorer simultaneously. It will be a kind of Bookmarks Folder in Explorer ... That will be great.
Then Firefox Quantum will make then background URL to JSON conversion so that it will update all the Bookmarks in Firefox Quantum ... I hope that you can convey this IMPORTANT Feature directly to the Developer Group concerned by Bookmarks.  2019 0310 1732.

Let me explain ... The Bookmarks are not flexible to Edit when you have hundred of its like I can do in IE v11.
The bookmarks buttons did not get the individual colored it is still flat colored. SO, WE TRULY NEED a JSON to URL converter working in background. This will made us able to handle all bookmarks like we can with Favorites.
This way, we will be able to fully replace Internet Explore v11. The .json conversion to .url is too long to do one by one.
Each times we install Chrome base browser , this is leading an administrator bug in Outlook. I got my new account email and hope to solve it so that I can certify it today. If you can address this vision to the Firefox Quantum developers , it will be great ....  R. Boyer QC Canada  Email : RGJBW_2018@gm.com   2019 0310 16h07.

1252696,2019-03-10 14:59:08 UTC,2019-03-10T14:59:08Z,"Discussion: What functionality would you love added to Pocket the most? (March 10th, 2019)","<p>This is an exact copy of a letter I sent to Pocket today:
</p><p>Dear Pocket,
</p><p>I love Pocket, especially on Firefox, iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire, but I'll wait until I renew my monthly subscription for $4.99 per month. There's so much room for improvement and I have lots of faith in the active development of Pocket, especially on Firefox for Desktop! Just this morning at church, I've thought of many, many ways it can be improved for everybody.
</p><p>(a) Payment methods. -- I'd love to be able to store up to five credit/debit cards, one PayPal account, one Amazon Pay account, and one Google Pay account on my Pocket Premium account so I can easily choose which payment method I want to renew my Pocket Premium subscription with, after Pocket improves its security all around.
</p><p>(b) Editing titles. -- I don't like it that I can't edit titles of pages I've saved in Pocket.
</p><p>(c) Tag character limit. -- I find the limit of 25 characters in tags too restrictive. I think a limit of 50 characters is much better, especially since I use tags like ""active development of firefox"", ""exploring dc, maryland, and virginia"", and ""newer device in 2020 or 2021"".
</p><p>(d) Pocket on game consoles. -- I'd love the Pocket app to be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch so I can read articles from the comfort of my couch.
</p><p>(e) Linking Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, and AOL. -- I don't like it that I can only link my Facebook and Twitter accounts on a mobile app for Pocket and not through Firefox, and I'd love Yahoo! and AOL account integration on my Pocket account, along with sign-in to Pocket for all four of those platforms in addition to signing in with Firefox on my laptop.
</p><p>(f) Stacking subscriptions. -- I'd love to add time on my Pocket Premium subscription well in advance of when it needs to be renewed, up to a limit of five years after today just like I can with my Office 365 Personal subscription, which will auto-renew on 3/9/2024 with my PayPal account. I really love being able to ""set it and forget it"" when it comes to auto-renewals for my subscription-based programs and apps on my Dell Inspiron and iPhone.
</p><p>(g) Firefox integration. -- I'd love better Firefox integration with Pocket. For example, it would be great if I could view my Pocket list with the same great user interface on the Pocket website in my Firefox bookmarks library alongside the bookmarks menu, toolbar, and other bookmarks, with the Pocket list being separate from my Firefox bookmarks in those three other categories. In other words, I don't like having to go to <a href=""http://getpocket.com"" rel=""nofollow"">getpocket.com</a> to see my Pocket list in Firefox. I want more than one way to get to my Pocket list in Firefox.
</p><p>(h) Grouping articles. -- Similarly like Firefox container tabs, I'd love to group my Pocket list with categories like shopping, banking, news, personal, traveling, and plenty more. I love the suggested tags feature, but it certainly doesn't do everything I need it to on a daily basis, especially not on the iOS, Android and Kindle Fire mobile app for Pocket.
</p><p>(i) Profile picture. -- I don't like it that I can't change my Pocket profile picture in Firefox. I disconnected my Google account from Pocket and then immediately added it back. The profile picture matches my Google account on the iOS app, but still shows the old Google account profile picture when I use Pocket in Firefox on my Dell Inspiron on Windows 10.
</p><p>(j) Duplicate pages. -- I don't like it that there's no notification if I'm about to add a page which is exactly the same as one I've already added in terms of the URL. It would certainly be great to have this as an option I can turn on and off in the Settings page in a browser.
</p><p>(k) Sorting pages. -- I don't like it that I can't sort pages I've saved to Pocket by name like I can with Firefox bookmarks. I also don't like it that I can't auto-sort pages by name like a Firefox add-on called ""Sort Bookmarks"" does for me, with folders before loose pages.
</p><p>(l) Page count. -- I like it that I have the option to show how many pages I have in Pocket on my iOS app in the app's badge count icon, but not in Firefox. Why not on all devices?
</p><p>(m) Public lists. -- I'd love to be able to make my list public as an option with a simple link I can copy and paste into an email. There's nothing I need private from others on my Pocket list. It's just a listing of websites like The Washington Post I always love to read.
</p><p>(n) Errors with some webpages. -- Sometimes, Pocket saves the mobile version instead of the desktop version of websites when I click ""Save to Pocket"" in Firefox on my Inspiron.

A 186kb image that is uploaded instantly in Chrome or Firefox developer edition (65.0b11 64 bit) takes about 30-45 seconds in quantum, a 900kb image jumps to 14% when I hit upload, then super slowly climbs up by 2%-4% at a time, finally finishing the upload 3 minutes later, and by the time the upload finishes the google captcha I entered has expired and it tells me to retry the upload. The same 900kb image uploads in 2 seconds on chrome and firefox dev. Also some websites like <a href=""http://twitch.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">twitch.tv</a> are super slow to load, not even a video stream, the homepage takes about 20 seconds to load, then another 30 seconds for the video to start playing, while the site loads and starts playing the homepage video within a few seconds on chrome and firefox dev.
I've tried everything, launching firefox in safe mode, reinstalling firefox and trying with no plugins, switching between system proxy settings and no proxy. Is there anything else I can try? Super annoying having to launch chrome every time I need to upload something.

</p><p>To be clear, Firebox is not blocking the player, nor does Firefox issue a warning message.  It's just a delayed start of the player, as if Firebox is validating something before ""agreeing"" to stream the audio.

</p><p>I am an onsite IT Engineer for a school district. The issue we are facing now is that when my students login to the end user device and  open up firefox they see the recommended pockets. In the recommending pockets is the ""Momo Challenge."" Even though I have worked with my networking team this article/video still shows up when students open up a new tab in firefox. I have worked with my team to try to write up a script to disable the pocket for all of our students via group policy. So far we have had no luck. Is there a way to get this disabled as a mass deployment process than to do one off disabling. I would like to get this deployed out via group policy. Any ideas or recommendations would be much appreciated.

I also have the task bar set to ""auto hide"" which means that the task bar is hidden until the cursor is brought to the bottom of the screen. With the latest Firefox update, this function has been disabled due to the browsing window increasing in size and the only way to restore it to the earlier size is by putting the cursor at the top of the screen. Obviously you cannot have the cursor at the top and bottom of the screen at the same time.
All my computers run Windows 7.

1252319,2019-03-06 16:23:51 UTC,2019-03-08T01:19:32Z,Why does Firefox delete history without warning? (accidential “delete” keypress and full disk),"<p>When running out of space storage (happened to me in 2014 last time, therefore not an issue today), or accidentially pressing the “Delete” key when an item is selected (not just browsing history, also download history, etc.), Firefox IMMEDIAELY deletes the selected history without any confirmation warning.
I usually have always considered Google Chrome as heavily overrated and overhyped, but in this regard (warning before deleting items from history), Chrome is better. (At least, Firefox keeps the history indefinetly instead of deleting after 2 Months like Google Chrome, that however killed the ”ArchivedHistory“ file with Version 37 due to a Google Employee called Peter Kasting. I also miss the “Norwell History Tools” add-on that got wiped off with Quantum's entire WebExtension replacement.)
</p><p>But why does Firefox not warn the user before deleting?
(Are we in 1990? Who designed this? Deletions without warning? Is that the 21th century?)
</p><p>I know, it is not THAT likely to happen, but it just happened to me for the first time: I wanted to press the “end” key right next to the “del” key on my keyboard. Instead, my finger landed on the “del” key and I wiped an entire month of history in one second.
Just like a bicycle crash is unlikely to happen, yet we wear helmets! A car crash is unlikely to happen, yet we wear seat belts!
And please,  “minimalism” and “simplicity” are just toxic arguments to sacrifice usability and functionality for the sake of following a modern, toxic design trend that Apple introduced to the world.

If I then wish to delete the bookmark from the recently bookmarked list it also disappears from the Bookmark Menu.  This means that I have to have a huge 'Recently Bookmarked' list in order to keep those that I return to regularly.  
Any bookmarks which I have previously imported, ie bank, email, FB, do not appear in the 'Recently Bookmarked' list and hence do not produce this problem.
I hope I have explained the problem clearly.

</p><p>There are some fields that FF does not remember. The general FF help says ""If you find that Firefox will save form entries for forms on only some websites, but not on others, the site might be telling Firefox to not save form history. This is especially common on email and banking websites.""
</p><p>However, some of the sites are over-cautions with field remembering, and it would be great to have a field-specific override in FF, allowing saving the save-prohibited fields.

When I have an element focused in a web page, and press the spacebar, Firefox triggers a click on that item.
It is especially annoying if I clicked the play button on any major streaming website, including YouTube or Deezer, and then when I try to pause the video using the spacebar, the following two things happen:
1. Default website functionality triggers a change in media state (from play to pause and vice versa)
2. Firefox behavior triggers a click on that item, inverting the state brought on by 1, and effectively rendering the spacebar useless. The playback goes from paused to play to paused instantly.
I started noticing this behavior with the more recent versions of Firefox.
Is there a way to disable this behavior, so that I can use the spacebar for play/pause functionality like in other browsers?
Thank you

Soubor přejmenuji zpátky na places.sqlite, restartuji prohlížeč a ten zase nějakou dobu dělá dobrotu, po některém z následujících spuštění se to ale opakuje. Soudím teda že v těch záložkách bude asi nějaké nekritické poškození struktury, protože jinak by ty záložky prohlížeč vůbec nenačetl. Tak bych se rád zeptal jestli se ten soubor dá nějak opravit. Např. znovu vytvořit, včetně historie. Komplikace může být že používám některé nestandardní rozšíření, např. u některých složek mám vlastní ikonu pomocí FaviconChanger.

When I click ""Print Preview"" it shows a preview of the page in Portrait, the ""Portrait"" box is checked, scale is ""Shrink to Fit"". When I click on ""Page Setup"", the bubble next to ""Portrait"" is selected in the orientation section. Everything I can see seems to show that the page will print in Portrait, yet when it comes off the printer it's in Landscape. Every single time. This has been going on for at least six months, so it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the version of Firefox as Firefox has updated many times since this began (current version is 65.0.2). 
</p><p>The problem is limited to Firefox. Downloaded PDF's print in Portrait and if I copy/paste a page into Internet Explorer and print from IE, the page will print in Portrait. Which leads me to believe it's not an issue with my printer drivers. 
</p><p>I've tried all of the suggestions I found in the ""Fixing printing problems in Firefox"" article. Checked Firefox printer settings, reset Firefox print settings and reset all Firefox printer settings. After restarting Firefox, and my laptop, I'm still having the same problem. Firefox will only print in Landscape. Other than uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox, or going to another browser every time I need to print something, I don't know what else to do. 
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate the help!

</p><p>I am using Firefox version 65.0.2
</p><p>I tried using your tool to view tabs in firefox profile files, but I dont think its working for me. I dragged a file onto <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html</a>. 
</p><p>I then clicked the SCROUNGE button. I just see a bunch of encoded text in the 'file contents box'. 
</p><p>The file I dragged and dropped was previous.jsonlz4 from  c:\users\matt\appdata\roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\profiles\5120jgru.defaul\sessionstore-backups\previous.jsonlz4
</p><p>Is the tool broken? I read on another thread  that I should see tabs, and be bale to click on them to open them. (I was hoping to copy see the contents of my recovery file, and if correct, then copy previous.jsonlz4 over my recovery.jsonlz4 file, to restore my lost windows. 
</p><p>I also have a upgrade.jsonlz4-20190211233335 file, that looks to be the same size as previous.jsonlz4, as my problem happened after a firefox update. 
</p><p>After the Firefox update, I had to click the RESTORE PREVIOUS SESSON command after I restarted Firefox. What happened after the update is  2 of the 4 firefox windows did not get any restored  tabs, but 2 of the windows did get restored tabs. so I mistakenly closed those two windows without tabs by clicking on the 'X' in the upper right hand corners. I then restarted firefox, and only 2 of the 4 windows opened although those two did have the correct restored tabs.
</p><p>So, I have two questions:
1) is the scrounger tool broken?
2) will copying previous.jsonlz4 to recovery.jsonlz4 restore all tabs in all 4 windows? (ALso should I copy it over recovery.baklz4 also? They have the smae dates and file sizes
</p><p>Interestingly the upgrade.jsonlz4-20190211233335 file previous.jsonlz4 have the same date and size too?

I, as a novice developer, do not understand the logic of the Firefox browser.
The pages of the book on the site http://mybook.stariki.team/ have their own serial number Z-index and are located one above the other with position: absolute.
Test case:
1. Go to the browser Firefox.
2. Hover the mouse over the book.
3. Right-click on the book.
4. Choose from the list - Explore the item
Question:
Why in the debugger I get to the subordinate element in the DOM page with data-number = 3 and Z-index = 496? !!
By what logic did the browser select a page from the middle of the layers located in absolute? Although the top of the book is the page data-number = 0!
When you click the book with the left mouse button, the browser decides to work with the data-number = 3 page and Z-index = 496.

I spent quite some time to figure out how to sign up to this mozilla support forum.  So far the only way I could sign up is to find the ""Ask a question"" text box on a non-obvious page (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/other"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/other</a>) which eventually got to a ""Register or Sign In"" page.  
</p><p>The ""obvious"" place would be a ""Sign Up"" link on the ""Sign In"" page (as is done by virtually any other community forum.  
</p><p>There is a link ""Get Community Support"" in the black top banner of the main ""entrance"" page <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/</a>  but this doesn't let one sign up, which I found very confusing and frustrating.
</p><p>If the purpose of this forum is to build a vibrant community of Q&amp;A seekers and providers, then the obstacles implied in the current site design is a major *fail*.
</p><p>I understand that it is necessary to somehow filter new members for ""fake"" accounts and spam-bots, but there are other and better ways (e.g. smart captchas or 3rd device verifications, etc) than to bury the sign-up page in a deeply nested labyrinth of pages.
</p><p>I humbly ask the site-designers to re-think the 'sign-up' policy and re-design the current process or at least give some instructions on the page targeted by the ""Get Community Support"" link, to not discourage potential support-community members like myself.
</p><p>Kind regards,
-porl3D
</p><p>PS: obviously I managed to sign-up, so I answered the question essentially myself. Still, I'd like to point out the awkwardness of the current design and hope that others in this forum agree and help to escalate this issue to the responsible decision makers.

Figured it might be a password problem so I used the forgot password button.
Filled in my info and it told me that there was no such email or username.
So then I tried to open a new account and it told me that my email address was already in use.
I went around in this circle several times with no change or success.

There is a problem with Firefox ESR 52 (the last supported 3rd party browser version for Windows XP SP3). Does anyone have a workaround - maybe css style tweak or a grease monkey script to fix this glitchy focus problem:
</p><p>My Outlook webmail setup is with all these features are off: Conversation view; Read pane; Focussed Inbox, Sender image; Group messages by date; Attachment preview, Message preview text; and Dark mode. Mainly set this way to not waste page space. On Desktop PC, in my setup, I see 3 columns for outlook email (folder list,mail item list, and advert columns). Moving the mouse focus into the center column causes the mail item list to be erased and rebuilt takes about 2 secs, the same thing happens moving mouse up and down the mail item list. This is backward compatibility bug as rebuilding list is not needed - I am just moving up or down focus on subject text. Is there any workaround to stop this insane madness?
</p><p>Sometimes viewing mail item displays for one second and the content goes away. Close mail item and open it again and it is fine. These two minor bugs just drive you insane :-)
</p><p>(Please do not say upgrade you OS I already know that I just need outlook to play nice with an older Chrome or Firefox - this system is for running legacy apps.) 
</p><p>I think turning on ""Group messages by date"" (yuck) reduces problem a little. Glitching of the vertical mail item list column scroll bar (blinking on/off) when mouse focus enters mail item list column still occurs. This feature is a space waster on page IMHO. Is there a better way to live with this problem?

I got a new laptop in the last month and I've been having a problem with playing Flash games in Firefox. At first I thought it was a graphics card problem because when I tried to play some old Flash games online (which had run fine on the old computer), I got messages about the application being blocked from my graphics card. But I re-installed the drivers and nothing changed. 
</p><p>Even when the games started running, they wouldn't save locally, at all. Online saving was fine, but local always failed. Then I discovered that the same games ran perfectly fine (and saved locally) on Microsoft Edge, so this is clearly a problem with Firefox. 
</p><p>I tried clearing the cache, but nothing. I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. When I was re-installing it, the program said it looked like I'd installed it before and offered me the option to... use default settings or something and remove any add-ons for efficiency, or something like that. 
</p><p>I did not choose that option, as I didn't know what exactly that would do. I have a Firefox account so I can use Pocket, and I have add-ons I don't want to lose.

</p><p>Cause: I have my Firefox set to remember last session. Occasionally, I X out of my main window not realising that there was an ad popup underneath (even though I use adblock). These ads, for whatever reason, have the ability to hide the bookmarks toolbar in their window. That means when you close and reopen, even if you went to a normal site, the bookmarks stay off. It will persist through reinstalls and all kinds of workarounds in my experience.
</p><p>Fix: Refresh Firefox. Click the Three lines, Help, then Troubleshooting Information. Here you can manually refresh firefox, and it will open with your bookmarks showing again (and a few minor cosmetic things go to default, so you may have to re-tick menu bar and customise how you like your main buttons to look etc). I didn't try this with anything other than having one tab open on google the last time it happened to me.
</p><p>Not a question, but hopefully useful for anyone who has experienced this, wasn't sure where else to put it.

Is there a problem on Firefox with eBay? I have tried the same thing using Microsoft Edge, and have no problem amending anything.

All I've tried have some flaw or are missing a useful function.
I've tried several CSS codes to enable multiple tab rows in Fx quantum (now v65).  
</p><p>I'm using this code from Aris' Custom CSS for Firefox: ""tabs_multiple_lines_v2.css"" (multiple rows). 
</p><p>! But, I can't figure out how to <strong>add back the left tab border on UNselected tabs</strong> (because of  the lines of ""UNSET"" code that removes  some Fx 58+ values.  Tried numerous things.  But I CAN add borders for the <strong>SELECTED</strong> tab with the same ""UNSET"" rules in place.
</p><p>Someone added following code to disable some Mozilla changes in Quantum, apparently to <strong>make multiple tab rows WITH a scrollbar work.</strong>  If you comment out any of the lines in this section, a 15 - 18px high ""blank space"" displays between tab rows.
</p><p>But leaving the following ""UNSET"" code in,  also prevents adding a tab border - even a left border on each tab, as separators.
<code>/* remove stuff set by Firefox 58+ */
<strong>.tabbrowser-tab::after,
</strong>
.tabbrowser-tab::before {
</code></p><pre><code>  border-left: unset !important; 
  border-image: unset !important;
  border-image-slice: unset !important;
  border: 0 !important; }<strong> </strong></code><strong>
</strong>
</pre>
<p>I don't know what in the original border image prevented creating multiple tab rows with a scrollbar.
This is the entire code (create multiple rows &amp; adds a scrollbar) from <strong> ""tabs_multiple_lines_v2.css"":</strong>
</p><p>NOTE: the instructions are to place  ""tabs_multiple_lines_v2.css"" inside the /&lt;firefox profile&gt;/chrome/css/tabs_multiple_lines_v2.css.
Then add to userChrome.css, at the TOP of the file an import rule:  <strong>@import ""./css/tabs/tabs_multiple_lines.css"";</strong>
Or you can copy the file contents to userChrome.css  (Aris says some @import calls may not work in Linux or OS X.)
</p><p>Note: I don't know where the ""1.'s"" came from in the code.  I used <code> tags around code.  Those numbers don't exist in what I entered.

Of course there were a few growing pains, being a completely different PC and everything, but Windows got it figured out.
</p><p>HOWEVER; Firefox didn't take it so well.  It's struggling to keep up; I had an earlier version of Quantum on this same PC, but for whatever reason, it isn't responding well to the swap.  Firefox's response?  Blame it on DarkReader.  I obviously disabled it the first time Firefox asked, but to no avail.  Firefox seems to act like it's crippled, which is fine, I guess, but just loading YouTube, it CONSTANTLY pops up with a little yellow reminder blaming it's inadequacy on DarkReader, which is disabled.  Is there any way to to turn this off?
</p><p>BTW, checking Automatic for installation updates is a dick move.  Could be my Windows messing with me, but a lot of my FF preferences were screwed around with since 64.

What is stopping it from resuming itself when it freezes like that?

</p><p>When you are using Firefox for windows  and you click History and than show all history you have the ability to search for key words.  Lets say you type cows and you have clicked on the History tab so it is searching all history .  Lets say 4,000 results pop up in your results field.  Well if you click on the first result  and shift click the last all 4,000 results will be highlighted and if you right click and select delete it takes a very long time and usually the computer freezes and you get script error....   BUT
</p><p>If you right click on the lets say the today tab or even the January tab ( which you might have 2,000 results for cow in plus thousands other hits ) and click delete  it will delete the history for January with no problem.    Why would it take so long and make your computer go nuts when you have 4,000 highlighted manually as compared to the ease of just deleting an entire month in 20 seconds ???

1251787,2019-03-01 15:25:08 UTC,2019-03-01T20:59:21Z,How to install for MAXIMUM stability,"<p>I am a user that wants to get work done.  I want stability.  I had Firefox locked at 50.0.2esd for about two years, and then about two weeks ago, something happened, my computer got updated to 62-something, and everything has been broken ever since.   I think what happened was that my daughter logged on to her account (it was the first time in a couple years she'd been on that computer), and that caused an update, and everything has been uselessly catawampus since then.  I have all but stopped using my ""best"" computer, because my ""old slow"" computer has a predictable Firefox.
</p><p>1.  What esd version would you recommend?  Are some ""esd"" releases more stable than others?  I want a super-esd version that will get security fixes only, NEVER has new features, and has minimum risk of instability.  If there's more than one such super-esd, I'd prefer late-40's early-50s (I would prefer a version that's back far enough to support full Java, I like having toolbars, I really dislike how everything has been removed from visible access on toolbars, and is now buried two or three layers under the three-bar menu.  But those are preferences, not absolute musts.  I realize I may not be able to get back to that.  It's more important to get my bookmarks, passwords and cookies than Java.)
</p><p>2.  My profile was converted.  How do I  get my cookies passwords and bookmarks?  Browse history is nice too, but I can live without that.
</p><p>3.  How do I uninstall EVERYTHING so I will get a clean install?   The best idea I've had is to do the uninstall, and then create a new account on that computer, and move all my data from the existing account to the new account.   That will take hours, but it may be the best of bad options.
</p><p>4.  How do I lock that computer TOTALLY so that I NEVER EVER EVER get another automatic update (except must-do security updates)?
</p><p>Thank you.  Firefox really is an easier-to-use browser than Explorer, Edge, or Chrome, but I really can't afford updates.  They're too unstable.
