I can get to the accounts with no problems using IE. I posted on someone else's same issue yesterday, but I deleted and reinstalled Firefox and didn't save that page so I don't know if anyone ever replied to it. 
I have removed all cookies, including corrupt cookies. I've removed all security software. I don't have any extensions activated. No ad blockers activated. 
On another site it was suggested it's a coding issue with the sites. How do I check/fix that?
The two sites I can't get onto are  citibankonline and billnet

The Copy menu item in the Edit menu becomes greyed out and no selected text is copied. I can correct this by quitting Firefox and restarting; then the Copy menu item is available again and I can copy web page text. All other programs continue to provide copy functions even as Firefox is not able to copy. One other point. When I run Firefox after a computer crash it will bring up a page, then close it, then reopen the page. That is my reminder that I won't be able to copy items without first quitting.

Partial workaround I have found is this CSS, below, which works perfectly for the history sidebar, but not for the bookmarks sidebar. (Note, the same CSS works perfectly in Waterfox Classic, using Classic Theme Restorer, Custom CSS Code, for both history and bookmarks, where the different sidebars can be selected from buttons, instead of only from a dropdown in the FF68.)
</p><p>EDIT: PLEASE NOTE, after posting, the CSS is not formatted correctly. Not seeing any way to format as code, nor do I see any other formatting options for this original post. Several of the number/hash signs (#) are replaced by 1, which is not correct. Other formatting issues as well. PLEASE SEE SCREENSHOT OF CORRECTLY FORMATTED CSS:

In addition:
1. I've tried deleting the Firefox file in program files. Get the same problem.
2. I've tried renaming the Profile folder so when it was loaded, it would create a new one. Didn't work.
3. Followed 90% of an answer to my original query on this board which consisted of:
a. saving the new firefox loader to my computer
b. Deleting the Firefox folder in Program files
c. Deleting the Mozilla ""upkeep"" files. (I can't actually remember the name of this folder)
d. fixing broken links in the registry.
e. reloading Firefox.
</p><p>This last one got some results: the software actually loaded. Unfortunately, it couldn't find any of my libraries, wouldn't allow me to log in (wouldn't even give me a login screen), and eventually crashed giving me the same error as before.
</p><p>When I rebooted (for the 50th time), a new folder had appeared on my desktop entitled ""Old Firerox Data"".

</p><p>When selecting *Ask you every time* option, I can select the appropriate certificate and connect to both application.

</p><p>Since release of the Firefox 70 I noticed that all FTP content opened via direct links is being saved right away, instead of being displayed. As I understand, this was done to close this ""bug"": <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699</a>. Though I guess this change can be beneficial for most users, it's also causing unnecessary problem to me a my colleagues at work.
</p><p>We are technical support team and we are working in the ticketing  system called BMC Remedy. All file attachments sent by our customers are uploaded to our internal FTP server and then linked to the tickets via direct FTP links. Before release of the 70th version it was very convenient for us to click on those files, and get files opened straight inside browser. It worked flawlessly, especially for image and text files and saved us a lot of time. It was also the main reason we used Firefox, since in Chrome always (at least recently) saved files instead of displaying them.
</p><p>But the release of 70th version messed up everything for us, and now all the files need to be saved before they can be opened which causes a lot of inconvenience. So much so, we had to downgrade back to 69th version to work normally.
</p><p>As I said at the beginning, I do understand the reason behind this change since FTP vulnerabilities can harm users on public websites. However, inside closed environments like intranets there is no such threats, and losing ability to quickly preview FTP resources can hurt productivity. So in my opinion, while it's a good idea to have this behavior enabled by default, there should be an option under about:config to enable rendering of the FTP resources back. Or maybe someone at least can make an extension or Greasemonkey script that would bring this functionality back.
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is correct place, but I don't know where else to post this to bring attention to this problem.

I did report this issue back in the day and advice I got turn off extensions. Come on gents, turning off extensions is not an option, especially when there is a good browser like Chromium that loads blazingly fast with all the same extensions.

This LIVE DVD crashes or drops out from time to time so each time this happens I have to re-sync the Firefox it brings up.  This re-sync requires a verification code to be sent by email, but because that email has to go through my Google filtering process,  it usually takes longer than the code's 5 minute validity before I  receive it.   When I do finally get it and enter the received code back in Firefox,  I'm told the code is invalid or expired.   This is because 5 minutes validity is just too short a  time for my setup.  If it were 10 minutes, that would allow me to go into Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt;  Accounts &amp; Import -&gt; Check email from other accounts -&gt; and then order Gmail to perform a special immediate mailcheck on my selected account.   
As a slow elderly old codger myself,  I find it too hard to do all this within 5 minutes.  Why can't we make it 10 mins?

I find my access to Facebook content is completely blocked, whereas all other websites appear to be fine. Screenshot from one of the Facebook groups I follow is attached. I have spent hours trying to figure out your new security settings to enable access to Facebook, including switching off all blocking, and nothing is working, except to abandon Firefox and use Microsoft Edge (which is giving me perfect access). Also very ironically I have to use Microsoft Edge to log into Firefox support as Firefox tells me my cookies aren't enabled...except they are. I have been checking out Permissions to ensure everything is correctly enabled and I notice Load Images keeps reverting to Default rather than Enable – I don’t know if this is significant. At any rate Facebook images and data are not loading and it is clear all the pages are being blocked. I also wonder why my Avast online security is not being recognised by Firefox at the moment. I have been happy to use Firefox as my default browser for at least the last 10 years, but this is ridiculous, and I hope there is a simple solution to these issues or I will be changing to a different browser.

It's sluggish and its cursor focus behavior is enervating. I click a field and start typing, then Gmail, with its (or my computer's, or browser's) slowness takes a second or two to apply focus to its desired field, so it starts inputting my typing in the wrong field or worse, interpreting my inputs as actions (archiving, deleting, starring, muting conversations, opening chats, opening Google Tasks sidebar, deleting open draft, etc., really freaking messy). Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before.
</p><p>How can I prevent sites (or at least Gmail, specifically) from controlling/changing cursor focus? Is there an about:config key or an add-on for this, please?
</p><p>BTW, I don't mind Gmail and/or Firefox being a bit slow, I recognize I contribute to it by have a few add-ons installed and running (though not so many). What I don't want is Gmail choosing for me where my typing input is going.

I have to keep backing out or closing out of Firefox. Initially FF blocked them, but not anymore. Norton never blocked them.
</p><p>These messages only come up when using one FF profile, not another. They also do not show up when using a Chromebook, so I presume the problem is on my end.
</p><p>I have cleared all cookies &amp; cache and did a complete scan with Norton, Malwarebytes, &amp; AdwCleaner. Even restored Windows 7 back to an earlier time. But none of this helped.
</p><p>They are full page messages &amp; say they're from AT&amp;T, Walmart, or Visa. However the addresses all start out with:
<a href=""http://happy.luckyparkclub.com/………"" rel=""nofollow"">happy.luckyparkclub.com/………</a>..
</p><p>Sometimes the messages appears right away &amp; sometimes it takes a few minutes.
</p><p>I cleared FF cookies, went back to the forum, &amp; then looked at the cookies again. I noticed that <a href=""http://happy.luckyparkclub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">happy.luckyparkclub.com</a> and dbmtrk.xyz both appeared in the cookies list at the same time, 23 seconds. The forum cookie was time stamped at 22 seconds.
</p><p>If I look at the forum using a different FF profile there is no problem &amp; neither of these 2 cookies are there.
</p><p>If I open a New Private Window in the problem profile then I don't get the messages either, at least not yet.
</p><p>What does the Private Window NOT access that the regular window does?
</p><p>Which profile folder or file could be causing the problem?
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions.

But I DON'T want to have all my bookmarks, settings, history and especially extensions synced on my work laptop. Since I want to have a different set of bookmarks on my work laptop (related to work) I need to turn off the syncing of the bookmarks (unfortunately I don't  think it's possible to sync two different sets of bookmarks). Same goes for the extensions, settings and history. So long story short, I want to only use the send-tab feature, and to sync opened tabs. 
</p><p>Now here's the problem. When I log into Firefox sync after a fresh install on my work laptop and I enter my credentials, you are not asked what to sync. The default is to sync everything. After that everything is synced right away within a few seconds, and by the time I went to settings to turn the syncing of bookmarks, extensions etc. off, the bookmarks already synced and a ton of extensions start to appear. And probably all my settings that I don't want on my work laptop are synced, too. 
</p><p>Is there a way to choose what to sync BEFORE the syncing starts? That would actually be pretty smart...

</p><p>I'm experiencing multiple issues on Firefox and I'm wondering if these can be fixed, or I'm I'm better off re-installing. To wit:
</p><p>1) Certain sites have stopped loading properly. For instance until earlier today I could load Facebook with no problem, but now only the top blue menu bar will load; the rest of the page is blank white. Oftentimes this has happended with certain other sites; for instance I've not had full functionality on Vimeo or the New York Times' sites for a while. Until recently when I've had this issue with Facebook I've been able to clear the cache and re-load and that has been working, but today I tried this and now that solution doesn't work.
</p><p>2) Certain buttons don't function, such as video playback buttons on The Guardian's site, or certain playback and navigation buttons on Netflix. 
</p><p>3) I tired to log into my Firefox account and got the warning message ""Cookies and local storage are required. Please enable cookies and local storage in your browser to access Firefox Accounts. Doing so will enable functionality such as remembering you between sessions."" Cookies *are* enabled, however, and nothing seems to turn them back on. I've even tried trashing the cookies.sqlite file and re-starting, it doesn't help.
</p><p>I'm tempted to trash the whole install and start from scratch (I've been upgrading from one to the next for over ten years now), but I have thousands of bookmarks I want to preserve, plus many passwords, and now I cannot even log into my Firefox account on the  browser itself due to the erroneous ""cookies"" error massage to confirm that all my passwords are safely backed up. I've tried re-starting in safe mode with all plug-in disabled, and that did nothing to solve my problems.
</p><p>Er... help?!

All it did was open a video conversion website, which worked for the first video I tried (with alot of popups) but the second video I tried, it redirected me to a fake Firefox update page. 
As soon as I tried to cancel it, a login popup kept appearing and all my open tabs immediately went haywire trying to do some kind of redirect, and I it would not let me click on anything. I quickly ended the process to force close the browser, restarted Firefox and cleared my cache and uninstalled the extension. I am concerned about what kind of malware this may have installed on my machine. 
I reported this user over a month ago, but it is still available on the add-on page, and other people also commented about it having malware.

I checked '%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mozilla\updates' and the folder is EMPTY.
I was on v67.0.x and it would have updated to the brand new v70.
Tried installing v68.0.2I had the installer for and it opened in a new window without my favorites, saved logons, etc.
I clicked on the firefox icon pinned to the lower taskbar and it opened v68.0.2 with all my favorites, logons, etc.
Only seems to be one firefox application in Program Files. I Pasted 'about:profiles' into both and attached is the screen grab.
Need to endup running v68.0.2 or v69 but NOT the just released v70. 
Why does an install or update always change my preferences to automatically install updates??

The other one I found was fixed by doing something to the registry, but I'm on Linux, not MS Windows so there's no registry (at least none that I know about).
</p><p>The one other symptom I've noticed is that when I bring up the ""About Firefox"" window, it takes a really long time to figure out that ""Firefox is up to date"".  And it always says it's up to date (if I wait long enough) even when there's a newer version available.

</p><p><br>
I have stumbled upon a weird issue and can't seem to solve it - some of the pages I visit seem to be blurry and lack sharpness in general. You can see it all on screenshots attached. This happens in different places, using gmail just as an example. I am currently typing this in a tab next to that gmail one, text and images here are in perfectly good shape. 
</p><p><br>
What I have already done:
</p><p>- forced my NVidia GPU to work with Firefox since I intially suspected that it might be an integrated Intel GPU that is causing this (I might've done something wrong so if you suspect this might be it - please elaborate on how I could address this);
</p><p>- double-checked font settings, zoom - all seems to be fine;
</p><p>- reset ClearText settings;
</p><p>- checked if this presists on an external monitor - it does.
</p><p><br>
I am not claiming this just started happening after the last update: I haven't used Firefox for some good time and am now considering switching back. Version is included on screenshots just for reference. I am currently on 70.0 (64-bit). 
</p><p><br>

I'd guess 6+ seconds?  The loading icon on the tab will move, but there is no network activity indicated at the bottom of the window nor in the Network Monitor (ctrl+shift+e) until after a few seconds.  Once this delay period has passed, all pages load as normal.  It does this every time, without fail, even in safe mode.  I am using the 64-bit version but also had a 32-bit version still installed, so I decided to launch that version instead, since it still uses my profile and so everything should otherwise be the same.  This version did not have the delay.  I was able to load a webpage immediately.  I have deleted this 32-bit version, thinking it may be interfering somehow (perhaps because using the same profile? idk), but it changed nothing.  I can't imagine how the 64-bit version would perform worse than the 32-bit, so I don't just assume switch over.  I'd like to continue with the 64-bit version, as I have sufficient RAM to make use of it.  I've tried a good handful of solutions, but nothing.  Any ideas?  I've included troubleshooting info, in case that's useful at all.

If this isn't happening to everyone, is there something I can do to reset to even more default appearance in order to make the button visible properly? I know I can open new tabs by menu or hotkey combinations.

</p><p>FF worked fine on 10/22/19. Tried opening FF on 10/23/19 and it kept crashing. I started the task of finding out why. 
</p><p>Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search. It wasn't there the last time I reviewed addons (which I do frequently, trying to find the best addon's for my usage) and I hadn't installed anything new recently. Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.
</p><p>I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. 
</p><p>It is not in the Control Panel. 
It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder.  
Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.
I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. 
It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.
</p><p>How do I get this removed? I don't want it to somehow become enabled in my system.

If I restart firefox in temp mode (extensions disabled) all is good, but when I restart it in normal mode the issue is there again. I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves. 
Any idea what could be causing this? A particular extension? I don't have many installed (I attach a screenshot of my current ones).

Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.
</p><p>Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.
</p><p>In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.
</p><p>Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.
</p><p>Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.
</p><p>Many Thanks.
</p><p>P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means.

</p><p>Well it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. 
</p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. 
</p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. 
</p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!
</p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.

With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. 
</p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again?

This generally works very well.
</p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.  I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.
</p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.
</p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.
</p><p>I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.
</p><p>Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile?

</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.

I changed my primary email address at a time, when Firefox Sync did not support changing email addresses.
I now checked to see if changing email addresses was possible and indeed, you can now add a secondary email address and switch it to be the primary one. So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".
I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.
</p><p>Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?
</p><p>If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?

</p><p>Another page to check if it is installed is (<a href=""https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/about/</a>) which I found from downloading the flash plugin directly from Adobe in a readme.txt file. This page shows the Ask to activate directly on the Flash content, and when I click Allow, it recognizes that I have version 32.0.0.270 installed.
</p><p>Most websites with Flash content that I want to use just don't show the Ask to activate prompt and show that I need to install Flash with the link to download from Adobe. I've tried uninstalling Flash and reinstalling, then rebooting my computer but that didn't help. This seems to be a reoccuring problem for me on linux, not just with Manjaro, but also Ubuntu, and even with other web browsers based on Chromium, like Brave browser. Does anyone know what causes this or how I can get Flash working on some pages?

As per the title, whenever I open up a page in reader view, there is no narrate button. However, in a new profile, there is said button and it works fine. It is only on my current profile.

-Toggling 'Prevent accessibility services from accessing your browser'(about:preferences#privacy), narrate.enabled and extensions.pocket.enabled.
-Restarting Firefox with all extensions disabled (via about:profiles).

<p>As I have tried disabling all extensions to no avail, I've concluded that the issue lies with Firefox's configuration, which might have been changed by some extensions or by me (following guide at <a href=""http://privacytools.io"" rel=""nofollow"">privacytools.io</a>).
</p><p>Request:
Can I know of all settings (including about:config) that can cause the narrate function to be disabled? If not, is there anything I can do other than to switch to a new profile or refreshing Firefox? I don't really want to reconfigure everything. Thanks in advance.

Firefox 69 (también ocurre lo mismo con Chrome) genera un problema en el escritorio de Windows 10, y el problema es que se genera un flickering parpadeo muy molesto. Este parpadeo es un error bien conocido, y ya está documentado en Youtube.
El parpadeo ocurre solamente en el escritorio de Windows 10 y no se presenta en las ventanas de otras aplicaciones, afecta solo al escritorio.
Es un parpadeo que muestra cuadrados con bloques que parpadean constantamente, pero siempre, en el escritorio de Windows 10 y no en las ventanas de otras aplicaciones.
Este parpadeo ocurre cuando se está usando Firefox y se producen ventanas emergentes, al ocurrir esto, se empieza a producir el parpadeo.
No es un defecto de drivers, ya que si así fuera ocurriría en toda la pantalla y con todas las aplicaciones, y no solo en el escritorio de Windows 10.
Deshabilitar la aceleración por Hardware no soluciona el problema.
Este problema se produce cuando se utiliza Firefox y cuando salen ventanas emergentes, pero, cuando Windows 10 está configurado en modo PRESENTACIÓN (es decir, para que el fondo de pantalla de Windows cambie automáticamente a otro nuevo, cada X minutos). Si Windows 10 está configurado en modo Imagen, para que ponga una imagen fija en el escritorio como fondo de pantalla, entonces el flickering no se presenta al usar Firefox.
Desactivar el modo PRESENTACIÓN es lo único que resuelve el problema, pero con la limitación de tenerte que aguantar con el mismo fondo de pantalla sin que Windows lo cambie.
El problema no se presenta porque sea algo de Windows, el problema se presenta si se usa Firefox y Windows está configurado para cambiar el fondo de pantalla con el modo presentación.
Si uso Edge y tengo configurado Windows 10 en modo presentación, entonces los fondos de pantalla cambian y no pasa nada, incluso si salen ventanas emergentes.
¿Cuando podrá solucionarse este problema tan molesto?
Lo raro es que pasa con Firefox y con Chrome, pero no pasa con Edge de Microsoft.
¿Alguien sabe por qué pasa y como solucionarlo permitiendo que Windows me pueda cambiar los fondos de pantalla?
Saludos

I don't get chrome as an option as I don't use it, since Google is crap. Is there any way that I can do it, by importing files myself (and if so, which ones) or something?

The wifi network has issues, it seems to drop some users according to particular devices, like for examples my Asus S300CA laptop. 
The wifi stays apparently connected but data are interrupted.
My question is about what happens at low level communication with gateway and routers when the captive-portal-like banner is shown in the browser.

The page itself is a static page and the HTML is correct when viewed in Inspect Element, which leads me to believe it's a bug with Firefox. However, the issue never occurs when visiting the page for the first time or when reloading the page by clicking a link on the page that links to itself. Resizing the Firefox window horizontally fixes the issue, but just resizing it vertically does nothing. For one of the ways the page breaks, the elements of the table get their height set to the maximum div height for Firefox. Changing the height of the broken element through the Inspect Element tool after the page has loaded fixes the maximum dif height issue. I was unable to check information through Inspect Element for the other ways the page breaks, because opening the inspect element tool on the broken page switches it to being broken the first way with the max height divs.

ui.systemUsesDarkTheme;0 (fixes the CSS bugzilla issue but nothing else)
widget.content.gtk-theme-override;Breeze (or Breeze:light)

Ubuntu 18
Dell Inspirion 13 5000
When any login page opens I can easily move the focus to the id box and enter the id. When I try to change the focus to the pw box, the process slows dramatically, to the point that if press a key a few seconds pass before the little dot appears. Worse, there is no indication that the focus is in the pw box, no blinking cursor, no color change. Worser, on some sites the computer just freezes with the legend in the bottom of the window saying, Waiting for x, x not being the same everytime, but I think it is other websites reading or planting cookies. At this point I reboot the computer.
I have deleted and reinstalled FF - no extensions, no alterations - and the problem persists. I have wiped cookies, I have added/deleted hardware acceleration. Nothing I do seems to alter this behavior.
On this machine I have successfully entered those same sites with Chrome (77.)
Any advice/tips/incantations will be gratefully appreciated.

Tech support at my web host says no problem there, and they can get Firefox to load it.

I also have problems with various specific web page buttons not working in Firefox that work in other browsers (to like a post in a forum, to select a pull-down list of numbers). My web page did come up without problem until this week. ??? I didn't change anything myself, but updates do happen. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

however, most times, when i open a device other than my primary pc 
bookmarks get sync in a very wrong an annoying way:
basically they are multiplied several times and spread all over out of their folders n random order.
many are duplicated, but is not just the full set of them duplicated, 
is more a random thing, some will be tri or quadruplicated, including the folders 
duplicated folders will not have all the same bookmarks inside but a random selection of them.
this happens most times i open my iPhone or laptops and each them will have to restore them from my primary pc.
</p><p>I have once, weeks ago, tired to create a backup file, and then delete all bookmarks from all devices 
i have then waited a couple of days so to make sure they would all sync with no bookmarks,
then i restored the original backup set of bookmarks
it worked OK for few days and then started again as before.
it is very annoying and if anyone has a suggestion would be much appreciated

I have them mostly written somewhere else, and can still login, after some searching, but this is an unwelcome extra step that I thought Firefox would alleviate, by saving logins for websites. This has never been a problem before as all of these site's login information (usernames &amp; passwords) was saved by the browser to easily populate, but now I go to Preferences&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Saved Logins, enter the name of the site in the search, and nothing comes up. It is like the browser has never heard of that site before, nor the login information saved?? 
This is frustrating because there is no way for me to check on the json file that contains the saved logins, that I can find. I have been told that the json file may have been changed to json.corrupt., and I should find it, and rename it back to the original, but this is something I cannot find anywhere.
How can I access the json saved login information file to check it please, and why would the browser just be randomly forgetting saved logins??
Oh yes, and Thanks in advance!!

Is this a joke, or has Firefox just completely lost its mind now??
I swear, I am two steps away from completely giving up on Firefox as a browser nowadays, because they seem to be so stuck on security that you cannot even use them as a browser anymore. Pretty much any and ALL convenience of the browser has been lost to the fact that they block almost everything, for one reason or another, and it is getting retarded now....
Can you do ANYTHING on Firefox anymore?? What is wrong with these people, and why are they destroying a great browser in the name of being overly careful??
Don't get me wrong, I am all for security, but not to the point where nothing works at all. There is a level of security that is helpful, and a level that is beyond necessary, which can completely break your experience. This is where Firefox has moved to now, it is getting to where its wants to be so secure that you cannot even surf the web anymore.
Do I need to go over to Chrome, or are the Mozilla people going to get their act together, and save a really good browser, because I am sick to death of nearly EVERYTHING being blocked by Firefox for one stupid reason, or another!!

I'm running into a problem with Firefox that I've not encountered in many years of use, namely that after about 5 or 6 hours of uptime, any open Firefox tab that I refresh or any new one I create gets stuck showing the ""TLS handshake"" note in the lower left and then times out with a message that the server being contacted is not responding.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem but rebooting the Mac does, in that Firefox reaches any site once again.  But then after another 5-6 hours the problem crops up once more.  All other software continues to run just fine during these TLS handshake problems, such as Outlook, Mail, Sonos, etc.  I did not encounter this problem when running Firefox on this machine with Mojave.  Because I'd rather not have to reboot every several hours I'm wondering if anyone has run into this and/or can suggest a fix for this.  Is there a special setting to change or update in Catalina (the only variable I'm aware of that's changed since my upgrade) or in Firefox to work with Catalina's many new settings?  Thank you.

I wanted to use the bottom most folder because I wanted to hide the top folders and move everything in the Bookmarks Sidebar up and to the left.  Also, Other Bookmarks is the default location that bookmarks are stored, so that is convenient.  Using margin-left:-72px and margin-right:-33px, I moved everything in the Bookmarks Sidebar up and to the left so that it hides the Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Menu, and Other Bookmarks moz-tree-rows (folder icons and text).  I made some other minor adjustments to positions and colors too.

</p><p><b>My Request:</b>
</p><p>So maybe someone can give this a try and see if they can find a solution to my problem or just do things better in general.  But try not to be a jerk about it, and chances are whatever you think works for you might not work for me.  I'm not really worried about perfect code vs sloppy code as long as I am getting the results that I want.  I'm just trying to figure out how to make my Bookmarks Sidebar look how I want (as in Screenshot #2) but still be able to see ALL of my search results (as in Screenshot #4 instead of Screenshot #3) and not have the first three search results hidden.
</p><p><br>
<b>Other Information:</b>
</p><p>I had an idea that never went anywhere.  Basically one element changes from selectedIndex=""0"" to selectedIndex=""1"" whenever search results are displayed.  I was hoping to use that as a condition for changing the margin-top or margin-bottom of another element.  It's been ages since I looked into this, so my memory is almost nonexistent.  But I think that the biggest problem was that you can only do ""if this then that"" if you are dealing with children elements, and I was trying to work with parent elements.

I work in GNU/Linux + Gnome with several tabs (around 100). They have different context (research, personal, related to a course, and work; are some examples). I use several windows with several tabs each. I would like to have one group per window, to be able to close a window and not losing the tabs it had, (to close all the windows and be able to reopen them).
</p><p>I cannot find a way to organize my tabs in such a way that windows don't isolate their tabs. There are plenty of add-ons to group tabs. But all of them end up hiding/unhiding the tabs of only the current window.
</p><p>It looks that the underlying architecture is this:
OS has Firefox.
Firefox has Windows.
Windows have tabs.
Tabs are manageable only in the window they belong to.
</p><p>Therefore, every window is only aware of its own group of tabs.
</p><p>What I am looking for is a different approach, or at least the illusion of it:
OS has Firefox
Firefox has Tabs.
Tabs are manageable, from any instance of a window.
</p><p>Therefore, the window is only a viewer that is aware of all the tabs.
</p><p>The plug-ins: 
Panorama Tab Group, Simple Tab Groups, and similar work a bit, but if I open a new window, and do some browsing, the old window does not know anything in the new window.
</p><p>Is there a setting/plugin that can solve this problem? maybe I am missing some setting or I just don't know how to use the plugins...
Thanks for your time. Best

The aforementioned site has the ""Add sites to your list to autoplay media"", but it doesn't allow to add pages, only to remove them or change the settings.

Firefox is the only browser that ships by default with this behavior turned off. It has to be manually enabled via about:config. Why is this? Why not just by default be consistent with all the other major browsers. In Photoshop, the new quick-save to RGB doesn’t allow embedding. But by Firefox conforming to what the other browsers do, at least we can see images consistently across the web. Please make this happen. What an easy thing to address/fix just be toggling the default setting.

If the Shockwave Flash plugin is enabled and running something in another tab, that crashes too.
</p><p>Most videos seem fine, but when one causes the issue, it causes it consistently. The first ""animated picture"" (it's a video) on this page is an example I've been testing with: <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nya"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nya</a>
</p><p>The issue happens when manually starting that video, or when scrolling down until the bottom of the firefox window reaches the bottom of its preview area (which I assume normally triggers it to play?). This only happens on Firefox. In Opera, it plays as soon as the page is open and scrolling past it causes no issue.
</p><p>Testing once with the Windows 10 Task Manager opened while triggering the issue, some error report briefly flashed at the top of the process list, and it seemed as if the whole Windows UI flashed as well (after that the screen had become brighter and more blue, which I first attributed to some reduced colors mode, but more likely was brightness being reset to a higher setting and perhaps a previously enabled ""Night light"" mode getting turned off at the same time).
</p><p><br>
I first noticed the issue sometime last month in the week following both the Windows 10 mass forced upgrade to 1903 and a Firefox update (making it hard to tell if either caused it, and the grace period to roll back that Windows update is over anyway). Before that the issue never happened.
</p><p>NVidia graphics driver has already been updated.
Already tested with all add-ons disabled, and with plugins disabled (including flash). The most effect that had was getting to scroll past the bottom of that video without it starting, but even that wasn't consistent, and in any case trying to start the video would still trigger the issue.
</p><p>This question is the closest report I have found since, however unlike that user I do not get the issue in other browsers:
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1264003"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1264003</a>
Like that user, the <a href=""http://html5test.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://html5test.com/</a> page shows no on ""MPEG-4 ASP support"" and ""H.265 support"", and the Web Console shows nothing new when the issue happens.

'Address bar autocomplete in Firefox - Search your bookmarks, history, and tabs' ; that is; (a) in Privacy&amp;Security panel delete the checkmarks in all 3 boxes under Address Bar; b) in Search panel click the 'search suggestions' link to get to the Search settings panel; c) delete the checkmark next to 'Provide search suggestions' to disable them.
I also changed the keyword:enable setting to 'false' as instructed in the helpful Forum answer(s) shown in the attached link.
I do not want anything I type in the address bar going to any search engine -  regardless of how insignificant it may be.  The default behavior of involving a search engine in my browsing seems contrary to Firefox privacy ethos.
Also, prior to a few Firefox updates ago (66?) I set the Address bar to not auto-complete and it worked as expected.

at first it looked like they where all gone (which was expected) but! something else is happening (dont know what)
firefox is atm jittery,however opening the about firefox window is no problem, as stated the new tab button is no where to be found.
if I force close firefox it suddenly loads in the favicons of the 23 tabs for a moment and then closes. I tried to restore my session hoping that would work but alas no difference, the same problem remains.
now I always seem to have problems with updates, related to my session, but it never really did this.
Currently I am letting it do its thing maybe it just needs time, currently eating 6 gb, which is normal for a firefox instance, when all my tabs are loaded there are usually 5 of these instances.
the plugin icons are not visible.

I changed the drop down to choose High Performance Nvidia Processor.
</p><p>That's it. After that FF doesnt show the error any more. I dont know why or how it had been set to integrated graphics, and I expect that Mozilla was trying to use the Nvidia processor and was being blocked as a result. I havent seen this as a solution anywhere either so I think it is important to get the word out.

I use a custom web application that (among other functions) allows the print of labels. The labels are configured to the size of the label printers (3 printers, two label sizes). When I print the labels to a pdf file (print dialogue, ""Print to file""), output with correct orientation, size and content is produced. When I print the these labels from a pdf-viewer to the label printers, output is correct. However, when I print directly from Firefox to the label printers, the output is rotated by 90°. Labels from label printing software (glabels) are also printed correctly. On Windows, this is not an issue and printing works directly from Firefox.
Apparently, the problem is caused by Firefox, but restricted to Linux (several computers).

So I figure there could be a file in firefox to do just that.

1270322,2019-10-09 15:05:57 UTC,2019-11-04T16:51:13Z,Disabling Autoplay:  Why is this such a dismal failure?,"<p>First of all, there are so many articles on this site and others that don't update reflecting the huge changes recently in Autoplay options.  So many settings from the past don't work or aren't even there anymore.  Why are these pages not updated?  Who even uses old version of this browser?  99% of the info online is irrelevant because of this sloppiness.  Just go to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a> and see if anything works.  Good luck with that.  
I did find one extension that did work (so far):  Disable HTML5 Autoplay
But we shouldn't need an extension to do something so basic, so intrinsic to web browsing.  We all know distractions impeded our ability to get things done and cost billions every day as people's productivity sharply drops.  There is nothing more distracting than a video!  So its the number one thing to control.  As long as you're over about 4 years old of course.  Under that and we're fascinated by unfamiliar shiny objects.  
</p><p>So I'm curious about all the autoplay options I have in about:config and if any of these settings matter anymore, now that I have an extension that does what Firefox seems incapable of doing.  When I search for autoplay, this is what I get, sorted alphabetically.  I noticed that some are in bold.  Why is that?  And why is Mozilla so out of touch with us that they can't explain what each of these things actually does?  I wonder if they even know.  You should be able to hover your mouse cursor over an item and a popup should tell you what it does.  Is that so difficult?  Guess so.

This basically makes the browser useless and I cannot click on any open tabs or even close it. I just got a new Lenovo laptop (windows 10) and this problem has occurred twice now in the past 2 days.

1270254,2019-10-08 12:48:49 UTC,2019-10-08T12:48:49Z,TLS Handshake timeout since 67.0,"<p>Hello community!
I need your help. We have multiple clients connecting thru a corporate VPN and they are having issues with Firefox: When they try to access a website they are experiencing a timeout with “Performing a TLS Handshake to…”.  This only happens on the initial launch of Firefox. A refresh (F5) or reload immediately opens the website after the timeout. As long as the browser stays open, they do not have anymore issues accessing websites. If the browser is closed and re-opened, the issue reappears for the first website requested. This happens for every user connected via VPN. 
No issues whatsoever when they are directly connected to the network (office).
After some troubleshooting, I noticed that the issue appeared from version 67.0. All previous versions do not have the TLS Handshake issue. We are currently using Version 69.0.1. Redoing profiles did not resolve the issue. VPN Users that are having the issue are on Windows 10 while Windows 7 users do not the problem. Also of note, if the client opens Firefox and leaves it idling for 40 sec. (or more) before requesting a https website, they do not get a TLS Handshake timeout.
No issues in IE11, Edge or Chrome while connected thru VPN.
</p><p>Ideas?

I make a bookmark and it doesn't show up on the other machine, not on addition, not after a day, not until I manually hit Sync now on BOTH machines. I don't think it's working as designed...
</p><p>So my question is, how does sync actually work, if it's neither a scheduled nor a push sync?

after <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/</a> got an update and it uses the Highwind Player for the videos, the arrow keys don't work.
By pressing left or right arrow key, the video doesn't move 5 seconds back or forward, however, pressing ""J"" and ""L"" does move the video back and forward (""K"" pauses/plays the video), pressing up or down doesn't change the volume. Starting Firefox in private browsing or using Edge however, the arrow keys work normally, rewinding or forwarding the video and increasing/decreasing sound. The contrary is also true, J,K,L only work with normal Frefox, but don't do anything on private browser or other borwsers. My question is, since the private browsing is still using the standard player, is there any way I can force the standard Firefox to use the normal player instead of the Highwind Player? 
Thank you.

I need this older FF, because I can use Java on it and I need Java to use one website.
The problem is - since 69.02 I have problem, that after I use oder FF, my new FF deactivates all addons. There are addon in options, but there is no way to use them. So I need to install them again. They work flawless, but when I close FF 69, run FF 51, close 51 and run 69 again, then addons (like ghostery or adblock) are disabled, and can't be enabled.

due to mediocre internet connection, I always liked the option to buffer all the video (pausing it until it ends) to avoid interruption during the view.
Initially, Firefox was set to allow this.
Around june 2017, one update changed that option, but I was able to set some parameters to still allow the full buffering, following the explanations on that thread:
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/tr/questions/1168957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/tr/questions/1168957</a>
</p><p>Now, it's not working again, and I presume something has changed in a recent update.
Is that one a known issue?
Someone has the same problem?
Is there another way to allowing the buffering by changing some of the parameters?
</p><p>Thanks in advance.

1270099,2019-10-05 10:53:52 UTC,2019-10-06T15:59:49Z,Prevent Firefox from Clearing the Cache Automatically,"<p>Hi all,
</p><p>I'm a photographer and I've been using Firefox as my default/go-to browser for dealing with images-related things like uploading and downloading to server, accessing and opening photography-related sites and accounts such as Flickr Pro. I'd like to know if any of you can help me with my problem with cache.
</p><p>So I've noticed that when using Firefox, oftentimes the cache is being cleared/purged automatically, for reasons I don't know yet. I'd like to know how I can keep the cache, or in other words, prevent Firefox from clearing the cache for any reason whatsoever. I really need the cache and I don't mind keeping a large or even massive cache. I'm browsing the same sites over and over again and I'd like to keep the cache instead of having to download it again everytime I browse the sites with Firefox.
</p><p>The problem is I've tried things like disabling smart cache size and increasing my disk cache to 4 GB to no avail. Firefox always clears the cache automatically after certain period of time or under certain or specific condition(s). The thing is I don't know how to stop Firefox from tampering with my cache. None of my add-ons is actually tampering with the cache, nevermind clearing it.
</p><p><br>
Several settings that I've changed/modified manually:
</p><p>・ browser.cache.auto_delete_cache_version: set to -1.
</p><p>・ browser.cache.check_doc_frequency: set to 2.
</p><p>・ browser.cache.disk.capacity: set to 4096000. 
I read somewhere that a Firefox users and a fellow photographer managed to increase the size to 16 GB with his Firefox 69 and is able to keep his cache until he clears it manually, but I failed to repro his steps since my Firefox always reverted back to 380 MB or something whenever I did that. He's probably using custom userChrome and/or userContent css.
</p><p>All these settings are set to false:
・ browser.cache.disk.smart_size.enabled 
・ browser.cache.disk.smart_size.first_run 
・ browser.cache.disk.smart_size.use_old_max
</p><p>・ browser.cache.memory.capacity: set to 2048000.
</p><p>・ media.cache_size: sometimes I set this to 4096000 to see if it helps with anything, but most of the time it is set to its default value (unchanged).
</p><p>・ browser.tabs.remote.warmup.enabled: set to false.
I might accidentally added this to my 56.0.2 (and set it to false) since I don't remember tab warming being in pre-Quantum, but my 69.0.2 has this and I set it to false. There is also a thing with mouse cursor hovering over a tab making it reload the tab, but only after Firefox clear my cache.
</p><p><br>
If any of you curious about why I'm using 56.0.2, it's because I'm still using Multi Paste and Go add-on, which is a Godsend to me. It's really helpful with accessing or opening several links or images at once, oftentimes more than 30-40 images, and unfortunately the add-on is not made compatible with 69.0.2. I'm a very careful person when it comes to security and I never opened any sites with questionable or suspicious quality, just things related to work (photography) and bills (So-Net Nuro, Softbank, etc.) so please don't worry about my browsing habits or security risks. I also always disable Flash plugin.
</p><p>At this point, I really have no idea how to prevent Firefox from clearing my cache. Sometimes Firefox clears my cache when I am still browsing, sometimes when I leave it idle. Sometimes I can reach over 1 GB of cache size before Firefox clears it, sometimes Firefox clears the cache when the size is still about 100-200 MB.
</p><p>I always perform system maintenance manually (from updating OS to installing drivers, from setting up Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to making backups) so I'd rather clearing my cache manually instead of letting Firefox do that for me.
</p><p>Can any of you help me with my problem with cache?
</p><p>I appreciate and thank for the help, advice, suggestion and assistance you could provide. I don't mind using custom userChrome or userContent as long as you don't mind guiding me with it (I never used it before). 
</p><p>I'm looking forward to get your help and feedback. Thank you very much.
</p><p><br>

Suddenly this week, when I hit Enter, instead of going to the page, I get a Redirect Notice showing me what page it's about to take me to. I thought it was some Google thing but it doesn't happen on Chrome and from searching it seems it's a Firefox thing. 
</p><p>As an example, to get here, I typed mozilla support forum and I got the redirect notice shown in the attached screenshot.
</p><p>Searching tells me that the setting for this is in about:config under accessibility.blockautorefresh - just set it to false. Great. Except that's the default setting and it's already set for false. Restarting Firefox does not change things.
</p><p>I am using version 60.9.0esr (64-bit) and while it may have automatically downloaded an update earlier this week, it needs to be restarted to install it, and I did not restart Firefox between this not happening and this happening.
</p><p>I should note that it never happens when clicking a link on any website. I have seen it rarely in the past when clicking an image on Google search results, but not very often - usually I am just taken to the page where the image lives. (This is why I thought it was a Google thing.) It only happens when I type into the address bar. I have even tried opening a new, blank tab and typing and it still gives the same redirect notice. When I click the Return to the previous page link, nothing happens.
</p><p>So how can I actually turn this off? It's very annoying.

Many web pages try to send Email through the default browser; one example is WeatherBug when you click on feedback. When I do that (on Chrome, incidentally), an infinite loop seems to be created with mailto because I don't have Firefox set up to send Email (and don't particularly want to do so). When this occurs, I have to quit or sometimes force quit and reopen Firefox. It would not bother me if a single tab were created with an error message, but many, many tabs are created in that infinite loop. I suspect that this is a bug in the way Firefox processes such mailto requests.

1269949,2019-10-02 23:37:00 UTC,2019-10-03T21:12:44Z,how to get 'save this bookmark' back and how to get a longer list of favorites folders when adding a bookmark,"<p>I seem to have a related problem now, along with my original problem, that prevents me from using Firefox as my default web browser. For some reason now, all of a sudden, the menu option ""save this bookmark"" has disappeared from my list to do so!!!! I have attached a screen shot so you can see what I mean.
My main problem that I find infuriating, is when I want to save a bookmark to my long list of favorites folders (well over 300, not including the sub-folders!!) is that the number of clicks that are needed to just get the list, but once the list is accessible, all I can see is about a list of the top 5 or 6 folders!!! This takes me WAY too long to scroll through my list to find the right folder, and if I have the same named sub-folder, in multiple main folders, how do I know which one I am in, unless I scroll up and down to verify which one of the main folders I am currently in? I still use IE just because theirs is so much easier to use and doesn't take anywhere near as long to add a bookmark, but since it is so old, I keep getting a notice that it is out of date, even if it will display the webpage properly given the changes to how webpages are now programmed and IE no longer gets any updates. Chrome is even worse, given that they constantly want to keep track of you or have you log in to anything of theirs that you use, so I don't use Google.
What I want is a simple button (like what is/was) available in IE that with one click gets me a long list of my folders so that I can see my many many folders to choose from, can scroll through the list as needed to make a selection, WITH all folders and sub-folders visible, select the one I want, and if necessary an option to add a new sub-folder, and then I am done, and it closes (I have added a screen shot of what IEs list looks like and you can see the button on the top left of my favorites menu down the left hand side, to add a new bookmark)
I have counted the number of clicks needed to finish adding a bookmark in Fire fox and in IE and the number difference is ridiculous!! WHY CAN'T THIS BE SIMPLER?????
But now for some reason I can't even add a new bookmark since it is missing, so I guess Firefox no longer wants me to use their software by allowing the option from being removed! How did this happen?!
Everything about Firefox is terrific I find EXCEPT this lack of ability to simple add a bookmark to a favorite folder. This prevents me from making Firefox my go-to browser. I want to switch over, but since you make it too complicated, FORGET IT!!!! If you ever change this to something more suitable, I am all ready to make the switch, but it is seriously lacking.
</p><p>For right now I need to know how to add a bookmark, and, is there any way to tell Firefox to make the list of folders when adding a bookmark longer?

Works on other box.  .CSS issue?","<p>This question has been asked before, tried the solutions.  Adblock disabled, cookies and cache cleared, theme set to default.  About:config options tweaked to defaults.   Specific example: This wikipedia site: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations</a>  has math equations and matrix images, which fail to render.  They appear briefly, then disappear.  Flash plugin disabled.  Perhaps default .CSS files altered?  How to check this?  Note: FF menu: Tools/Page-Info/Media shows equation images fine. Also, can click on blank part of screen where image is, and right-click ""view image"", and math equations/matrix images render ok.  But page show only blank white space.  
Guys, this should not be this hard, here in 2019.  Default .CSS might have been changed in my desperate attempts to change horrible bright-white page to a dark-theme.   FIrefox with super-bright-white page is a bad experience, but blanked-out non-display-of-inline images, of course, makes Firefox sadly useless.  If I can find the solution, I will post it here.   This should *not* be this difficult.  If the image can be rendered with a right-click to view it, the browser should just render that in-line in the page, and not display a blank white space, which it does now.   This is an error that simply should not occur.

This preference is set to true and locked in my browser, and my device is not corporate controlled. Further investigating I found a config file in the /defaults/pref folder that is added by Bitdefender my anti-virus product. Two questions:
With this setting set to True, does that mean that Firefox will ignore the enabled DoH and use my configured resolvers?
How can I prevent my anti-virus product from modifying this setting? I have a support question out to them but they are dragging their feet with their response.

I spent a significant amount of time trying to move tab and address bar to the bottom of the window including address suggestion popup involved stuff several years ago when Opera was deprecated and pulled out of Gentoo repository completely. My partly working recipe was:
</p><pre>   @namespace ""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>"";
   @-moz-document url(""chrome://browser/content/browser.xul"") {
       #PopupAutoCompleteRichResult {
           /* bindings.xml in the same folder as userChrome.css */
           -moz-binding: url(""bindings.xml#urlbar-popup"") !important;
       }
       #appMenu-popup {
           -moz-binding: url(""bindings.xml#appmenu-popup"") !important;
       }
       #navigator-toolbox {
           display: contents !important;
       }
       #nav-bar {
            -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;
       }
       #TabsToolbar {
            -moz-box-ordinal-group: 3 !important;
       }
   }
</pre>
<p>While this caused slight overlap of address suggestion window/popup over top of address bar, that was pretty annoying, but still acceptable.
Recently, firefox-68.1.0 update rolled in to Gentoo stable repository. That update brought compilation against system libs and caused FF to start with an empty window. After pocking around and messing with plugins, I came to a conclusion, that this is my innocent tweaks that causes FF to start with no windows at all, so I was forced to disable this section and ended up with default layout with address and tab bar at the top of the FF window. Since I have KDE tabs at the top, this make a mess, and make it difficult to figure out whats going on.
</p><p>Since I'm not really good at CSS things, can anybody give me a hand to do the fallowing:
</p><p>1) move tab bar to the most bottom of the window;
</p><p>2) move address bar just above tab bar;
</p><p>3) make address suggestion window/popup roll UP just above address bar
</p><p>4) keep main menu (activated by Alt) stay at top where it is by default.

</p><p>Hope you are all doing well.
</p><p>On a corporate Thinkpad T480 running Windows 10 Version 1803 OS Build 17134.1006 Firefox is crashing daily. Chrome or IE doesn't have the same problem.
Troubleshooting performed so far:
1. Tried running Firefox for a full day in Safe Mode: Still crashes - bp-d9e945ed-e475-4b92-a449-e3b620191002
2. Tried ESR version of Firefox - no improvement.
3. Re-installed Firefox a few times - no improvement.
4. Chrome, IE, Edge do not have the same problem but they are not Firefox : )
5. Reviewed the Firefox crashes knowledge base and tried everything listed there. Last test was to use Firefox for a day in Safe Mode (wasn't easy but I coped with it)
</p><p>Something i've noticed (not 100% sure about it) is that if I leave a private window open the crash is somehow more likely to occur.
</p><p>So far my observations are that this is some sort of a memory leak-like problem as just before the crash tabs on the browser and some content on pages becomes blank when I hover over with the mouse. Task Manager shows very high Memory usage 1,5-2 GBs.
</p><p>Any and all advises are welcomed. Thank you!

1269899,2019-10-02 01:52:16 UTC,2019-10-02T12:00:20Z,Bookmarks toolbar randomly rearranges itself,"<p>This issue has been around for years with no actual solution.  I recently finally got around to disconnecting three of my devices (laptop, Samsung tablet and Samsung smartphone) from Firefox Sync in order to determine if the problem is sync-related. The bookmarks toolbar on my main device (another laptop) were still being randomly rearranged. I therefore disconnected this laptop from sync as well. The bookmarks toolbar has since been stable with no rearranging. This is telling me that this is a sync issue, not an issue with a corrupt places.sqlite file, an add-on/plug-in or hardware acceleration, as previously suggested by Mozilla, which was then marked as a solution. Sync has often been quite useful, but since I have my bookmarks (folders) arranged in alphabetical order on the toolbar for quick access and use them all frequently, I'd rather forego sync than deal with constant reordering of the bookmarks toolbar. I gather from what I've read that this problem also exists in the Google Chrome web browser. Even if the problem is a corrupted places.sqlite file, surely the sheer number of users experiencing the issue would suggest a bug or vulnerability with that file, irrespective of what add-ons are installed since the likelihood of all those users having the same add-on(s) installed is probably minimal.  Surely it's about time Mozilla properly investigated (e.g. what add-on(s) is causing the issue, how the places.sqlite file can become corrupted, how sync is causing the problem, etc., etc. and disseminating the findings to users) and actually solved this issue instead of expecting users (the IT-savvy ones at least) to waste time doing their own futile troubleshooting. I really don't think that I should have had to disconnect from sync in order to ""fix"" this problem.

I use smart keywords to go to different subreddits, so for example searching for ""r askreddit"" goes to <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com/r/AskReddit</a>. The issue I have is that if I want to go to the front page, I can't just search for ""r"", as that goes to <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/</a> which then redirects to <a href=""http://reddit.com/subreddits"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com/subreddits</a>.
</p><p>So what I'd want is to have an if-then statement - if there is no other argument following the ""r"", it should go to <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a>. This works with Google Maps and YouTube without needing to do anything /Google handles empty search differently than reddit I suppose/.

You'd think that this browser would wake up and remember what users are inputting.  There are few things more aggravating than being asked the same question over and over.  It is utterly astounding that so many software designers seem to be unable to comprehend this.  I wonder if they are truly living in another dimension.  To think that so much of our lives are controlled by these mindless idiots is so sad.  No wonder so much of our society is so inefficient.  
The problem seems to be centered on calling with Gmail.  Calling with Google Hangouts seems to be fine.  It may be a Flash problem.  Probably as Adobe is such a horrible company, being so intrusive and stubborn in so much of their products.  I guess Google chose them as a lesser of several evils.  The thing is I've gone into Control Panel, Flash Player (though it says its 32 bit and I'm on a 64 bit system) and allowed <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> yet it still doesn't make a difference.  In Firefox Permissions (hey, how come about:permissions no longer works?) I see <a href=""http://Hangouts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Hangouts.google.com</a> is there but <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> is not there even though I've allowed it 100 times.  Why would it not be retained?  That is probably the problem.  And looking at that stupid Permissions page is so aggravating.  Such a total design failure.  You can Remove All Websites, but you can't ADD ANY WEBSITES.  IDIOTS!!!!  If I could, Gmail wouldn't ask me every time I laod or refresh the page.  Just think:  People are actually getting paid, often very well, for moronic work like this.  Boggles the mind.

Pain in the rump to visit hundreds of imported bookmarks in order to refresh favicons, and even this doesn't work for all of them - some mysteriously won't display while they display just fine in other browsers.

Just venting, not necessarily looking for a fix unless there's an add-in that will do this automatically for the latest version of FF.

How can I discover which tab(s) is/are resposnible for high CPU usage ?,"<p>I have a lot of Firefox windows with multiple tabs in each (this is my way of working ...). I can see in the Activity Monitor that the Firefox is the most active application in terms of CPU and energy consumption on my Mac (it just drains battery ..). I used the Task Manager but it doesn't help much. Is there any better, more detailed way how to display which tab could be blamed for CPU usage ?

</p><p>My ""Windows 10"" &amp; ""GPU driver"" are also up-to-date.
</p><p>This happens to me usually when My CPU is %100 (for doing other things like converting in the background). As soon as CPU usage goes lower than %100, The problem goes away.
</p><p>Enabling Hardware Acceleration in firefox, sometimes helps, But not always.
</p><p>Also I must say that I didn't have this problem before (maybe 1or 2 months ago), Until the last 2 or 3 versions of Firefox. So I'm sure its something to do with a new option that has been added to firefox lately.
