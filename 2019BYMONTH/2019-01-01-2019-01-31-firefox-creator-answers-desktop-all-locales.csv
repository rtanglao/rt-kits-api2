When my Firefox for Mac auto-upgraded to 65.0 I could only download one book from the website, but could no longer download any others using the Premium downloader.  If I download without the Premium downloader it'll download but it's a real PIA, that's why I pay for Premium.  I reverted back to 64.0.2 and all was well.  Thus, I went and changed the Firefox setting to always ask me about updating.  Despite that it updated automatically the next time I used it.  Same Premium downloading problem with mobilism, which downgrading to 64.0.2 solved once again. 
</p><p>With 65.0 in Mobilism, I'm never given the option to download the second time, the downloading  box just locks up.  I tried disabling all ad and content blockers, as well as my script blocker, and everything I could think of with no change.

Before I updated Firefox to 65.0 today, I was able to use the ""Awesome Bar"" without it ever displaying any suggestions at all. ""Provide search suggestions"" is disabled in Preferences &gt; Search, as are all three of ""Browsing history"", ""Bookmarks"", and ""Open tabs"" in Preferences &gt; Privacy &amp; Security.
I have not changed any of these settings since I updated the software, but now whenever I type anything into the address bar it still shows up a bar suggesting only what I type along with the one-click suggestions.
I would prefer to completely disable all of drop-down suggestions entirely, and I'm not sure how to go about doing this. If it's a feature that was removed in this update (which seems probable) hopefully there can be a way to reverse that.

I've been scouring the different settings and config, but can't find any way to do this. Is there any way to do this? If not, are there any addons that add this functionality? If not for either of those questions, could someone with some coding knowledge point me in the right direction in terms of how I'd set something like this up? I can use some basic php, html/css/javascript, VBS, and batch script language if anyone thinks there's a way to set it up using any of those.

No server, just local web pages on the system. The system allows our non-profit museum's visitors to get information on any of the 150+ artifacts we have, each one being a web page. Firefox starts with the homepage, then the user can go into the desired web page by touching the screen. Mkiosk can detect when the user has not done anything for a set period (2 minutes in our case) and then it resets back to the home screen. Works like a charm! No apache server needed or wanted for simplicity - just a bunch of pages and links.
However, I want to be able to either do other (non-firefox) things when the home web page has been showing for 5 minutes (which means nobody is using the system). Some things are 
1) Outputting a voice message to invite users to try the system
2) Bringing up a different firefox profile with an entirely different set of pages
3) Bringing up a different application on the screen.

</p><p>Is there any way to see from firefox's files or from a communication from firefox (like having it log to a file which I could read) so I can tell what file is being displayed on the screen at any point in time (or just to know when the homepage is being displayed)?

I would check the screenshot with alt+tab, then alt+tab back to the browser, type part of the string (lets say 4 characters), then alt+tab back to the image to check the rest of it... Now whenever i alt+tab back to the browser, it would select the entire text inside the password container instead of just leaving it as it is, thus making me replace the text I've already typed instead of just adding to it. That also happens a lot with the address bar.
Now I'm a pretty unfocused individual, and I know I can press the right arrow key on the keyboard to just avoid this selection, but it seems like firefox is the only browser who does that sort of thing and it always gets me on surprise. Then I have this whole frustration moment, because that usually happens when I got to rush and log in, and when I'm already finishing the input.
Is there any way to force firefox to stop this selection madness?
Any help will be appreciated, and thank you all for your time. I hope I was clear enough...

We're a TLS everywhere, VPN everywhere shop. We very much know the implications of security workarounds. TL;DR: Shibboleet.
</p><p>While deploying our systems, we routinely have to directly access our customers' legacy systems that are ridden with SSL/TLS problems of almost every category: outdated algorithms, inadequate key lengths, hardcoded certificates, reused serials and so on. Some of these limitations can be worked around in the browser, others require configuring insecure settings, a few cannot be done away with. ""Contacting the site admininistrator and letting them know there's something wrong with their site"" is a non-option here. We're talking about *unfixable* systems whose design life is measured in two-digit years.
</p><p>The question is: how am I supposed to cope with this? Where is the big red switch to throw security out of the window for RFC1918 networks for the next half an hour? Where can I donate my left kidney? Where is the altar where I can sacrifice a goat to your preferred deity?

</p><p>What I know:
- Making a new profile on the same machine solves it, but only for that new profile
- Alt-menu and the main menu are affected, but about: pages are all in English
- Some sections of the main menu are in English in the middle of the French: The button to open Pocket, the button to open my screenshots, the button for the content blocker, and a seemingly random bunch of the dev tools' names
</p><p>What I tried (with little success):
- Reinstalling, making sure I took an en-US download
- Disabling matchOS in about:config (my operating system is in English anyways)
- Setting my requested language to ""en"" or ""en-US"" in about:config
- Language packs, remove all but English (tried removing English too, for experimental purposes)
- Checked the Firefox language settings, there's only English in the list
- Same as above for website language settings

</p><p>Basically, all the shorcut involve a combination with the alt key, but since tuesday, when I press the alt key, I have the menu appearing or disappearing above my open tabs at the top of the Firefox window so I guess Firefox doesn't understand that the shorcuts are for XTM.

I can refresh and the site will load but then if I got to another page of the same website or a different site the error will just appear again.

After turning it off in background using Task Manager whenever it would open, I tried to access it several ways... creating a new profile (opens in background only), checking shortcut pathways, deleting a potentially corrupted program file, and doing a clean install (starting with downloading a new installation). The clean install sort of works

Just a simple use case. take one of these urls:
data:text/html,&lt;input type=""text""&gt;
data:text/html,&lt;textarea&gt;
data:text/html,
Enter some data and save the page. Entered data will be saved as well.
Currently, I have two Firefox profiles on two different Linux (Ubuntu) machines when Firefox doesn't save input fields while I am using these profiles. When I create another profiles, input fields are saved again.  So, it is profile based issue. Firstly I noticed this strange behavior several years ago. Then I created a new profile and imported everything from the ""bad"" one. I am still keeping that ""bad"" profile on my old Ubuntu box. Now I have two more ""bad"" profiles on two different boxes.
Is there any explanation of this behavior? Is it just a bug?

Now, when I type in a web address into the address/url field, an additional task bar under underneath it suddenly appears and I guess it's searching for web sites that I'm trying to type in as I'm typing it in.  And under that is another task bar with the icons for google, bing, amazon etc.  I do not want either task bar to pop up.   I just want to type in the address without anything happening,  just like it was before the update.

</p><p>Yes, I went into ""Options"" - ""Privacy and Security""  - down to history - brought up the ""use custom settings for history"" and unchecked the boxes. I also unchecked the boxes for the ""Address bar"" settings.

</p><p>I also tried setting it to ""remember my history"" (because I do), but those two task bars keep appearing.

Unfortunately, if you have configured the Firefox setting of ""Block cookies and site data"" to ""Cookies from unvisited websites"", my iframe widgets no longer work when used on a cross origin domain, as they rely on user sessions.  Is there any documentation that defines what 3rd party cookies are?  I understand some users want to block them (as I myself was doing until I realized that would break my iframe widgets), but what I don't understand is why the cookies are continually blocked if a user specifically interacts with an iframe widget.  Doesn't user interaction imply it's now a visited website?  I should think the first load of the iframe would trigger blocked cookies, but if the user interacts with the iframe content willingly (by clicking a button which triggers an ajax call, for example), any resulting cookies should be respected even if Firefox is set to block 3rd party cookies.  I'm all for blocking 3rd party cookies that are loaded dynamically and are unwelcome, but if the user starts interacting with these iframes or controls, it would make sense to allow cookies, and that would be enough for my apps to not be broken if the user blocks 3rd party cookies.  I think web developers need a solution for keeping their legitimate cross origin apps from being blocked by 3rd party cookie settings if users are interacting and using them.
</p><p>I put together a sample application that shows how Firefox blocking third party cookies completely breaks sessions (since the cookie that is returned from the iframe call is discarded / not used).

</p><p>I created a basic test to see if I could get Firefox to maintain sessions with iframes using a cross origin domain as the source. Unfortunately, I could not. Is there any work-around, or an easy way to detect the user's 3rd party cookie settings so I can warn them? I'd still like to know what is considered 3rd party, and what happens if you visit the cross origin domain directly in another tab before interacting with that iframe. Is it still considered 3rd party then?  What is the behavior and rules for this?  
</p><p>This seems like a serious problem that needs a better solution, and I like the interaction idea.

Whenever I try to copy and paste an image, it adds a white film over top of it. In the attached image, the left is a screenshot of an image, and the right is the image copied directly from Firefox. At the top is two colours picked from the same spot on each image, showing that the colour is definitely lighter when its copied rather than screenshotted or saved. Is this intentional? If so I might have to move back to Chrome. I don't want to but I can't find any way to fix this.

</p><p>I've tried to google and look into this forums, I've seen people reporting similar issues (but not lately) and I've tried various fixes suggested here and there, for example:
</p><p>- Disabling all extensions
</p><p>- Disabling Hardware Acceleration
</p><p>- Reseting my profile
</p><p>- Reinstalling Firefox
</p><p>- Heck I've even reinstalled my Windows
</p><p><br>
Not once has the closing triggered crash report.
</p><p>I don't have any similar issues with any other software on my computer so it must be something Firefox specific.
I've monitored my PC resource usage, thought maybe somehow it hogs up all my CPU, RAM or disk and that makes it close - nope, same haeppens even when CPU usage is 20%, RAM 12 of 32GB, disk 0-5% (SSDs) etc.
</p><p>Honestly I'm out of ideas what to try and if we somebody can't help me find a solution I sadly may have to abandon Firefox once again (which I really would not like to do)

That is annoying! I like to use Firefox the most but do not know what to do more. 
Just for you to  know, Chrome and even Edge does not have such a behavior and both cam and mike are correctly installed and device drivers are up to date. Firefox  Privacy settings are already set for allowing microphone and camera on all microphone demanding sites I use (in this case Facebook Messenger). There are no restrictions applied by Win10 Pro for those devices. Could not find any good in the forums related to this behavior.
My version of Firefox is 65.0 (64-bit). Should I drop it and use Chrome?

1248366,2019-01-30 17:26:09 UTC,2019-03-18T11:12:02Z,How do I move the tabs on bottom (directly above webpage) and while Private Browsing ? FF65,"<p>Basically Firefox 65 rolled up and brought back the tabs on top and broke the css. I want the tabs to be right above the webpage. Like this: <a href=""https://imgur.com/v6byBhV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/v6byBhV</a>
</p><p>I currently have a css code I found that I'm using to achieve that result:
</p><p><code>
</code></p><p><code>/* TABS: on bottom */
</code></p><pre><code>#navigator-toolbox toolbar:not(#nav-bar):not(#toolbar-menubar) {-moz-box-ordinal-group:10}
#TabsToolbar {-moz-box-ordinal-group:1000!important}

#TabsToolbar {
position: absolute !important;
bottom: 0 !important;
width: 100vw !important;
}

#tabbrowser-tabs {
 width: 100vw !important;
}
#main-window:not([chromehidden*=""toolbar""]) #navigator-toolbox {padding-bottom: var(--tab-min-height) !important;}

</code></pre><code>
</code><p><code></code>
</p><p>I don't know what's important and what isn't, so I haven't touched it much.
</p><p>The problem though is that in Private Browsing it gets messed up. Here's what I mean: <a href=""https://imgur.com/PQ8ZjVp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/PQ8ZjVp</a>
I have 2 tabs opened there.
</p><p>(Also I just noticed how Youtube's search bar doesn't appear, that's because it has been moved slightly off the of where I cropped the screenshot. Not the code's fault since I tried without it. Private browsing caused that which makes me question what else changes)
</p><p>After some searching I found this code:
</p><p><code>
</code></p><pre><code>#TabsToolbar:not([inFullscreen=""true""]) &gt; .private-browsing-indicator {
position: absolute !important;
right: 0;
bottom: 1px;
}
</code></pre><code>
</code><p><code></code>
</p><p>But then that introduces this problem: <a href=""https://imgur.com/kO5w538"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/kO5w538</a> the Private Browsing icon overlaps with the ""open a new tab"" icon or the ""List all tabs"" icon if there are too many tabs open. That makes me believe that at some point, the mask icon was detached or something. 
</p><p>I would appreciate some help for either a new code for moving the tabs to the bottom, or fixing the Private Browsing tab.

</p><p>Windows 10 Pro; 64-bit; all updates present; all operations normal and stable... up until the subject event.
</p><p>I was minimizing my browser while working in my eMail client (Thunderbird). Firefox is default, so clicking links from Thunderbird is normally seamless.

</p><p>When I attempted to maximize Firefox from the taskbar, it would not respond... It took about a moment for me to scratch my head, survey my desktop for anomalies or threat warning dialogs, messages, notices, etc., when Firefox icon disappeared and the Firefox update status bar information dialog flashed on my screen, saying something like ""please wait for Firefox to refresh..."" when it disappeared being instantly replaced by the updated Firefox's 'welcome screen' but in a new style which obscured nearly 3/4's of my desktop.
</p><p>After surveying the changes and NOTING FOR THE RECORD THAT ALL MY ADD-ONS AND EXTENSIONS HAD BEEN OBLITERATED WITHOUT ANY NOTICE WHATSOEVER, I resized my browser back to normal - which seems to have stuck and remains stable - where I discovered the 'Old Firefox Data' on my desktop:

</p><p>It would be very nice and minimally respectful:  to have been warned prior to such an invasive update; to be given an option to delay and prepare to accept the update - which deviates significantly from normal updates; and/or to publish some explanation and information and A LINK to a summary explanation with your braggadocios 'Welcome' page.
</p><p>As a manageable aside, many of the settings (under the Tools &gt; Options menu) were also arbitrarily changed, most notably the desired default start page(s) and the manner to reset them. Most of the new defaults were not particularly dangerous however many more default settings tend to be a bit invasive and as the wording for each category changed significantly, a bit of research had to be done to analyze and determine whether to retain or change each and every one of these - which in no way matched the previous configuration I had so diligently conformed and maintained for quite a long time...
</p><p>I shouldn't need to compose a detailed complex question for true appropriate experts to project into this situation and conceive, formulate, and promulgate an appropriate constructive informative suggestive response with some variables and options for the many other Firefox clients who will likely experience this same trauma to an otherwise beautiful start of the day...
</p><p>Searching the help files and groups, the responses are non-responses and circle-logic which tend to justify placing a folder on the desktop - and various other arbitrary and capricious anomalies - in the first place without further explanation or options or suggestions... I am genuinely amazed that any of these non-responsive response have been archived and maintained as acceptable while the situation/situations seem to persist without any procedure or reasonable remedy to avoid it/them in the first place.
</p><p>I realize that Firefox is ""free"" and many dedicated experts selflessly sacrifice your experience and expertise to improve the internet browsing experience and generally make this imperfect world a better place in which to live, evolve, and thrive, but for your apparently socially uninformed information and for the record: it is NOT reasonable to expect people to be grateful for a reach-around when they didn't want the butt-raping in the first place.
</p><p>Please publish some options that may address my restoring my browser to it's previous comfortable settings using the 'Old Firefox Data' folder and/or its contents.
</p><p>PROCESSING NOTE: Uploading an image with this newly updated Firefox just glitched... looks like a Flash or Shockwave compatibility error from the progress icon. The Options &gt; Tools &gt; Add-ons and Extensions newly designed interfaces are not revealing any useful information... perhaps this new Firefox update categorizes its own image upload interface routine as ""dangerous""??? 
</p><p>I'll insert a directory list... above... if I can safely exit this setback...

I cannot control text inside search box of Duckduckgo on Firefox; using shortcuts like Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right, Ctrl+Left/Right causes some behaviour or text selection to happen, outside the text box that was active at the time when shortcuts were performed (I have tested with all plugins both disabled and enabled, and with shortcuts turned both on and off in duckduckgo's settings). I am not sure if it is an issue with Firefox itself because same shortcuts seem to work in google search box.

I dunno was I obligated to set up sync before I did the reset? Nothing told me to do so or how to do it. I'm typing this on Chrome because it's still working OK but none of the pages come up on Firefox anymore. Can anyone explain how I can back this out of this disastrous condition? How would I know exactly what was causing it to be all but shut down like this? Tell me is this some kind of drastic overkill on security or something? Is there some SIMPLE test I can perform to quickly figure out what needs to be changed? The ONLY reason I did this was BEFORE I STARTED I couldn't get any downloads to proceed beyond zero bytes in size, so for right now I even bypassed Windows Firewall so I'm ""wide open"" looking for a solution, PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS THING WORKING AGAIN ASAP!!!

- if I add 2-3 more spaces, the same thing happens - all the spaces are removed when I start typing the next word
- if I hold down the space bar and let auto-space insert (6-8 spaces), the next word types correctly (no spaces are removed)

- it seems to happen only on one website - I can enter words on other sites on this browser (such as what I'm typing now)

If Mozilla can make it work on Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Echo, I'm sure they can make it work on Apple TV in addition to those two Amazon devices!

</p><p>I save some of my bookmarks by deleting their ""name"" and using only the icon, so as to have a dense selection of pages I frequently visit. One of which is the Google Calendar. While I was using Chrome, each time I opened the Calendar, the bookmark icon used to refresh, by writing the proper date on it.
</p><p>For example, visiting the website today, the 27th, the icon would change its text from ""26"" to ""27"". In Firefox though, it is stuck on the 25th (the day I made the switch). Is there something I should look into? Thanks

It stopped opening automatically Magnet links (probably after one of the updates).
Thus, I started to look how to set it up again.
After I set network.protocol-handler.expose.magnet Firefox asked me what application to use (as expected).
Nevertheless, it did not seem to be launching the application. 
In order to debug this, I created a script file with the following content:
echo ""X"" &gt; ~/out
and associated this script file with magnet protocol, by choosing this script file from the list of ""applications"" that pops up after I click on the magnet link.
After I confirm to Firefox by pressing ""Open File"" nothing happens and the ""out"" file is not created - thus I conclude that Firefox is not executing the ""application"" (my script file in this case) at all.
</p><p>It must have changed recently, how can I force Firefox to run an external application?

Then Firefox itself crashed, and now every time I try to run it it crashes - even if started in Safe Mode by means of Shift+Click.

These add-ons were Auto Tab Discard, Tree Style Tab, OneTab and Tabliss (the latter two were disabled at the time of the crash).

1247897,2019-01-26 13:21:49 UTC,2019-02-13T15:42:21Z,Considerations when upgrading from V41 or V43,"<p>Long time user (15-20 yrs?), I have been avoiding the ""next"" upgrade for several years for various reasons (hate change, fave add-ons go away, hate change, not broke-don't fix, hate change...).  But I am now running into a few websites that won't permit this browser, so it may be time to move on.    With heavy adblocking and tracker-blocking and my benign web browsing habits, I've not been concerned about security (never had a virus in 20 years - knock wood).  It's just full functionality and slowness at this point.  At this point, I see even my Classic Theme Restorer is no longer available, so I'll just have to bite the bullet on aesthetics and deal with a modern browser.   However, a couple of things are unclear:
</p><p>1. does 20 years of bookmark history (and remembered history) affect memory footprint.  I only refer to existing bookmarks occasionally these days and may consider a full purge.  Partial purge would probably be too time-consuming.  Maybe even a full profile purge might be worthwhile for a true clean slate.  Maybe FF has come a long way and old extensions and settings won't be necessary.  I also have several about: settings that I may (or may not?) miss.
</p><p>2.  Are automatic updates unavoidable in newer versions?   I read about ""manual"" but it sounded temporary.
</p><p>3.   The permissions on many potential add-ons I've looked at are quite unnerving... e.g many of them require full access to ALL my data (usernames and passwords!!!) and I know the function has no need for such.    Who has time to investigate these fully for safety?  Is there any anti-malware vetting required for add-ons to be available?
</p><p>4.  I know newer is generally faster, but FF has a history of growing and slowing down after upgrades.  My hardware isn't getting any newer (although its more than ample for my current needs), but software tends to be developed on latest and greatest hardware.  How does latest FF compare to circa V41 in memory usage?
</p><p><br>
In any case, I thought I would give the latest vesion a whirl on my old Vista laptop (which is currently at V43) and check it out before plunging in on my W7 work PC or home PC.    Any answers or insight into such a big jump are much appreciated.

WPF Client application hits the service hosted on an application server.
Till last month when the proxy was in place, google map and street view were displayed without any issue. 
Now we have removed the proxy (because of company's some strange policy).  Now if we open the WPF application from desktop google street view is not showing, once we drop man icon on google map, it just shows black screen (attachment 1, attachment 2 and attachment 3).
Attachment 1---Google map visible
Attachment 2---Dropping the man icon( point to be noted that thumbnails are still visible)
Attachment 3-- as soon as you drop the man icon, only black screen appears.
</p><p>But if we open the WPF application from the app server where service are installed, it worked fine and shows google street view without any issue.
</p><p>Could you please help as what could be problem

</p><p>I checked previous answers about the ""no-remote"" option and the ""MOZ_NO_REMOTE"" environment variable. Both are not set, so these solution did not help me.

</p><p>I do not have several profiles, my current profile is the default profile.
I am not in private browsing mode and all ""Browser.link.open"" in about:config are set to default.
</p><p>Can anyone please help me with this issue?

I use FF on at least 4 different Macs, and for some reason a fresh install on a brand new MacBook Pro (2018 USB-C) is hanging constantly. Works fine on every other Mac I have. All Macs on are the latest OS (10.14.2), all have the latest FF (64.0.2). But for some reason this one instance will not work.
</p><p>On some sites, it seems to hang randomly. I usually have several tabs pinned and open, sometimes those tabs will hang when they reload themselves (<a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, Remember the Milk, Yahoo mail, etc). Sometimes a website in a new tab will hang - but if I close the tab and go to the same site/link in a new tab, it will load fine. Once one tab hangs, it seems to cause other tabs to start hanging, but not 100% sure about that. 
</p><p>But there are two sites that ALWAYS cause it to hang: <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> and the Firefox Troubleshooting page. For Amazon, that one tab will hang and I can usually close that tab (takes a few seconds to close). For Troubleshooting page, it locks up the whole app and I have to force quit.
</p><p>Safe mode DOES work. I can get to Amazon and Troubleshooting page. But on a clean fresh install with no extensions installed (or enabled, see below), these pages will still hang. Is there another difference with Safe Mode?
</p><p>Note that this is on a laptop that is provided by my employer and it's possible that there's some other software involved. For example, there are two plugins already there even on a fresh install: OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems and Widevine Content Decryption Module provided by Google. I can't seem to remove them. (I have another Mac at home that runs on Cisco's network, but I don't know what it has installed - not there now, I can check this later if it's relevant.) However, my previous work laptop (2015 MacBook Pro) did not have these problems - also latest OS and latest FF.
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling (delete the app, remove the Application Support folders for Mozilla and Firefox, remove my profile). I've tried Refreshing Firefox. Nothing works except Safe Mode.
</p><p>I've attached the troubleshooting JSON info while in Safe Mode. I do have LastPass installed now, but I tested without it, too.
</p><p>Please help! I depend heavily on Firefox (bookmarks sync and some key plugins) and I'm not willing to use anything else, unless I just can't fix this.

</p><p>On Mac, Firefox 56 ratcheted up the security sandbox, limiting which files pages can use on your system. This apparently prevents Firefox from using font files in a ""suitcase"" or ""Adobe Type 1"" format. The developers are aware of this and some fixes were made in Firefox 57, but they might have missed some font types or unexpected font file locations.
</p><p>To see whether this is the problem, and as a temporary workaround, you can reduce the sandbox security level back to what it was in Firefox 52-55 as follows:
</p><p>(1) In a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Return. Click the button accepting the risk.
</p><p>(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste sand and pause while the list is filtered
</p><p>(3) Double-click the security.sandbox.content.level preference and change the value from 3 to 1 and click OK
</p><p>That change won't take effect until the next time you quit and restart Firefox

</p><p>Sauf que ""L'ancien processus Firefox"" est Firefox Quantum (qui fonctionne parfaitement). Si je clique sur ""Fermer Firefox"" ça ferme Quantum et ouvre Firefox avec les onglets précédemment fermé.
</p><p>J'ai un autre problème. Si je me connecte à Firefox Sync sur Quantum ça me connecte à ce compte aussi sur Firefox normal. Or, je rappel que j'ai deux compte Sync, un pour le travail sur Quantum et un autre pour Firefox. Et chacun des compte ont des modules différents, des marques pages différent etc.

I am trying to *make* (not view) a web page in which Chinese and English are mixed within sentences.  I want the Chinese text to be displayed in a kaiti font regardless of operating system.

But I keep getting a ming font unless the font-family list starts with ""ur pl ukai cn"" (the kaiti font on my Fedora system).
</p><p>the question:
When Mozilla coded Firefox, what was programmed as the ""generic family"" for Chinese kaiti fonts?
</p><p>By the way, according to W3C (""<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/</a>""), the ""generic family"" for kaiti fonts should be ""cursive"" (without the quotes).

</p><p>I've set a proxy in network connetion settings, no-proxy just for {localhost; 127.0.0.1}, same for both http and https.
Thus all external traffic should flow through the proxy.
Instead, while e.g. <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.technologyreview.com/</a> goes via proxy, <a href=""https://cdn.technologyreview.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cdn.technologyreview.com/</a> doesn't: if I set a rule in the proxy to block .technologyreview.com the cdn sub is unaffected.
'https://cdn' in the urlbar looks grayed-out like 'https://support' for this site.
I see no corresponding 'hidden' exception in the about:config to explain this.
Also, oddly enough, went to extensions manager, disabled all then the cdn part was no more gray and reloading the url it got blocked as expected. 
But then re-activating the extensions nothing changed. 
And retrying same procedure after close &amp; restart of FF did not yield same result, i.e. https//cdn always gray and bypassed proxy.

I called Autonews and their tech said to try it with Google Chrome. I did and with that browser the Autonews videos play OK just like it used to with Firefox -( which I like better). Thus a Firefox issue. They told me to try clearing my firefox 'History' which I did- for 'one day' but no help.  I also see some type of ""refresh"" procedure that may help but I am afraid to do It and loose all my Firefox bookmarks. I am obviously a computer novice so anyone that can give me some detailed help info. as to how to fix my problem -I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT!

I would naturally also like to block any forms of redirection from within websites, say I'm using a website, and I click on something, and that either opens a new window, or loads a different website in the current window, I would like to prevent that entirely. Is this possible, and if so, how would I go by doing it?

The first 3-5 seconds any keyword attached to a bookmark that I type results in firefox trying to literally resolve that string as a domain name instead of activating the associated bookmark. Also, if after the browser windo appears I open the bookmarks menu, I literally see the menu being built step by step.
</p><p>I have 944 bookmarks spread across 73 (sub)folders, so I would expect this to be faster. Also, in Firefox before quantum it was so much faster that I never noticed an issue. Running Firefox in safe mode helps a bit and brings loading time down to 2-3 seconds, but is still slow.

Estou com o seguinte problema: de uma semana para cá, os botões de opção (radio buttons) do Firefox travam o programa. Por exemplo, ao fazer um download de qualquer arquivo, ele pergunta se quer salvar ou abrir com um programa. Clica-se na opção desejada, que não é imediatamente marcada, a tela fica cinza e demora um tempão até a opção aparecer marcada. O mesmo ocorre com a máquina não conectada à internet, tentando configurar o proxy, opções de salvamento, enfim, tudo que dependa de radio buttons. Às vezes aparece uma janela me avisando que um script travou, em geral é chrome://global/content/customElements.js:203 quando estou tentando configurar o proxy. Já desinstalei e reinstalei, tentei safe mode, sem extensões, com perfil novo, nada deu certo. A máquina é um notebook Dell Vostro rodando Ubuntu 16.04 LTS e nunca havia dado esse tipo de problema.

</p><p>First of all, I'd like to thank you all for all the great work you're doing ;)
</p><p>Now, let's me explain the issue.
For the second time in 3 weeks or so, my Mozilla Firefox browser (version 64.0.2) isn't showing anything when launched. And by anything, I mean it does not load or show any webpage, neither locally or the distant webpage, it just show a grey background as shown in the image. Btw, it's not crashing at all, it's just not displaying anything.
Clicking on the menu icon open it, but clicking on any item just do strictly nothing. 
Trying to access ""about:&lt;anything&gt;"" just start a never ending load of the page, so do trying to access any web ressources. 
</p><p>I've already tried some things, but none of them work : 
</p><pre>- Launch in safe mode, 
- Use the repair tool,
- Uninstall and reinstall.
</pre>
<p>I've also looked up if there was some error log file in the AppData folder, but nothing. 
</p><p><br>
Last time, I managed to repair this by uninstalling, and removing strictly anything related to Firefox on my computer (Windows 10 Familly), and installed it back, but tbh, I'd like not to reinstall the browser every 2 weeks or so, as it takes me half an hour to download it, thanks to my great internet connection.
</p><p>If missing some information, or unclear point, I can add on demand. 
Excuse me in advance for any English mistakes or mishaps.
</p><p>Thanks !

Onko odotettavissa parannusta asiaan, vai onko tulevaisuus Edgen?
Parisen vuotta sitten väkisin väänsin tunnistamiseen tarvittavat lisäosat Firefoxiin. Systeemi toimi moitteetta, mutta söi prosessorin tehoa kohtuuttoman paljon myös joutilaana ollessaan.

</p><p>I decided to give it another try, since I've been with it from the very beginning.
</p><p>I was using FVD Speeddial on Opera until they broke speedials so they could put their ads on the front page. Then i switched to Chrome, and it was easy because it has FVD Speeddial as well. I'm really definitely no fan of cloud backups to random companies, but it seems Firefox has gone the same way, FVD Speeddial is the only decent option on Firefox now, and When trying to make that my home-page, it was a bit tricky/shady.
</p><p>Anyway, Copying and Pasting from Chrome to Word is a breeze, everything is retained, colors, fonts, line spacing everything. I really thought that was just any browsers capability. I'm certain Firefox of old never had this problem, but when I tried to Copy and Paste from FireFox all the formatting was lost. This is a brand New Installation, with only FVD SpeedDial installed as the only add-on. I thought it was a problem with my Office at first. I couldn't believe Firefox broke everything. 
</p><p>Anyway, you guys are really just not doing well anymore, and I don't know why or wtf happened. it's almost like you just dgaf anymore.

Stop changing the layout and features that people get use to using. I can understand security patches being updatable but the end user should have the option of just downloading certain features and security updates. You can't have users that are used to manipulating a version they like lose most of the features and layout they enjoy. Part of the reason I recommend Firefox to absolutely everyone I talk to is because it's the ultimate browser for the common and majority of users. That is until this last release that I kept getting messages saying I have to update I hate the new latest version with a passion and its starting to make Chrome or IE look like good alternatives when they never were before.

If I have more than one tab open, and I click to close Firefox, I'll get the popup confirming I want to close all tabs. When I click on cancel, the page will show the main feed. 
I've disabled add ons and restarted Firefox and still have the same issue. I've checked my cookie settings and Facebook is one of the exceptions to be blocked. Add ons are all up to date and Firefox is as well. I still seem to get the same issue. 
I've tried Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and don't have the problem.

I want my previous version back. And don`t tell me to go on your website and download and older version.
Short: how do I roll back this stupid update to get back to the state before, a version that worked pretty fine.

Banking and gaming sites do well, but Chrome is faster, though I prefer Firefox for its security, supposed speed and not being part of Google. Those same sites also do not auto-fill when I start to type them in the address bar.
I suppose the easy answer is to use Chrome on those troublesome sites, but I was wondering if I'm missing something. 
I have quite a few log-ins and favorites saved, so I'm hesitant to re-install it or clear history.

This loop continues.  From that point pressing the end key or the home key does nothing.  At other times, the keys perform as expected.  At still other times the Down arrow performs END, and Up arrow performs HOME. The HOME and END KEYS seem to move the cursor left and right within the element which has the FOCUS.
</p><p>The Chrome browser works fine.
</p><p>I have two computers running Windows 7 Professional.  My laptop is a Lenovo X220.  My Desktop is a homebuilt PC based on a Gigabyte motherboard.  The laptop is a refurb bought from Amazon in August 2016 and came with Windows 7 professional installed. The PC's Win 7 was installed from a system builder ""Intended for Distribution with a refurbished PC"" disc about 2 1/2 years ago (June 2016).  Both machines have been running without any significant problems until several months ago.  Now both have the same problem, while another pc running linux mint does not have the problem.
</p><p>I have restarted Firefox with add-ons disabled and the problem persists, so I don't believe it is caused by any of the add-ons. I swapped out multiple keyboards, checked both machines for malware using Malwarebytes, restarted Firefox and rebooted the computers several times, and tried running without Microsoft Security Essentials; I decided the Firefox profiles must be the source of the problem, so on Jan 12, 2019 I completely uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox on the PC and it worked fine (keyboard problem gone) so I did the same thing on the laptop, and it also worked correctly.  I figured the problem was gone.  Then, four days later (the 16th) the problem restarted, on both machines.
</p><p>I am wondering if there might be a problem with a Firefox or Windows update, since the keyboard issue occurred at roughly the same time on both machines.  It seems odd that both computers worked correctly for four days and simultaneously the problem restarted.  I certainly don't want to reinstall Windows just to see if that helps.
</p><p>Any advice will be greatly be appreciated.

At first Firefox stops responding, then the mouse cursor freezes. My only recourse is to reboot the computer by pushing the hardware ""reset"" button on the front panel.

</p><p>Also - On Support forum I found a helpful thread for addressing the 'retrieve log in' solution, however, the instruction to 'add my problem' by replying therein required that I 'log in to my account..' (sigh)..
</p><p>So now I've started this new thread (which required creating a Support log in) for which the same email address as was used to 'send info to retrieve account log in' worked fine but the 'retrieve the account' actions continue to fail to deliver (as noted in ""Questions:"" content above)..(sigh #2).
</p><p>FWIW - Added an image from the 'Support Thread' strictly for purposes of highlighting the impediment to 'Reply' to an 'I can't get my account info' thread by, well, being asked to log in to my account else spawn new support thread.
</p><p>Reminder: the real root problem that spawned this thread was my need to solve for ""getting rid of the 'Yahoo!' search returns"". Like a zombie, Yahoo! searches keep popping up irrespective of the 'usual Firefox config./settings that used to eliminate such things, this issue keeps returning to haunt me + my machine.

1247122,2019-01-18 10:37:31 UTC,2019-01-19T08:12:56Z,"Mac Spotlight search wrongly uses Google, I've chosen DuckDuckGo","<p>I've chosen DuckDuckGo as my default engine in FF. If I begin a new search in FF, my search correctly uses DDG. But, if I use macOS's Spotlight to initiate a search, it correctly opens my default browser, FF, then searches with Google. Here are some background details. 
</p><p>1. Open Spotlight and type a search term (e.g. 'KITTENS')
2. Force *web* (rather than local search) in Spotlight field: command+B
3. Default browser (Firefox) correctly opens. 
4. Firefox correctly places search expression in Firefox's search field; e.g.
<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kittens&amp;t=ffnt&amp;atb=v113-2&amp;ia=web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kittens&amp;t=ffnt&amp;atb=v113-2&amp;ia=web</a>
5. About a second later, the DDG search term is replaced by a Google search; e.g.
<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?rls=en_GB&amp;q=kittens&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?rls=en_GB&amp;q=kittens&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8</a>
</p><p>Notes: 
1. This happens on the three macs that I use. 
2. It does not happen if I have Safari as my default browser (Spotlight correctly opens a DDG search on Safari). 
3. I don't have Google even listed as a possible browser in Firefox. 
4. I looked in some Firefox forums and couldn't find any similar comments.
5. I've spent time browsing for others with the same problem but haven't seen anything coming up. Maybe just me or maybe I'm unusual in browsing from Spotlight. 
6. I do not have Google as a non-default browser in FF (i.e., it's nothing obviously like it's tripping up on DDG and picking Google as my next choice - Google's not on the list). 
7. The Troubleshooting Information field below mentions '    ""keyGoogleFound"": true,' Does this mean that Google is somehow 'baked in' to FF and this is the source of the problem?

Now, I can't read enough of the title to know what they are. I can see an icon then about 3 letters. This is extremely frustrating! If I can't get a solution to this I will probably have to switch to another browser that will allow this, leaving FF behind for good . I have too much work that depends on my ability to switch to various tabs, so I really hope I can get some help here. 
</p><p>Another related issue I am having with FF 64 is the inability to reopen the most recently closed tab by right clicking the tab bar, selecting reopen closed tab. I know I can go to History &gt; recently closed tabs, but this makes it more time consuming. I can not for the life of me understand why this changed was made. Maybe something in my profile preferences was corrupted somehow? I just want to be able to quickly reopen my last closed tab like before without having to go to the freakin' menu or use an add-on.
Thanks in advance for your help!

</p><pre>Hice la consulta a soporte de ONLYOFFICE y me contestaron que Firefox no permite imprimir. Me sugirieron hacer la prueba con otro navegador, utilicé el navegador Chrome y el documento se imprime sin problemas alguno.
¿Como puedo solucionar esta situación? ¿Como logro imprimir los documentos editados desde ONLYOFFICE?

Gracias por la atención.

I would like to either know how I can prevent the browser from doing that or get Firefox to stop this from happening over and over by updating the application. I have to manually remove the default browser and select my chosen one after each update. It's getting a little bit ridiculous.

<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1204253"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1204253</a>

</p><p><br>
Based on this advice I went to ""sessionstore-backups"" in \Users\your-user-name\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\
and backed up the files I found there. I even used ShadowExplorer to find some earlier copies of said files and copied those as well.
</p><p>So -with Firefox closed- I copied an older recovery.jsonlz4 and replaced the new one with it.
</p><p>Sadly, when I then open Firefox, the same thing happens. Recovery page with no option to recover, 0 tabs present.
</p><p><br>
Am I doing something wrong?
</p><p><br>
</p><p>P.S. I should add that I simply DO NOT HAVE a restore session option in my drop-down menu. See attached images.
</p><p>P.P.S. No longer having the option to get the ""ask to save and quit"" notification when exiting the browser is a travesty. That option should be brought back ASAP. Both for the extra warning before quitting, and to give you the ability to choose whether or not to discard certain tabs.

1247036,2019-01-17 12:51:43 UTC,2019-01-22T22:42:03Z,Why does FireFox think I'm in Canada?,"<p>So I recently got a new laptop (a Thinkpad P72) at work and so I installed the latest version of FireFox on it (this PC also has MS Edge, IE and Chrome installed on it). After using it for a bit I started to notice that every site I went to was displaying the Canadian version of that site for me despite living in the US and I'm dumbfounded as to why. Even the IT department at my job has no idea what's causing this as there isn't any kind of VPN or anything of that nature at play here. Part of what makes this so confusing is that FireFox is the only thing on my PC that seems to think I'm in Canada (specifically Toronto, Canada). Chrome, IE, Edge and literally everything else on this PC recognizes that I'm in the US. 
</p><p>For what I do at my job this is something of a non-issue but I like to browse the web on my lunch break and so this issue is endlessly frustrating in that regard especially since I vastly prefer FireFox over all other web browsers. I don't have this problem on my PC at home despite being logged into the same FireFox Account. I've done a quick Google search and it appears that this issue isn't entirely uncommon but I'm yet to find a solution that works for me so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Now I have duplicates, and deleting them presents equally probably-a-bug problems. Even if I figure out which duplicate is the ""old"" bookmark under the tag (such as by renaming them and checking which one was added to the target folder), deleting it deletes both. The best workaround I've been able to figure out is to temporarily change the target URL of the one I'm about to delete, since, as I correctly deduced (thanks @mybrain), it's deleting based on the target. Is there any better workaround, or should I report this as a bug (as I was going to do anyway) and hope for a fix? Also, where would the best place to make that report be?

</p><p>In trying to figure out what was going on i took a look for any locks on the target folder with a program called LockHunter. Besides Excel having a lock on the folder, it showed five instances of FireFox locking the folder. The folder has absolutely nothing to do with FireFox, it is a folder with confidential data on a specific business. Once i released each of the FireFox locks on that particular folder the line of code ran without a problem.
</p><p>In trying to recall any possible interaction between FireFox and the particular folder, i recall that i had printed a screenshot from FireShot in FireFox to that folder.  Certain credit reports were also printed to that folder that were accessed through FireFox. I will try each previous interaction and attempt to define if one of those actions creates the locks. Aside from this, any and all thoughts are welcome; i seem to be naturally paranoid, but when dealing with confidential information, even more so...
</p><p>If these locks are the result of poor coding on the part of Mozilla, FireShot or the credit agency i use, can anyone with coding expertise suggest a VBA means to specifically release any and all locks on a folder imposed by FireFox?

It was not working today while submitting the ""Refund"" request on eBay. When I have pressed the ""Refund"" request button nothing has happened. I have used a Google Chrome to complete this task. It is also not fully functioning on Government websites in where (from my opinion) java script is used. It would be great if you can help to resolve this important issue. Thank you.

Also it shows the address was breached on Technic which seems to be a Minecraft site but I went on a couple of different Minecraft sites and now can't log into any of them ( so far ).
Haven't used them for ages yet there was a breach in Nov 2018.  I need to be able to get into the site to delete info ( was for granddaughter ).
Thank you ,   Susan

</li></ol>
<p>I am unable to enable multiprocessing. I tried enabling it by setting `browser.tabs.remote.autostart` to `true` in `about:config`. However whenever I quit and re-open the browser, that setting has been changed back to `false`. How can I get it to stay `true`?
</p>
<ol><li> Details:
</li></ol>
<ul><li> Firefox 64.0.2, 64 bit, Windows 7. 
</li><li> This computer is managed by my employer. However I installed Firefox myself, straight from <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>.
</li><li> `about:support` says `Multiprocess Windows 	0/1 (Disabled)`. (Note that if an add-on is causing multiprocessing to be disabled, it will say ""Disabled by Add-on"", which is not what I'm seeing.)
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ol><li> What I've tried:
</li></ol>
<ul><li> I have disabled my addons. 
</li><li> I have looked for prefs.js and mozilla.cfg in the locations listed here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1237547"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1237547</a> The only one which exists is `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref\pref.js`. I do not have sufficient permissions to modify or delete that. The contents seem unrelated:

<p>//pref(""app.update.channel"", ""release"");
```
</p>
<ul><li> I went to `about:support`, clicked on ""Profile Folder: Open Folder"", (C:\Users\$USERNAME\ApPData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\$HEX.default`) searched for prefs.js in that folder. I quit firefox, changed the `browser.tabs.remote.autostart` setting there to true, saved, and started firefox again. The setting in `about:config` was false, and `about:support` shows multiprocessing is disabled.
</li></ul>
<p>Impact: 
I am not able to use the ""responsive design"" functionality. Also, the browser is quite slow. (I don't even have many tabs open, always &lt; 15)

Running Windows 7, 32bit. I always run the most current version of Nightly. Last week sometime it started behaving strangely after updates. If an update has been downloaded and I close and restart Nightly, no application window will open. If I open Task Manager and look at the processes, there will be somewhere between 4 and 30 instances of firefox.exe running. They will cyclically open and close but there always at least 4 processes going which I think is baseline for e10 Nightly behavior. If I try to terminate the processes, I receive an error saying the process cannot be terminated. The only way out is to reboot the computer. Of course when I try to reboot, I get a message from Windows saying a background program is running that must be closed before I can restart (I think it is the typical Task Host process). In any case, when I reboot and open Nightly again, it starts up normally and has been updated. Since there are daily updates, this has been occurring daily and it is starting to get on my nerves!  Strangely, no crash report is generated for this (if I go to about:crashes there are no new instances...). I did a refresh of Nightly and booted with all add-ons disabled which did not help.

i can change the general cache location, but this doesn't satisfy my needs.

reason for requiring this is quite simple and probably often used.
</p><p>I work in a company where the windows 10 user profiles in our active directory
are transferred back and forth with each login/logout.

within the windows user profile.
</p><p>But the simple speed enhancing webcontent storage is actually ruining the
experience of users having to wait uselessly for these kind of cached data.
</p><p>For this part of the cache it would be totally sufficient to store it somewhere
else outside the backuped user profiles.

As a matter of fact I use Firefox exclusively because the quality was better than on Google or Edge.  I haven't watched any videos for about a week, busy with other things and decided last night, with the snow, was a good night to watch a video.  I clicked the Watch Button as I have for months and the icon went around and around and around.  The video never started.  I tried 3 more and none of them would play.  I called Amazon they had me clear the cache and cookies, and it started to play, I stopped it and said it looked like it was fixed and hung up.  Went back to play and the icon went around and around etc.   The videos play fine in Google and in Edge no problem with either of those browsers but still not playing in Firefox.  I checked and see that Firefox Updated since the last time I watched videos on it.  I read some articles that suggested I remove Firefox from my allowed programs through the firewall, then re add it.  Did not, no improvement, the videos still will not play.  I wasn't sure if their videos were Flash or HTML 5 so updated Flash... nothing they still won't play.

</p><p>my Firefox setup on a linux installation becomes nearly unusable during downloads or playback of videos. The system load is constantly at 25-30% and firefox does not react at all or with a lot of lag (more than 10 seconds to select a different tab). In addition to that, the downloads are slow and also opening the downloads windows is slow. Safe mode does not fix the issue, disabling addons does not fix it, a clean profile also does not fix it. What else can I try?
</p><p>System:
OS: Manjaro Linux (Current version), Kernel 4.20.
Hardware: Notebook with Intel i5-3320M (4) @ 3.300GHz, 16 GB of RAM, SSD Drive
RAM use is somewhere around 3-4 GB, depending on the number of open tabs. SWAP is available but not used.

</p><p>When Firefox has had trouble loading, it sometimes displays an innocuous looking dialogue box asking whether you'd like to run in safe mode or ""refresh Firefox"". What it is actually asking is if you would like to wipe Firefox, erase your profile, return to factory settings. I previously made the infuriating mistake of choosing refresh because that term is understood to mean 'reload' e.g. refresh a web page, like switching something off then on again—not erasing something and replacing it with a blank empty slate.
</p><p>As this happened a while back and I'm not risking it again by clicking the option, I don't recall what the full description was but it certainly did not make clear what ""refreshing"" entailed and to have it presented as a solution for something so minor and nonproblematic as loading slower than usual only ensures more and more users will fall victim to this. Considering the browser defaults to warning the user when they're closing tabs, it's absurd that such a nuclear option is suggested so flippantly and without transparency.

Hace unas semanas tuve problemas internos con mi servidor y tuve que reinstalarlo todo. Ahora mismo solo tengo instalado un FTP como almacenamiento en la nube y Webmin para administrarlo de forma remota. Siempre he accedido a Webmin con HTTPS desde el puerto 10000 por lo que al principio Firefox siempre me avisa que no es seguro por ser un certificado autofirmado. Obviamente al ser mío agrego la excepción y accedo a Webmin. Pero esta vez no me aparece la opción de agregar excepción si accedo desde el dominio DDNS que tengo pero sí si accedo desde la IP pública o la IP privada. La IP pública al ser dinámica no puedo acceder desde ahí siempre, por eso uso de un DDNS si necesito acceder desde fuera. He intentado descargar el certificado y agregarlo y no me deja. ¿hay algo que pueda hacer al respecto para acceder? No soy el único que accede desde el dominio por lo que cambiarlo no es una opción viable a primera vista.

A week ago I noticed some problems with one website I was using and so thought that maybe it's because I was using outdated browser or something like that. To check this out I updated Firefox to newest (in that moment) version of it, but it wasn't the case, and because I didn't like the changes made to interface and other things I immediately downgraded it back to the version I was using earlier. But then I realized that all my browser history was gone.
</p><p>I spent last week trying to undo or repair it, and so I found out that my browser history was still there, untouched, but for some reason older Firefox could not ""see"" it. After updating again to the newest version browser history was back and it showed again.
</p><p>I tried many things, like System Restore or Firefox Sync, to somehow get the history back in the older version, but it just didn't work.
</p><p>The thing is, while the history doesn't appear in version 47.0b9, the last session - tabs that I had opened - still showed, and when clicking on ""History"" button, before going into History window, there was a list of recently visited websites, and the last sites I visited before that whole situation were truly there, so I presume it has to have access to files that contain my browser history.
</p><p>I am aware that there are supposedly some safety risks that come with using older version of Firefox, but I didn't experience any problems during my long usage of it so I don't see an issue.
</p><p>I really need my browser history to work again in older version of Firefox, and not only because I don't like how newest version looks, but because of how search bar was changed (that is most crucial to me when it comes to this topic) and the fact that after upgrading the browser it started to work slower than before for some reason, which is quite jarring. Some other applications also started working slower, but it isn't as important as the browser.
</p><p>I also tried slightly newer version of Firefox, but it seems that anything below 55 doesn't work. I think I've read somewhere that in version 55 any downgrade below started to not be supported anymore.
</p><p>I'm sure there were some changes made to files that contain browser history and things related to it over the course of time. I think that ""places.sqlite"" file was actually five times bigger after updating to newest version, but I don't know why is that, I'm not really knowledgeable in that field.
</p><p>But I wonder if there is anything I can do to make it work again in older version, specifically 47.0b9.

1246512,2019-01-12 03:37:28 UTC,2019-01-15T15:51:39Z,How to stop Firefox from redirecting me to https on my internal webserver,"<p>So, this is different than all the other redirecting issues that I've read about so far.
</p><p>The scenario:
</p><p>I am an admin who has an internal, LAN-only webserver.  It is serving up half a dozen web servers running on various ports for various reasons.  E.g., Ticketing system on port 8080, an Apache-based Wiki on port 80, Nginx-based GitLab on 443 (the only https site!), etc. etc.
</p><p>If I open the wiki and browse around, everything works great.  If I open a new tab and go to Gitlab on 443, everything works great.  However, as soon as I go back to the wiki and click a link (or just hit refresh), it takes me to the Gitlab error page, because it stuck an 's' on the http://webserver/wiki.php URL, and now Gitlab is trying to serve up an invalid URL at https://webserver/wiki.php.
</p><p>Even though Gitlab is an internal webserver with a self-signed cert, the CA cert has been imported into Firefox so I get the green lock icon.
</p><p>Troubleshooting / What doesn't work:
</p><p>- The intranet page doesn't end in .dev or .foo, so it's not trying to load Google's website at that TLD.
- Changing any settings in about:config doesn't help (at least none of the settings that can be found in the first few pages of a Google search).
- Deleting my entire Firefox profile doesn't change anything
- Running in Private Browsing / Purple screen doesn't change anything (when loading both websites in the same ""mode"" - see below).
- I have checked the wiki webserver for any extraneous .htaccess files with URL redirects.
- I have checked the wiki httpd.conf file(s) for any https redirects
- There are no addons installed
- Currently running version 60.2.2 ESR.  I will try to upgrade to 60.4.0 ESR ASAP. This behavior does NOT happen with 52.x ESR.
</p><p>What DOES work, albeit temporarily:
</p><p>If I go into Preferences -&gt; Clear History -&gt; select the 'Site Preferences' setting, then the wiki will load and I can click around.  However, the moment I go back to Gitlab and click on a link or refresh, the next URL I click on in the wiki will attempt to load a https version, Gitlab's webservice at port 443 takes over, and I get a 404.  Go back to Preferences and delete the site preferences, and the cycle repeats.
</p><p>This behavior also exists in Private Browsing mode with both sites either in two tabs or separate Private Browsing windows.
</p><p>What works ""permanently"":
</p><p>If I open the wiki in Regular Browsing mode and Gitlab in Private Browsing mode (or vice versa), I can access each website simultaneously in their respective windows.  No https redirect occurs.
</p><p>My conclusion:
</p><p>As soon as I go to Gitlab, some Site Preferences setting gets saved that insists on redirecting all URLs at that domain to https.  This site setting gets re-added at every web page invocation/reload, as demonstrated by deleting the Site Preferences and watching the behavior start up again on a refresh.  
</p><p>Site Preferences are shared among tabs in both Regular Browsing and Private Browsing, but they aren't shared BETWEEN Regular and Private browsing.  This is immaterial to the issue at hand, just an interesting observation.
</p><p>This problem started between versions 52 and 60.
</p><p>I don't know how site preferences are saved. This could be a GitLab problem (generating these site preferences), but then why does v52 work fine...

I want to have the Brother printer come up as the default printer, but can't find anyway to do it.  I have checked the support pages and searched, but found nothing that seemed to apply.
I'm still using Firefox 55.0.3 as the later versions don't support the ""open tabs from last time"" add-on and that is a great time-saver and organizer for me.  I am using Windows 7.

I have some older cisco CDs, where, except for the 1st home.htm, ALL the .htm files on it are zipped.  Cisco started doing this, to save space back when a HDD was less than 1GB, back about 1997. After this, all the Documentation CDs had to be run/viewed thru the AUTOPLAY.exe 1st, then 'Launch CD' (which ran LAUNCHIT.EXE I think) which put an unzipper in memory so that whatever browser you chose (on the next screen) woudl have every .htm file unzipped b4 it was passed on to the Browser.

</p><p>Seems simple enough...
- find all .htm files below a certain Directory, and unzip them, using the same name, appending a unique number or letter (like -old) to the filename as the new unzipped file has to have the same name as the original.

</p><p>My company uses an EDR (endpoint detection and response) solution in its security stack. We've noticed a difference between how Firefox handles files downloaded from the internet when compared with Chrome, IE, and Safari. 
</p><p>One of the things EDR solutions record is when files are written to disk. If you download a file from the web -- we'll call it foo.rtf -- using Chrome, IE, or Safari on Windows you see a temp file being written to the TEMP directory while the file is being downloaded then you see the Chrome, IE, or Safari process write the actual file (foo.rtf) to the Downloads folder (or wherever you told your browser to put it). 
</p><p>When observing Firefox, we see the tmp file being written to the TEMP directory but then never see Firefox actually write the file foo.rtf to the downloaded location. 
</p><p>I guess my question is: does Firefox download the complete file as foo.tmp; move foo.tmp to the desired download location; then rename it? 
</p><p>Any guidance is appreciated.

</p><p>It is nothing to do with other programs on my PC.  Have uninstalled programs started my PC in Safe mode etc numerous times.  Disabled programs etc.
</p><p>Enable hardware acceleration disabled that to no avail.
</p><p>I've unistalled Flash because i know that can cause problems with websites like You tube who use there own version of flash but that makes no difference.  So I have it installed again for websites that still can't run without Adobe Falsh installed.
</p><p>The wheel just spins as it won't stream videos, music etc.  Sometimes it will start playing for a few seconds then the download stream gets blocked and the spinning starts.
</p><p>This might be helpful though it has not done this for a few months.  You Tube it would white out the video images in the side bar as something blocked the download for the images.  It used to do the same on the music website Discogs but that has not happened recently.
</p><p>I had this problem when I had Windows 10  and that was 64 bit as well.  It is now just becoming a pain.  Firefox is the best browser by far bar this problem.  I have numerous other browsers installed and there is no problems like this with them so Firefox is the problem with flash.
</p><p>No point adding screenshots as you will know what is happening.  Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

</p><p>A few months ago this happen too and what I did was to uninstall webadviser using window uninstall and go into my programs files and manually delete all remaining webadviser mcafee files, this seem to resolved this problem.  
</p><p>But last few days it happen again, of course, I tried completed uninstall but this time the problem remains. Webadvisor works fine until I shutdown.  This is happening on both of my computers.  
</p><p>I think this is related to the latest Firefox or webadvisor updates.  I think either one or both of them update within the last few days.  I am running the current version of Firefox and version 4.0.7.213 Webadvisor which should be the latest versions.  
</p><p>I think what is happening is that Firefox is uninstalling webadvisor  everything there is a shutdown/restart (perhaps a virus protection feature?)  Is there a way to disable this only for web advisor?  Of course if there is a standard solution or better solution please let me know.

I've tried safe mode but it didn't make any difference. Only solution was returning back to 63.0.3 where everything works fine.
Today I've tried updating to 64.0.2 hoping that problem was fixed, but it still remains. 
Even went to try latest 65 beta, but same thing every tab that gets in focus and reloads, tab crashed immediately and cannot be restored.
I don't have many add-ons, but one thing I've noticed is if I try to go to Panorama Tab Groups it crashes entire Firefox.
However disabling that add-on didn't help with tab crashes.
This is all happening on Windows 7 64-bit, while on my other computer with Windows 10 64-bit everything works fine on version 64.0 and 64.0.2 with same add-ons installed.
Here is a list off add-ons used on both computers:
</p><pre>+ Close Tab Button
+ Dark Reader
+ Livemarks
+ Nuke Anything
+ Panorama Tab Groups
+ uBlock Origin
+ Web Developer
+ Zoom Image

Various reasons for this, not least being vision problems.","<p>This is not an issue of being inflexible to change.  Some people are unable to function without text for identification.  Icons need to have three options.  Text.  Text under icon.  Icon.  This was previously available, and MUST be returned to the interface.  Likewise, the ability to use pages, not tabs, and to have the tab disappear when it is a single tab, is a function that is necessary.  The narrow screens that now exist lack vertical real estate, and anything that wastes that space is a fault, not a perk.  Until Firefox fixes these issues, I have ceased using it, and now use other, more adaptable, browsers.

</p><p>I got a new computer recently.  In figuring out how to transfer my bookmarks (which many are saved in various folders on the bookmark toolbar menu), I signed up for a Mozilla account in thinking that I could sync them over the cloud.  Today I signed into that Mozilla account on my old computer.  As soon as I did, my bookmark toolbar menu started changing folders, removing them.  About 5 seconds later, I am left with only those that are currently on my new computer; they seemed to sync themselves.

<p>I wonder is something's changed in a new Fx version or 2 (since 11/04/18) that broke cor-el's code?
I tried it in regular Fx 64 &amp; in Tor Browser that uses Fx 60.4esr.  The  ""dark-theme"" colors are the same in both those Fx versions (washed out).
I tried putting it above the @namespace line, as mentioned, and below it - neither worked.
</p><p>I see in developer tools dark-theme.css file, the selector is "".theme-body"", not ""body"":
</p><p>.theme-body {
</p><pre> background: var(--theme-body-background);
 color: var(--theme-body-color); 
</pre>
<p>(that's from dark-theme.css, not what I put in userChrome.css.
</p><p>Also, I'm not clear on the path to use here: @-moz-document url-prefix(chrome://devtools/content/) {,
as I've never styled any chrome elements.
I saw one honking big devtools  theme somewhere.  I think they just used ""(chrome://devtools/content/)"" - (no quotes) for the 1st line.  Changing the 1st line to that didn't work either.
</p><p>Are we sure about the path to enter, //chrome/devtools/content/?
I guess it depends on whether it needs to reference the folder (in omni.ja) that holds the sub-folders for all the tools (Inspector, Debugger, etc.) - which is /chrome/devtools/content/ (in Tor Browser / Fx 60.4esr).
</p><p>If the path shown in the 1st line needs to be the folder that holds all the css &amp; the dark-theme.css files, then it's ""/chrome/devtools/skin/.""  I only tried the /chrome/devtools/content.
Thanks.

I tried to clear the cache, use a new profile or refresh an already used one.

Sadly, IE or even Chrome now match that description better than Firefox 63+.  
</p><p>(Feel free to break these into separately-trackable issues, if you like)
</p><p>1. Please purge ALL non-essential animations currently built into the product (as opposed to a website, obviously.)  All animations  *on the Firefox-generated tabs* are extraneous, CPU-robbing and distracting.  End-users expect a reliable, consistent, non-distracting product.

The page never changes and nothing happens (no error, no loading icon, no other messages). Even from a private window it doesn't load up.

</p><p>You can delete the chromeappsstore.sqlite file in the Firefox Profile Folder to remove all blocked sites from the new tab page. This will probably break the about:home page and you will have to reset the browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone pref on the about:config page and close and restart Firefox to initialize the local storage in the chromeappsstore.sqlite database that is used for the about:home page.

I have a desktop with over 1,000 saved logins.  The other day, I was on my laptop and synced both devices so i had the same info on each device.  Then I took about 3 hours on my laptop, deleting hundreds of old/obsolete logins and passwords.  So.....
</p><p>Now I want to update my desktop with the new cleaned up saved logins from my laptop.  But I am confused.  I am thinking I should open my desktop and SYNC Firefox from there, and it will update all current desktop logins with my new cleaned up login list version from my laptop.  Or doesn't it matter, when I hit SYNC, the most recent changes will update the old changes from any device??
</p><p>I know this is probably so simple - but I am afraid to hit SYNC for fear I am doing it incorrectly . . . like plugging the wrong jumper cable to the wrong battery connection . . . I sure appreciate  someone explaining the proper way to do this.  I would hate to lose 3 hours of work.

The icon on top was created with Firefox by dragging from the browser URL to the Desktop, and the same on the bottom was made with IE, or Chrome, is normal and good, and it would be so nice to have Firefox be able to do the same thing please, and thank you!
</p><p>edit: ..now of course I want the created icon to retain the icon logo of the website it's from, which has always been the normal way of things, imho anyway. (I randomly used Google as the site I was on, to create its shortcut)
</p><p>edit 2 the next day: ..I've now installed Firefox on my Windows 10 box, and I can't believe it's the exact same thing with this small website icon image with a bigger white square around it. It's the same issue whether you have the shortcut on the desktop or in a folder.
I've did some more research about this, and see it asked over and over again for the last 7 years, and I just can't believe that no one has created an extension, or whatever, to fix this arightly, for the people who like that when you drag an internet shortcut from the website you are visiting, that you want to keep each websites icon on the shortcut which the new firefox does that, but, also have it show Normal Size as shown in the bottom of my screenshot as IE and Chrome does it.

</p><p>Suddenly, I can no longer log into my bank account's website from Firefox.  I get the website but it does not let me log in.  Password and ID are unchanged and they are not saved in Firefox. I have to put them in each time.  I have called the bank and they say the problem is Firefox. They asked me to use Google chrome instead as a browser and that works-- ie I call up the bank website, put in the id and password and get into my account in the normal way.
Thus, bottom line, Google Chrome works for me to get to my bank but Firefox does not.  Why?  Can this be fixed?
I am concerned that if suddenly Firefox cannot get me my bank, what am I going to lose next?
</p><p>I have tried, unsuccessfully to email Firefox directly on this. If anyone knows how to fix this or at least how to get my question to Firefox, I would be most appreciative.

</p><p>Firefox will start and run normally for perhaps half an hour. Then it suddenly goes into a ""reload loop"" - the little ""Reload Current Page"" circular arrow goes around and around as if I had asked for reloads, even if no page load or  reload has been requested. Firefox does not respond to keyboard or mouse inputs. I have to invoke the Task Manager to shut down Firefox. I then Restart the computer, and everything is fine until next time.
</p><p>If Thunderbird is running, it develops the ""Thunderbird is processing the account - please wait"" error at the same time that Firefox begins its error. However, Firefox has the same problem even if Thunderbird is not running. 
</p><p>Because the problem seems to affect two programs, I first assumed that the OS was corrupted. I did a complete ""upgrade from Win 7 to Win 7"" using the reinstall disk that came with the computer. No help. I allowed Win 7 to do the massive number of Updates to bring Win 7 up to the current version. They completed successfully - and the problem is still with me. Then, because both programs are from Mozilla, I uninstalled and re-installed both programs again. The error continues.
</p><p>No other application programs appear to be part of this problem. Is it likely that something in my Mozilla Profile folder is causing this?

1245900,2019-01-06 15:58:59 UTC,2019-01-06T15:58:59Z,YouTube sound in Firefox is very low,"<p>For several weeks, I played YouTube from Firefox and the sound was very low. I thought there's something wrong with my speaker, but I noticed when I played in Opera, it sounded good. When I first opened YouTube, they sounded good, but after I repeated the same video, the sound became so low, or when I paused the video then replayed it, it also happened. Sometimes, it already sounded low. 
What I've done are refreshing Firefox, reinstall Firefox, start Firefox in safe mode, clear cache, and so many things but none of them worked. I'm certain that it was not from the volume slider as I read from some references. My Firefox version is 64.0 with Windows 10 Home.
I remembered that back then, the YouTube just played nicely like always been. I don't know since when did the Firefox become like this. 
Any information regards would be appreciated. Thank you!

Firefox. Hit Windows-Symbol plus R to open command window, entered firefox.exe -p and got following Message:

The Firefox itself is working correctly and the profile of the old Firefox has been correctly imported.

With Waterfox I use the Tabs on Bottom add-on and that's it.
You may believe my need is frivolous, but for me that makes the difference between keeping or uninstalling Firefox.
Bottom line: is still forbiddend to wish to get the tab bar where I believe it should be?

Just because people continue making new guitars does not mean old ones have no value.  In fact, they often SOUND much better, &amp; the same sort of thing applies to software.  Older versions of Firefox (for XP) are INFINITELY better than the new versions, so I want the add ons and support details for those.  It's easy enough to note the compatibility of different add ons in the pages on your site, and what is also silly is having to install things like old now missing from your site also) 'nightly tester tools' to make your old stuff work on 'ESR' releases.  Part of the reason 'Chrome is taking over' is because your 'support' model is crazy.  You can simply say something like 'we do not provide any customer service answers for XP'.  That's fine, but LEAVE ALL THE ADD ONS AND THE PAGES UP! =)  I will never switch my rental fleet of Dells away from XP, because it is infinitely superior to the stuff that came after.  It's running almost all the ATMs &amp; banks &amp; power plants &amp; shipping &amp; so many other things.  NEWER DOES NOT MEAN BETTER =)  Contact me and I will also be happy to provide FREE 'customer support' for the many other people out there using XP versions of Firefox, or who would like to, but are unaware how much more AWESOME it is after tweaking it out with OLD 'obsolete' add ons ~;-)

Computer use is not all about Internet browsing...and it's not even smart enough to know when the additional memory is not required.   Very disappointing.
</p><p>I have been fighting this for a few months and despite being a loyal Firefox user over the years, I'm seriously considering transition to another browser like Chrome which provides good performance but not at the expense of all other user applications and system operations.  This apparent controlling mentality of Firefox at the expense of everything else is so counter to the general Mozilla intent of supporting a better user experience.  If there are legitimate options for reducing memory usage even at the expense of Firefox performance, I would appreciate suggestions.

After 2-3 days gone by, I get an orange triangle on the top right hand side of Firefox, I click on the menu, then options I am asked to sign in to sync which I do, then after 2-3 days I have the orange triangle back again.
I have had this for quite a while now, but never reported it as I just kept signing in, But it's started to become very annoying to me now, especially when I have to keep verifying via email to confirm my account,  why can't I just stay signed in, and why do I keep getting disconnected from firefox sync.?
Hope someone can fix this for me?
Kind regards

</p><p>In HTML you can jump to an item (usually heading) by id (<a href=""http://domain.name"" rel=""nofollow"">domain.name</a>#heading).
Today we tried utilizing this feature in our office to create a short link which allows you to immediatly access a searchbar on our CRM Webapp.
In our office we all use Chrome, but my browser of choice is Firefox. Now I'm kind of disappointed Firefox seems like it doesn't support this feature.
</p><p>To demonstrate what I mean:
Lets say this is my Website: <a href=""https://www.archlinux.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.archlinux.org</a>#pkgsearch-field
</p><p>When I open this link in Chrome I'm able to immediately search for a package but when I open it in Firefox, nothing happens. Also, as soon as I reload my page in Chrome it won't work, but I can open it in a new tab and it works again.
</p><p><br>
Do you have any idea why this happens? Is it an extra feature Firefox doesn't support? Can I get it to work in Firefox (I really hope so)? I'm looking forward to hear from you.
</p><p>Kind regards
yours Philipp

Next day, after he left and I opened my laptop, I saw in History, that he was stealing confidential information (specific photos from a product of my company), from a facebook messenger chat of mine, with a developer.
I saw in the history, that he was searching for ""pictures"" in the conversation. 
I am trying to get some information from the history tab, in order to find out how much time was he spending on that specific page, so I can find out what exactly was he able to do.
I was clicking on that URL in the history, but i saw, that the firefox history wasn t keeping the 1st acces to that, only the last one. So if I am trying to search for the URL on the 2nd of January, 2019 (when the ""crime"" happened), I can t find it there, I can find only a date which shows me a newer date (the date when I saw it and accesed the URL to see what is it).
I need your help guys. It is very important for me. (please don t judge me why i was discussing such a thing on facebook or why was I letting him to my laptop...I was just tring to be human, because I knew him from several years).
Any help is welcome. PLEASE HELP! I NEED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH TIME HE SPENT ON  THE URL!

I will include a screenshot with the details. I am on Windows 10 October Update.
I appear to have 2 versions of firefox on my laptop as you will see in the screenshot, they are both x64, one is version 57 and the other is version 64. Can i remove the older version (57) without it affecting the other version i have installed (64) ?

The ""most popular"" section down the right edge is present.
If you open the page in IE or Edge, the video shows (may take a couple of extra seconds to show after the page is shown, but it does appear).
</p><p>If I disable *all* addons and restart firefox it still does not show.  But if I start Firefox in safe mode, the video shows.  Hence I suspect there is a setting in my firefox options or ""about:config"" that is  causing it.  However, I have been unable to figure out what might be that causing this and how to 'fix"" it.
</p><p>Does someone know what option/s or setting/s will be causing the videos to not show unless I start firefox in safe mode?

annually the company which I work for uses a third party portal to sell old hardware to employs. The problem is that every time the auctions are launched the server suffers from a very heavy load. To put an item in your basket you have to reload the page, which at that point in time takes even up to couple of minutes (thus someone may be faster then me, and win the auction).
</p><p>My first question is if there are any settings in the about:config section which I can adjust to decrease the page reload time, assuming that the server response time will be very slow.
</p><p>Second issue I noticed on that page, even when it is not heavily loaded is that the Performance analysis of that site indicates in the ""Primed cache"" that:
Cached responses: 0
Total requests: 33
Size: 462.41 KB
Transferred Size: 1,799.78 KB
Time: 0.66 seconds
Non blocking time: 0.66 seconds
On the other hand the Network monitor table indicates that almost all items were ""cached"" (in the ""Transferred"" column).
</p><p>So my second question is why Performance analysis indicates that cached responses are zero, while the actual log from network monitor table shows different result.

I no longer test Windows 10, as it is the last consumer (home, pro, and enterprise editions) that Microsoft is going to put out.  According to them, all features, fixes, improvements, and changes will be made through Windows Update to Windows 10.  I am testing Server 2019 but not with Firefox(never run a beta on a beta OS).  I also have been testing iOS for Apple for over a year(iPad based).  I learned through <a href=""http://privateinternetaccess.com"" rel=""nofollow"">privateinternetaccess.com</a>(I have not subscribed yet, but providing a particular test is successful, I plan to) that Firefox Nightly supported ESNI which cloudflare DNS Servers support.  Can anyone give me a link to opt-in to the appropriate study?

Chrome &amp; Safari wrap the font properly. It's a unicode problem and has to do with including the proper unicode for the Tibetan syllable division symbol in the library of word break parameters.  Go to any website in Tibetan on the Firefox browser and you will see sentences running off the page or creating horizontally scrolling pages.  The same website will display fine on Chrome and Safari.   If anyone knows of a workaround, let me know.  I've tried all the usual suspects.  Tibetan uses [U+0F0B TIBETAN MARK INTERSYLLABIC TSHEG] (pronounced tsek) to signal the end of a syllable.

Pick one for your search site (I was using <a href=""http://Startpage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Startpage.com</a>).
</p><p>It should be easy.  It was easy - before.  This time it wasn't - but did eventually work (long, long time).
In the screen, you see under Post Parameters.  I was using <a href=""https://startpage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://startpage.com</a> and changing a few options.
They create a URL with those settings, but they're no longer in json format.  That  may be the problem.
</p><p>One result is in ""plain text"", but you'll see it's not json format.  The other URL, the custom settings are obfuscated.  I saw / tested other plugins for startpage from Mycroft that used the obfuscated string in BOTH the Post Parameters &amp; Search Form URL  entry &amp; they seemed to worked fine.  When I created mine &amp; installed (them, about 5 diff times), it wouldn't start up with the color theme selected &amp; saved in the string.  
</p><p>The only way I got that to work was look at some other plugins on Mycroft &amp; after the  ""query={searchTerms}"" , I had to add ""&amp;t=dark"", or else once installed, on the 1st use from the search manager, it opened the site w/ light theme.  After another search, it recognized the dark theme chosen (&amp; saved in the string their settings page created).
</p><p>Needless to say, there isn't any ""&amp;t=dark"" setting in the strings that Startpage NOW creates.  I used it because other plugins used it - even some recent ones w/ the ""new"" Startpage icon (2 blue rectangles w/ white stripe between).  But there are no json strings being created by the site anymore for custom settings.
</p><p>I'm guessing that the open search form / specs like on Mycroft Project need json format data?
Because the custom settings string also had 20 results per page &amp; it only shows the default of 10.  I'd guess the site ignores the settings in the plugin that don't use json?  Maybe some of the older plugins using obfuscated strings were actually json to begin with?  I don't see how the site could read (json) data if it's obfuscated.
</p><p>It appears their site still recognizes the names / values in json format, if you know the correct ones.  I'd have to look in a lot of Startpage  plugins to find the correct json format abbreviations for various settings, if that's the only way an open search plugin will work.   Mozilla is making it hard for people not to use the included search engines - as is - for obvious reasons.

I restored my missing data by copying the contents of the previous profile from my Time Machine backup.

I have a localhost XAMPP installation which is not accessible through the Internet. I use the self-signed certificate supplied with XAMPP to enable SSL development. Let me repeat myself — I am doing my development on my own localhost with no access over the internet for my development server. This is my own machine, completely and entirely owned by me. Every time Firefox does an update, it finds a new way to tell me that it has complete control over the machine that it allows me to use only on its own terms. It does everything it can to ensure that I have no control over it.
</p><p>In light of this, several years ago, I completely uninstalled Firefox, only too happy to consign it to the evil waste heap it so richly deserves. Like a complete idiot I decided to reinstall it about six months ago. Since then, I've spent weeks trying to make it work. Just when I get it somehow to work, it begins to completely bomb again. This last iteration, just one in a long series of iterations, I have spent two complete, entire, and utterly wasted DAYS trying to find a resolution to no avail. That's two days, well over 16 hours, of completely wasted time when I could have been earning money. (When is Firefox going to pay me for what that cost? Where and how do I submit my bill?) It still does not work continuing to give a Your connection is not secure.  Error code: MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT error and no alternatives for a workaround.  It should be noted that, at no point, does Firefox give me the ""Add Exception"" button that it formerly gave. (I guess they had to remove that workaround because it prevented Firefox from having absolute control over my machine.
</p><p>During those two, long, unproductive days, I tried every supposed resolution I could find via Google, including numerous changes to about:config. None of them worked.
</p><p>The machine that my localhost is installed on is a Windos 10 Pro machine running Apache 2.4. I am using Firefox v.63 with the Flash plugin (not used in web development, of course). My anti-malware is Malwarebytes. When Firefox, the greatest malware of all times, decided to take control of my machine and block my web development, I completely turned off Malwarebytes to ensure that it wasn't the primary culprit. (It had never been at the root of the problem in the past. Malwarebytes makes it easy to add exceptions for an IP address such as 127.0.0.1, the IP universally used by localhosts. In any case, turning off Malwarebytes, of course, did nothing with regard to the issue created by Firefox. Naturally, Firefox would never implement such a simple resolution because, after all, they have to have complete control over my machine.)
</p><p>My question is: Is there any way to permanently, totally, completely, and irrevocably prevent Firefox from blockading me from doing web development, allowing me to access with ease, localhost web sites, created in the Apache virtual host (httpd-vhost.conf) configuration file on IP 127.0.0.1 and established in the Windows hosts file (/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts)? Or is the only resolution to completely uninstall/trash Firefox from my system and never look back?

1245402,2019-01-01 12:31:13 UTC,2019-01-04T02:14:29Z,"Feedback: The ""Bookmark"" story is less than ideal.","<p>I got here via <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/feedback/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/feedback/</a> so the following should be treated as “product feedback” rather than a ""question"".
</p><p>Let me first say that I’m quite happy with FF overall but the way it supports ""Bookmarks"" really frustrates me... 
First, I've not been convinced to check how ""Pocket List"" differs from ""Bookmarks"" and the mere presence of its icon in the URL bar next to the “Star icon”  irritates me since each time I want to click ""bookmark"" I always experience this fraction of delay figuring out which button to press.. at the very least I would like to have the option to move the “Star icon” to the other end of the bar. Second, upon times I think to access a previously saved bookmark I instantly get this “ooof” like feeling, suggesting this to be tedious … I suspect this because: 
1) The “tilted books” icon is quite ""distant"" from the “Star icon” by different measures, it's not within the same control group, and it is set apart by a substantial length compared to the distance between icons in a group, so effectively,  the “Bookmark concept"" is in two places and since I save more than I review I tend to first look at the ""star icon"" regardless of what I actually want to do with ""Bookmarks"".  I think a more intuitive design for me would have the ""star"" and ""books"" icons be adjacent visually somehow...  perhaps combining the two into a ""dropdown button"".  2) Once I do locate and click the ""books icon""  I'm  somewhat  overwhelmed by seeing many options which  all deal with ""past pages"" and it takes me another click to open the ""sub-menu"" to show the ""Bookmark list"", which itself is not really consistent with sub-menus as a UI navigation pattern. 3) ..at which point I’m presented with a relatively narrow list of descriptions having the majority of them being cut-off. This makes the whole list appear very cryptic. I would really appreciate having a one-button click experience in order to reveal my bookmarks. As a quick remedy, I would love to have the option to change the semantics of the URL bar pull down pane (e.g drop-down arrow) to show my bookmarks instead of the recently visited URL's (I never ever used this list to navigate back to a site). 
</p><p>Hope this is considered...

I've tried opening Moz Ff as an administrator: it still opens only in Private mode. 
I THINK it's that which is preventing me from viewing &amp; doing the g-----m Google CAPTCHA required to submit a question on a web page. 
I've been able to do CAPTCHA using Moz Ff -my only browser-on other pages in the past. A bLurb says they say they need Java, but why now?
Not only that, the CAPTCHA help page to which a link refers me says the latest 2 v.s of MozFf are supported by their v.2 CAPTCHA, so it should be fine.
--UNLESS-- this particular site hasn't updated their CAPTCHA app. I suppose that's possible.
</p><pre>But just to ensure I've done everything--

<p>HOW THE H--L DO I STOP MOZ FF from being in the ""Private"" mode!!??  Just for the purpose of appeaseing f-----g Google for a moment?
Thanks in advance.

I can do it on other servers but why not Firefox?,"<p>I use Firefox for entering secure websites which always use a two step authentication process. Once my device is recognized I enter the site(s) quickly and safely and because the sites recognize my device I do not have to do the two steps constantly. Two weeks ago Firefox stopped allowing one of my secure websites to recognize my device at step two. Why isn't Firefox allowing a secure website to register my device at step two? Firefox allowed for step one but not the second step.
I still have other secure sites where step two is working fine. This one secure site and perhaps others seem the major issue.  
I checked with the website's company, my computer support system and used another server as well. The server works fine at the two step stage and it is not a website nor computer brand issue. Both I was able to contact and they worked with me. In the end it comes down to being a Firefox problem. 
Something tells me it is either a simple fix or Firefox made changes effecting this process with certain websites. I need help.
I have repeatedly asked Firefox for answers but it is not responding except to explain how to sign in to Firefox and that is not what I am talking about. Finally I was sent here. Can anyone help? I would rather not show the two step page but it is asking to answer additional questions each time I try to enter my account and to click a box to say they will register this device so I can skip stage two in the future. I can then enter my account but once I log out and enter later.. back to doing the entire step two again. My device was not recognized by the website using Firefox. Please help. Thank you
