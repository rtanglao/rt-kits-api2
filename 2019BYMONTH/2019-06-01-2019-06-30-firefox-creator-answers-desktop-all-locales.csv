Does the (relatively large) number of tabs cause this behavior?
</p><p>I also have another FFox session with only 3 open tabs, and it behaves ""normally"", with the Favorites line visible, and the Action line.  
Certainly, I can close lots of the 72 tabs to see if things will behave more normally.  
Can anyone confirm this (large # of tabs) is the root cause?  
Are there perhaps any other suggestions which might allow normal behavior with large number of open tabs?  Thanks!

However the JSON response, instead of being returned by calling the response handler is instead overlaid on top of the page which made the AJAX request.  I have attached a screenshot displaying this.  The JSON response is encased in &lt;pre&gt;.  I know my code is not doing this because there is no occurrence of that string in my code.  The JSON itself is valid according to JsonLint.  So why is my response handler not being called, and where is this overlay coming from?  I am using the code from JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition, by David Flanagan. Copyright 2006 O'Reilly Media, Inc.  (ISBN: 0596101996) to send the AJAX request, fixed to invoke JSON.parse instead of the JS interpreter to handle the response.  I am running Firefox 67.0.4 on Ubuntu 19.04.

Sometimes a screen appears asking me to start a firefox account to sync bookmarks etc - just add my email and password, which I do and it tells me my password is wrong. Which it isn't.
So I try another email and password. Again it tells me its wrong.
Argh. Stuck in a tech black hole and can't get out! Help please...!

As you can tell im rather upset about this would it be so hard to put an option in the menu to set focus on search bar not address bar so that the people who are used to it one way don't have to spend a chunk of their day trying to get their homepage and Firefox back to the way it was, Useful.

</p><p>It looks like the (usually perfect) CCleaner Windows utility cleared all of my Firefox history. I also just did a Windows Update but I don't think that did it. This was a very focused cleansing. In places.sqlite, the table moz_historyvisits is empty. Neither mos-places nor moz_bookmarks reference any of the sites that I've visited.
</p><p>I really don't understand how that happened. I did not do a purge or reset or any other Firefox operation. I do not have any addons that purge history. The last Firefox update was several days ago. For purposes now that's not relevant.
</p><p>I looked in the bookmarkbackups folder and got yesterday's backup, but that file only has bookmarks, no history. (I searched for title text from a site that I visited yesterday and it wasn't there.)
</p><p>Question 1 : Aside from local user-managed backups, is there any other place where I might find a copy of places.sqlite and/or all of the history links?
</p><p>Question 2 : I'd like to understand why there is a bookmarkbackups folder, but not a historybackups folder. I'm guessing this is related to security, but we don't even have the option.
</p><p>Question 3 : Maybe I'm missing something or looking in the wrong place. Is there an option to save history somewhere? There are a lot of addons to clear history, but I don't see one for saving it.
</p><p>Question 4 : I haven't looked in my Android folders yet (I need root access or a remote explorer to see the Firefox data (sigh) ) ... Does anyone know if there might be a backup of history in my phone from that app?
</p><p>I posted another note in the forum area for Sync to see if there might be a backup of my history still available on a server which was shared with my Firefox/Android app.

I have Arch Linux and the latest pacman Version of Firefox 67.0.4 (64-bit)
When I surf with many tabs one tab will load an the other not. The same issue with the private mode.
First I was thinking about my firewall but its not a problem with Opera or the nativ Browser of Budgie Desktop on Arch Linux. This issue is only since last update of firefox and I also tested the devlopmend version and is the same problem.
</p><p>Please fix soon as possible

To test my new Progressive Web App and its Service-Worker, I'd like to switch off temporary firefox from the network access. For this purpose, I though to use File-&gt;""Work Offline"". What I observe is that in ""Work Offline"" mode the access to internet is disable (as I expect) but the access to my local web server for development is still avalaible (and I'm surprise about this behavior).
To make sure that the Browser cache is not responsible for this behavior, I have clear the cache and disable the cache. Still I get the unexpected behavior: In ""Work Offline"" mode, Firefox can still request and download data from a localhost server!
If I stop my localhost server, then Firefox complains about the missing data. Which is what I expect and what I also would like to see in ""Work Offline"" mode.
What is the expected behavior of the ""Work Offline"" mode for the local servers? Is the current behavior a bug?
I have also tried Chromium and it behaves as I expect, i.e. in ""Work Offline"" mode access to internet AND local servers are prevented.
I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 and Firefox 67.0.3 (64-bit)

Right now I use the detour through pdf as a workaround, but it would be nice if we could just Lasercut from the Web directly.

But last year the ESR that supported the old APIs went away and I upgraded to the latest version of Quantum.  In the past year, every time there's a major upgrade to Quantum, my browser reverts to ESR.  It completely disrupts my day because I have to spend an entire day backing up my profile, uninstalling the browser, reinstalling the browser, adding all my addons again, getting all my addons set back up the way I like it, etc.
</p><p>This has been going on for over a year now and it's driving me crazy!  I've done everything I can think of.  I've changed my upgrade channel (<a href=""http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=2280605)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=2280605)</a>, doesn't work.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled the entire browser, doesn't work.  I've uninstalled, deleted my entire profile data folder, and reinstalled, doesn't work.  
</p><p>What do I have to do to stop Firefox from forcing me back into ESR?!?!?!?!?  Do I need to entirely format my whole computer before I can use Firefox Quantum in peace?  Mozilla, you make it really hard to want to use your products.

I also tried syncing while both tablet and pc were in incognito mode, but no tabs are shown in the incognito window either.
</p><p>I could understand if it were designed this way. Personally, I think the whole instruction on firefox sync is too basic and should be expanded. I was thinking about doing it myself but I wanted to run this particular functionality by the community before I consider it a fact.
</p><p>Edit: I'm also unable to send open tabs from pc to tablet, incognito or not. I have v67.0.4 on pc and 67.0.3 on android. As far as I know, the only way to interact with your firefox account in the mobile version is to go to settings -&gt; account. Synced bookmarks go to a new bookmark folder, e.g. desktop-bookmarks. Same for history. But I don't know where to look for synced tabs. I'd expect them to just appear among your opened tabs as soon as you sync you account, but that clearly doesn't happen. But the fact that [right-click tab-&gt; send to device] on a desktop tab lists the tablet as a target, and even displays a SENT! message, suggests that it should be possible.

At the office we use roaming profiles. Until now everything worked fine.

Many users get an error that their profileversion doesn't match the firefox version.
I have the TS on version 67.0.4 but the client computers have most 67.0.3 because updates do not happen at the same moment. Updates will be applied when computer is on but nobody is logged in.
But if somebody already on 0.4 version goes to a computer with version 0.3 they get an error. 
They need to create a new profile and then they can update ...
Then they call me where are their favorites etc ..... Then I restore their profile and everything is working again as it should But the version error I never had and we already use this sins 01/2018 .....
If the versions difference is VERY large I can understtand .. but 67.0.3 / 37.0.04 is just a minor update.
So tonight i'm forced to update all computers to make everything even .......

</p><p>Here's some feedback.
</p><p>I noticed that there's something missing.  Well,... If you were to manage to handle it, you may be THE FIRST ONES TO HAVE IT IN YOUR BROWSER !
</p><p>What i am talking about is a ""rolling"" theme.  With which I mean a continuously changing theme, as follows.
</p><p>An example would be that a user could be able to e.g. chose 5 (or more) different themes and that these would roll at the top of the browser, with a preset time of x seconds or x minutes, either to be determined by the  user or by Mozilla.  Here I believe it will all depend on the type of software you will be able to build and of the security for the browser, no ?
</p><p>Out of experience, I know that this technology exists, having been a webmaster and having built and serviced 5 websites on different subjects.
In order to recuperate some of the money I spend on the costs of the webspace, programs, etc, I added quite a few, but not too much, publicity banners on these websites.
The banners led either to click-through, buys, etc. and herewith I earned a certain amount, not enough to get all of the money back, but that was never my purpose.
</p><p>Now, if I remember well, these banners were made in Javascript or Java.  If someone with you knows either which language, then my proposal could be of effect very soon.
</p><p>Lots of success and many thanks for your help !

In order to rectify this I need to restart Firefox and re-enter my pin (on a site which requires it). If an external application uses the Yubikey as a PIV card (for example Windows Remote Desktop) the dialog asking for the pin (within Firefox) opens. If the box is closed repeatedly without entering anything in the text field (eg holding down the Esc key) the box re-opens forever. If the something is entered into the box, then there seems to be *a chance* of the box closing and staying closed, but if this happens the box will re-appear whenever any traffic goes between the browser and the site requiring the use of the Yubikey (navigation to a new page, submitting a form etc). This seems to happen regardless of whether or not the input to that dialog is the correct pin for the card, or random text.
</p><p>The Yubikey is available to Firefox using OpenSC - the card is configured pointing to ""C:\Program Files\ OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\onepin-opensc-pkcs11.dll"". Logging into the Yubikey within the Firefox security devices settings view does not seem to change its behaviour with respect to this issue.
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and navigate to a site which requires the use of PIV functionality and enter the correct pin for the card.
2. Start an external application and run it in a way which also requires the PIV functionality of the Yubikey.
3. Go back to Firefox and refresh the page.
4. Enter the correct pin for the card OR mash keyboard.
5. Restarting Firefox will resolve the issue, until another external program which uses the Yubikey as a PIV card is run again.

Ever since, I have been unable to view videos from <a href=""http://vk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vk.com</a>. If I click on the video, it goes to the blank screen as though it is going to load, but the blank screen just sits there. There is no error message. Other sites, such as You Tube, seem to work fine. If I access <a href=""http://vk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vk.com</a> from either Chrome or Opera, the videos load and play without a problem. On the Flash plugin, I have it set to ""ask to activate"". It does not ask the permission on <a href=""http://vk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vk.com</a>. I have also tried to set the plugin to ""always activate"", but that does not work either. Since I can load and play the videos on the other browsers, I assume something with Firefox, either in my settings or in conjunction with Flash, is the issue. By the way, I did the upgrades because I got a message from vk when trying to play a video that my Flash was out of date.

Moving the entire toolbar with it is distracting and annoying - the ""ez fix"" is to always show it  (this disables the ALT functionality). This however means that I know have to have a large menubar that I never use and which means that the top of my browser is not dedicated to tabs (requiring more accuracy for clicking them using the mouse rather than ctrl+tab). I typically have quite few tabs but like to quickly move my cursor to the top of my screen and then clicking the tab i desire. This is blocked by the menubar, so ANY help in removing it would be absolutely fantastic. (I have yet to found any plugins or articles on this, that were not from 4+ years ago and non-functional)

None worked.

</p><p>So official Mozilla articles about this are not helping at all. It s really disappointing to see people reporting this serious problem since 2012 and still a permanent fix to it has not been provided by Mozilla.
Please, I need some volunteer who would think out of the box and give a comprehensive solution.
</p><p>Note: One of the many suggestions in the official articles asks us to manually delete or rename the profile.ini file. I am reluctant to do this UNLESS I AM REASSURED that last session windows and tabs if Firefox opens with the new profile will not be lost. I mean the new profile wont open them obviously, but if I switch back to the old profile I need those to open.

</p><p>Now when I re-installed Firefox on my desktop yesterday and placed my good backup of the profile into the proper profile folder, which is exactly like I want everything , all is good at this point, I then sign in to Sync and instantly the ""bad"" sync comes ""in"" and garbles everything into a mess.
</p><p>So my question is whether there is a way (I'm sure it's simple, I'm just dense) to use this current Firefox on my desktop to be the ""master"" that all other devices sync to? I just described above what happens when I set it exactly like I like it then sign in to sync, so that's no good as a solution.

</p><p>I have gone to Options, Privacy &amp; Security, and unchecked the box next to ""Block websites from automatically playing sound"". This did nothing. It still blocks Youtube videos from playing until I click on the video window.

</p><p>I have also gone to the exceptions page and added Youtube as an exception. Firefox still is not allowing autoplay (with and without the ""Block websites..."" box checked).
</p><p>Does someone know of something I am missing? This only occurred after the 66 update, and I've been trying to undo it as it is becoming very annoying for me.

Then I read that I should wait for Ubuntu's version. So I went to the Ubuntu software site and downloaded 65.01. That downloaded and installed itself automatically, which is what I expected. 
Then I saw several news blogs from the last 48 hours saying there was a bug that needed fixing immediately. I followed the information and downloaded FF 67.01. And then my archiver program said it could not open it because it was not the right archive type. 
I also saw something on your site about FF being self updating. That's not happening, either. 
Bottom line, I have a new but dangerously buggy version of FF, and apparently no way to upgrade it.

Firefox always worked just fine until i did the manual windows update, now anything i do, whether scrolling, switching tabs, clicking something, will cause Firefox to lag and hang for several seconds before going on. Usually when i start up, it is just fine, then after about 5 minutes once i actually try to do anything, it starts the hanging. i notice that my computer fan sometimes will kick on almost exactly when the hanging begins as well... Google chrome works just fine, but I really don't want to switch browsers since I love Firefox and have all my bookmarks and logins on it, and I dont want to go back to a previous windows version. I have tried every single step in all the trouble shooting guides posted here, and nothing fixed it. Any help?

All way ok, to start with ... once I added 4-5 emails on top of my main one, things started to get strange and some of the verification emails generated a ""Error: You must be signed in to your Firefox Account."" however I was signed in to sync and other monitor tabs were open!
Eventually I used Chrome, which seemed happier to add the other 50 historic family and work emails and activate them.
Last night I used Firefox and all was ok seeing the data.
Today I cannot log in via firefox (I can to my sync account just fine) and have even reset the password. 
I know the new password has propogated as the old password generates a ""bad password"" error. The same error, see pic below, and a new error randomly alternate.
I have tried ctrl F5, clearing the cache, cookies, etc etc, same result
I have tried different PC's same result, 3 in total, all had to be relogged in with new sync password, but none will access the monitor site.
Sometimes, from the login screen showing the email and pciture I get my picture, sometimes not, sometimes it fails with an error (sorry no picture) before the password is requested. The same you must be signed in error is the message, so same picture as below.
</p><p>HELP!! :-( 
What else can I do or is this some system/server error?

I backed up my Profile folder first and then did the uninstall/install. I then reinstalled the add-on that had been having a problem. The good news is that my problem was resolved. The bad news was that I needed to restore as much of my old configuration setup and things like history and bookmarks. The latter item was fairly simple, I just had to copy places.sqlite from my old profile folder to the new profile folder. Then I reinstalled the other add-ons which had been installed on my previous config. So far so good. 
The next task, which was probably the most complex and possibly troublesome was to actually restore all of the changes that had been made by me and Firefox itself to the actual config options. Although I didn't keep track over the years, I had made dozens of config changes to fix problems or to get Firefox to work the way I wanted it to. These changes were all made after searching on sites like this, so they were not done capriciously. So I wanted to restore these changes. I copied the prefs.js file from my old profile into the new profile. The only problem I noticed was the that the icons for all the add-ons disappeared from the area to the right of the address bar and search bar. 
I don't know what this area is called, but it also includes the 'hamburger"" icon to open the Firefox menu.
</p><p>Can anyone tell me which config option this is, or is it controlled by something else?

1262527,2019-06-19 23:27:58 UTC,2019-06-20T03:58:03Z,How can I save a Firefox  (64bit) Update file to a backup device,"<p>I am Windows 10 (64 bit) Build 1903
I always update to the latest version of Firefox.
I can do this automatically to my Laptop  from Firefox.
What I would like to do directly from the Firefox Site is download the update file  (approx 45Mb) to  a backup device first.
My reason is that if for some reason my  Hard disk fails   or the pc gets corrupted ,once fixed I can reinstall Firefox from my backup device rather than have to go to the Website and select download from there.
Until recently I used to update Firefox (and other programs) via the <a href=""http://filehippo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">filehippo.com</a> site.
Recently that site seems to have become flawed. It shows a new update version  e.g xxx.167      but when one selects that to download  it is in fact an earlier version e.g xxx.154. That filehippo comment applies to many other programs too.

Things were changed but not for the better. The first problem I had with bookmarks was resolved by a nice, helpful person on this forum. But I have more bookmark problems.
</p><p>1) All of the bookmark folders that had been open in the previous release I was on were all closed after the upgrade. Now I can't scroll down the bookmarks (""Show All Bookmarks"") to find what I want as all of the folders were closed and I couldn't see what was in them, not the entries nor the sub-folders. I have been going through the annoying and time consuming process of going to each folder one at a time and opening it again. Is there some way to fix this awful FF upgrade ""feature"" and open all of the bookmark folders at one time?
</p><p>2) Even though I I've been manually going through the bookmark folders (in ""Show all bookmarks"") to open them, when I use Ctl-D to bookmark a URL the folders are still closed. So I can't see what similar URL was saved where. Nor can I see the sub-folders. So question #2:  is there a way to force FF to re-open all folders (and show the sub-folders) in the Ctl-D function when it displays the bookmark folder list without having to  manually open each folder a second time in the CTl-D function?.

We use a website, where you can use certificates for authentication.
The website offers different certificates for different subsites. When entering the site I have to choose one of the certificates available to login.
</p><p>My question is:
Is or will it be possible to start the browser using a command line option to automatically select the certificate. Of course this requires the command line option for the url.
</p><p>Examples:
/usr/bin/firefox <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> -certificate name_of_certificate1 -&gt; redirects to subsite 1
/usr/bin/firefox <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> -certificate name_of_certificate2 -&gt; redirects to subsite 2

I am able to successfully log into the user authenticated website without difficulty and begin to download various files. However, I will suddenly encounter a ""401"" web page when I attempt to download a file - the 401 web page states that my accesss has been disconnected. I have found that if I refresh this 401 web page then select the browser's back button, I will be able to download the file. But, if I proceed to attempt to download other files, I may be successful but will usually encounter the same 401 web page when I attempt to download a subsequent file.
</p><p>As I indicated above, this problem is new to me, in that it appears to have started to occur in recent weeks. Additionally, sometimes when I am attempting to download a file, a login dialog box will appear center screen requesting my user name and password. The text that appears in this login dialog box states that the website that I am viewing is not requesting the login and will not be sent to the website that I am viewing, so I simply disregard the login dialog box and close it and repeat my attempt to download the file, which I am usually able to accomplish successfully.

I have not made any changes to my computer or Firefox that would account for these strange occurances, and I most certainly do have antivirus and antimalware software active on my computer. However, I do not know if any of the new features associated with the recent Firefox updates or any configuration settings may be the source of this problem.

No way to reload my saved logins into firefox. Every time I restart firefox with the correct logins.json (the old one renamed) it does not connect to sync and it told me to re-connect to sync. Then, it rename the logins.json and create another file with no saved logins.

If I delete the ""places.sqlite"" and ""places.sqlite-wal"" files in my profile, all history is removed, but the problem re-occurs the next time I open the browser.
Checking the integrity of the places data base returns a ""The task queue was cleared by an error in another task"" error (this happened both initially, as well as after closing/restaeting firefox as well as a complete reboot of the machine).

Previously, when typing part of a previously visited/bookmarked url on the location bar, Firefox would give autocompleting the URL a higher priority (higher on the drop down list) than, say, suggesting searches, which suited me perfectly. Now for some reason they have decided to switch things over, and now I have to scroll down the suggestions list to find the autocompleted URL. This is absolutely annoying. Why did they do that and most importantly, how can I change it back?

1262112,2019-06-15 20:32:26 UTC,2019-06-15T20:32:26Z,Firefox loses connection and cannot restart,"<p>Generally after 2 to 5 hours of use, Firefox cannot connect to the internet anymore (and loses active connections such as from the Facebook Messenger page). When trying to close it, one process of firefox.exe will always stay active and also cannot be killed by the Windows Task Manager. Also restarting the program does not work, since it cannot start due to another instance already running. By then the only solution is rebooting the computer.
</p><p>This is going on now for about a week. I have had Firefox running on this laptop (Dell Precision M2800, Windows 7 Ultimate) as my major browser without major problems for years and have not recently installed any new software, but this is now becoming unworkable.
</p><p>The only things that have been the same for all times that it happened is that I had more than one window open with multiple tabs in at least one of the 2 windows and the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/messages"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com/messages</a> page was open in the multiple tabs screen (since it is the tab that always stays open for me). Also the process of all the running firefox.exe instances that cannot be ended via any way, always uses around 300MB (±50MB) of memory.
</p><p>What I have tried so far:
</p><p>-Rolling back to version 66.0.4 (hoping it was a version related problem).
</p><p>-Full scan of my computer for viruses and malware.
</p><p>-Removing the original profile.
</p><p>-Uninstalling Firefox, including manually removing the Firefox related folders in AppData and Program Files and re-installing the latest version. Not installing any plug-ins or importing any of the previous settings or data.

1262072,2019-06-15 07:31:30 UTC,2019-06-15T22:12:28Z,Extremely High VRAM Usage,"<p>Hey Everyone, first post here,
</p><p>So I love Firefox, it's my browser of choice, has been for about 2 years now. But I have been dealing with an issue this entire time and I cannot seem to solve it no matter what I do. I even bought a 3rd freaking GPU for my rig to dedicate to FireFox and still no luck (yes, the GPU is used for other stuff, but Firefox is it's only use when I am doing basic browsing). 
</p><p>All this comes down to VRAM usage. I commonly keep around 50-80 tabs open in Firefox. But it will eat up all my VRAM and them some on my GPU, and I have 8GB. I've caught it using 7GB of that, and probably more that was in the background shuffled into system RAM since VRAM was full (1GB was used for Windows for basic display tasks). And if I am watching a video, and then switch to a tab that hasn't been loaded in a while, the entire browser craps out and freezes for about 3-6 seconds before it stabilizes again. I'm pretty sure that the VRAM is being shuffled back from system RAM to VRAM for use. 
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why the crap Firefox uses so much VRAM? I have tested this on multiple OS installs, multiple Firefox versions, 4 differnt computers, etc.... And they all have the same issue, high VRAM usage that ends up causing lag later down the road. This is really frustrating for me because it makes the browser completely unusable, and I don't want to stop using it because it's so much better than Chromium at literally everything else. 
</p><p>Oh and before you ask, yes I have tried uninstalling all plugins as well, still no luck (and the plugins across all 4 machines matched anyway when I was testing with plugins).

1) We have an application which is accessible inside our network and the application is in PCF cloud, In this application we have a report tab which generates the report to our user. 
</p><p>User scenario:
1) When the user tries to generate a report from UI our app does a Http Get request, if the browser receives response below 5 minutes, it is able to download the file but if the response takes more than 5 minutes(For eg: 7minutes)
the browser keeps on loading.
</p><p>My Findings:
1) I have figured out that from the back end logs we have broken pipe(Connection was aborted), I am trying to find  out is the connection is getting aborted from the Firefox browser?
</p><p>2) From ""google chrome"" browser we are receiving the response even though response takes more than 5 minutes.
</p><p>Tried out:
1) I have tried changing ""network.http.response.timeout"" and ""network.http.keep-alive.timeout"" and they didn't work for me. But when I made changes to ""network.http.request.max-attempts"" to 1 the browser stops loading after 5 inutes.
</p><p>I am not sure, is this a browser issue? or is this some router configuration issue? or is something else?
</p><p>Could some one enlighten me? 
</p><p>If it is not a browser issue then I could check in other appropriate areas to find the cause.

This letter was translated by Google Translation, so sorry if the language is not so correct.
I recently noticed that my Internet is being used without my knowledge, which means that the network icon next to the clock indicates that there is data communication but there is no software I use on the Internet.
I suspected that someone was hacking into my computer or having spyware or a virus on my computer so I installed NetLimiter to find some software that uses the Internet without my knowledge.
To my surprise, I discovered that FireFox and Internet Download Manager (IDM) software download data (and lots) even though these software interfaces show that there is no data transfer. Moreover, even after I close FireFox, NetLimiter detects that FireFox continues to download data!
I checked the IP address from which these programs are downloading data, I copied the IP address to the browser and to my surprise the main page of ... Google. For some reason FireFox and IDM download data from Google, and for some reason neither show it nor ask for permission, and of course I can not stop downloading data through them except with NetLimiter.
So why does FireFox download data from Google without my knowledge and without my permission ?!

The way my windows are arranged on my screens I need to drag a file from the far left to the far right (into my new email message) of my screens, crossing over FireFox. If my mouse crosses over the FireFox browser while doing this the attachment does NOT attach into the email. If I minimize FireFox and follow the same path it will attach as normal. If I drag it across the bottom windows taskbar, the only clear path from left to right that is not over FireFox, it will attach as normal. I have tried with different types of files (pdf, images, excel, word) with the same results.
</p><p>Is there a way to disable ALL the drag and drop features in FireFox so this ""dragging over"" FireFox isn't an issue any longer?
</p><p>I know there are more simple work arounds, such as rearranging my windows so I don't have to drag files across FireFox, but I have had my windows arranged the same way for 5+ years and after trying to do this for an hour it's just not going to work out for me. I can run this browser based program in Chrome (which is what I normally use) but there are issues with that as well when opening web links from my email. I would like to continue to use FireFox for my browser based pos system (which is the only thing I will use FireFox for) but the inconvenience of not being able to drag files across it will probably prompt me to try a different browser.

Going to use BBC iPlayer I find that I cannot sign in either to BBC home page or on BBC iPlayer page. In either case clicking on the ""Sign In"" link initiates a page refresh (refresh symbol cycles, although the page does not) and nothing else. This is a new install, so has no history, nevertheless I cleared cache and history; no difference. I then followed the remove corrupt cookie file instruction: no effect.
Unless I can sign in I cannot use iPlayer, which is a significant problem for me. Switching to Edge, no problem.
Further I have now discovered that the same problem exists on my desktop system (currently Firefox 67.0.1, update on restart, 64bit Windows 10) but the other way round. Here I am signed in to the BBC web site but again clicking the account button simply cycles the refresh symbol. So here I cannot sign out of the BBC. I don't want to clear cache etc here because I would then be signed out and probably unable to sign back in.
I have uploaded this problem from my desktop Firefox (the signed in one but with the same issue) and that is the attached Troubleshooting Information

</p><p>While I haven't experienced many ""true"" crashes, I have dealt with times where the browser would refresh itself to the point that anything I type would disappear. 
</p><p>I have also experienced heavy input lag when typing on forums. Some websites won't even allow me to use my phone's (Galaxy S7) back function or even the browser's back function. Most websites take much longer to load than on other mobile browsers.
</p><p>Finally, the user interface for the mobile browser is severely lagging compared to the desktop browser. For example, there is no way to access the full brewing history, and the amount that you can view is very limited. Also, internet connection is required to view tabs that have been previously opened. This is a huge detriment as I tend to work in areas with no internet access. Other browsers will at least save the last viewed section to allow offline reading.
</p><p>In short, I feel that more work needs to be done for the mobile browser, which is a shame because I believe that the desktop version is top notch. 
</p><p>I want to thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my comments.

New tabs would randomly show dead blank pages and refuse to load anything.  New tabs work about half the time, half the time unresponsive.  Half the time opening firefox fresh wont respond unless I have done a system restart just before- then it always works every time.  Its a real pain to copy the address from an unresponsive tab to paste into a working tab to view the page!  When I reverted back to v63- everything worked fine again- except (of course) the Addon signing bug prevents my addons from working.  I was happy to stay on v63 until the Addon signing bug happened- pages always loaded and addons had worked.
So I have a dilemma- choose either: no addons working anymore in v63 but all tabs loading properly, or addons working normally in v67 but new tabs and the main program only working about half the time.  Why cant I have both- working tabs and working addons.
I have tried a firefox v67 reset to default, and then re-customised it &amp; reloaded my addons but no fix.  What is wrong?  What has Mozilla done to cause the formerly working v63 to fail half the time somewhere between v63 and v67?  How do I fix it?

The contents of %APPDATA%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&lt;profile that I'm using&gt; get deleted when I log out, confirmed by accessing the filesystem from another computer.

</p><p>- Re-create the profile from the Profile manager and use a new one.
</p><p>- Turn off my antivirus software.
</p><p>- Uninstall Firefox completely and remove the contents of the profile folders manually before re-installing Firefox from the newest version.

You then go to hover over where it normally would be, on the top right corner, and then the close window box turns red to close. So it still thinks it's full size, but it's not.  I can restart in safe mode and then it works, but as soon as you close and reopen, it goes back to mini Firefox.  Attached is the image of what I see.

I have a legacy Windows app called ""URL Address Book"" which I have used for many years. It's function is similar to the 'Bookmarks' feature of modern browsers. I think it's basically just a database of url's plus several elements which include a Name, Location (url), Category, Last Visit Date, etc. I think it just sends the url to the browser, a new tab opens, and navigation to the website occurs. (I'm probably not getting all of the technical terms right, so bear with me.) The user interface is simply a pane of folders (for organizing saved websites) and another pane listing websites to visit (see image attached). This is an old legacy app which has not been supported in years, but it has always worked up to FF vs. 67.
</p><p>With vs. 67 a very strange thing started happening. When I double click on the row for the website I wish to visit, instead of opening a tab and navigating to the selected website, what I get is two (2) more instances of FF launched, both of which open to my standard Home Page settings. So, assuming I already have one instance of FF running, I now have three running and none of them have a tab with the website I selected open! Really weird behavior. I hate to have to scrap the app, because it's very handy. I can keep it open to the side and I'm used to using it.

My browser of choice is Firefox (for obvious reasons!) but my productivity tool of choice is Alfred (<a href=""http://www.alfredapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.alfredapp.com</a>).
</p><p>Alfred and Firefox do not work well together. At all. This is a shame because Alfred works really well with Chrome, which was my default browser up until about a year ago.
</p><p>The most important feature of Alfred-Firefox interoperability is being able to quickly open one of the browser's bookmarks. As you can see from this thread (<a href=""https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/11724-firefox-bookmark-search/)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/11724-firefox-bookmark-search/)</a>, I have been asking for this integration for a LONG time without any success until very recently - but even that success has a caveat.
</p><p>Alfred lacks native support for working with Firefox's bookmarks because Firefox doesn't make this possible. The browser locks its bookmarks away in a database. A workaround has been implemented using a Python-based workflow which depends on Firefox's old ""export bookmarks"" feature which is then uses to parse the resulting HTML file. However, this file is only updated when the browser is closed so if someone was to save a lot of bookmarks in a single session, those bookmarks would be unavailable to them in Alfred until that session ended and another was started. This seems archaic.
</p><p>Could Firefox engineers find a more elegant way for Alfred - and similar tools since we're all inclusive here! - to work with its bookmarks, perhaps making it as easy as it is to do so with Chrome?

So each time I open Firefox 1Password asks me to update it to the latest version, but even if I then close everything down and return to Firefox again later the same day, it has once again reverted back to the old version.  I am not having this issue on Chrome or Edge (I've checked) and it is getting to the point where I am considering moving browsers, because Firefox is not keeping my changes or updates to extensions, between sessions.
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Pro, and recently upraded to Firefox 67.0.1, but I am still having the same issues.  Please can someone help me fix this!?
</p><p>I have also tried ""resetting"" the extensions and add-ons as per other advice and guidance, but this had no effect.  I have also spoken to 1Password support, who have looked into it and think it is likely a Firefox issue.

</p><p>Can anyone help me with this please?
I have a new desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen 3.6Ghz Quad Core processor, using Windows 10 and 
a Samsung ML - 33101D laser printer. The printer has been properly set up by an IT guy and all the right drives are in place. He has also confirmed and checked there are no issues with the printer or the PC itself, so it must be my firefox broswer.
I like using Firefox for all its features but now when I print just a couple of pages from the internet it takes about 40 seconds to print them but when I print from the same website on Google Chrome it takes 5 seconds. So its very frustrating as I often print up 50 pages a day! 
Has anyone got any suggestions or solutions to this problem? I am not very techy so please keep the language simple or give me specific steps to the solution if possible.
Thank you in advance,

Every time I go to download a .pdf, Firefox will ask 'what do you want firefox to do?'.  I have selected 'open with adobe reader (default)', and have the 'do this every time' box checked. 
It will then open the file to view on the screen.  If I close it and click the same download button, it ask the question again, totally ignoring the 'every time' checked box.
These files are standard Adobe .pdf and should be recognizable by Firefox every single time, but it acts like its never seen the file type before.  I've tried a couple of different solutions but nothing works.
Any ideas?

1261506,2019-06-10 08:24:24 UTC,2019-06-11T07:54:46Z,Firefox Monitor: support for email addresses with arbitrary plus sign tags,"<p>Whenever i create an account anywhere, i use an email address with a tag unique to the service appended to the end. For instance, the email address I used here is firstname.lastname+mozillasupport@gmail.com. I do this to be able to automatically put incoming emails in various buckets, and also to be able to mute emails from specific senders or see which services sell my address on to spam spewers.
</p><p>In firefox monitor, this creates a problem, because as far as Firefox is concerned I use hundreds of different email addresses, whereas in reality they are all the same address just with different tags.
</p><p>So I would be massively helped by the following feature:
When you add an email address to Firefox Monitor, there is a checkbox that says ""Include address variations"".
When adding the address firstname.lastname@gmail.com with the checkbox checked, any variation of that email address should also be considered added, e.g.
firstname.lastname+dropbox@gmail.com
firstname.lastname+netflix@gmail.com
firstname.lastname+hbo@gmail.com
</p><p>Bonus feature: Support for service specific quirks - the checkbox would also be aware of quirks various email providers have. E.g. for gmail addresses the dots are optional. So when adding the address firstname.lastname@gmail.com with the aforementioned checkbox checked, the address would also match firstnamelastname@gmail.com.

I enter my credentials for syncing and it asks to verify my login using my mail. After verifying firefox syncs with my account but after this the toolbar customization and my home page resets to default ones although my home page has the frequently visited sites it fails to save the pinned sites. Similarly my toolbar has add-ons which were removed from it and I have to make the changes again and again almost every week.
The theme and the extension don't reset this only affects the homepage and toolbar. I've tried re-installing firefox but it does not help. Also starting it in safe mode does not help.

If I do all that every time I want to make an exception, will all my previous exceptions be saved?

</p><p>In the first attached image, you can see the shortcut configured in the `Shortcuts` pane of macOS' System Preferences application.
</p><p>In the second image, you can see Firefox's `File` menu open, and verify that the shortcut is correctly assigned to ""New Private Window"", where it has replaced the default ⌘⇧P.
</p><p>However, as I said above, the custom key combination doesn't work - it seems to in fact trigger the regular ""New Window"", which is still the default ⌘N (command+N, no shift key).
</p><p>Any one know if this is a known issue, and if there are any solutions?
</p><p>Using a different key combination is not useful for me, since I'm trying to switch from Chrome and have ⌘⇧N very ingrained in my behavior (I pretty much always use private windows unless I need to log in to a site or explicitly want the history saved). If I can't have ⌘⇧N then I might as well just try to adjust to the default ⌘⇧P.
</p><p>The fact that executing the shortcut brings up a non-private window makes the whole thing much worse - I'm ending up using non-private windows when I think I'm using private ones :/

</p><p>Since a few days, I have been having this problem of not being able to properly use several tabs at the same time anymore. For example, this is tab 3 and I just clicked on tab 2 and Firefox just <em>forgets</em> what it was (blank page) and then reloads the page. Also with YouTube playing, the song just randomly stops after a while.
This is all really really annoying.
I thought it was a problem with unnecessary reloading, and switched off <em>automatic reloading</em> in config, but then what I got was a blank page and no reloading. So, essentially Firefox just forgets what I was doing. I did a Firefox <em>Refresh</em> but it hasn't really fixed the problem.
I think I had this problem sometimes in the past but those were exceptions and now it's a constant happening.

I have been a Firefox user for as long as I can remember, and I even donate from time to time, but this is the first time I am considering abandoning this Browser for Chrome (which I just find an annoying browser to be honest). I hope someone can help me, because I cannot find any info about this problem and don't really know what to look for either.

Firefox is great with a youtube video download add-on, recently Firefox was asking me to restart with the latest Firefox version 67.01, My youtube downloader was working fine so I put the Firefox restart off till another day and continued for around a week downloading my favourite drummer vids, all was TickaDeeBoo until I decided to go for the latest Firefox 67.01 restart, now my video downloading days are over. I have worked my way through the list of add-on's only to find none of them do the trick. Every time I choose a downloader add-on I click on MP4 360 as it has the audio too, other options are with no audio, no good to anyone. Once clicked, my download destination appears, I click save to store the video in my downloads, in the top right hand corner next to View History &amp; Saved Bookmarks etc is the downward pointing download confirmation arrow which lights up immediately but sadly shows as 0 MegaBytes. Where as when the add-on was working that same downloading arrow would only light up once it had truely downloaded the chosen video. Its really funny you know because about 2months ago I was using an add-on that would only bring up downloading options (MP3,MP4 etc) if you avoided clicking actually on the word ""Download"", In other words clicking not on the word but away from the word but still inside the box, how weird is that, but it worked everytime, sadly no more. I am a Drummer who follows the lives of my favourite world class Drummers, its great when an add-on works, sound &amp; vision. But when its not working all I can do is record the audio and make do with that. I have been saving in my youtube play list all the video's I've not been able to download in the hope that some day soon that will all change for the better. I sincerely would be over the moon to have this feature back even if its just for a short while (until it all goes pair shaped again) TO THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY, ANY IDEAS ???  Kind Regards, Jonathan.

I have tried various permutations of:
1: Start Firefox
2. Remove check mark from ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" under ""View"" - ""Toolbars""
3. Restart Firefox in ""Safe Mode""
4. Enable ""Menu Bar"" and ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" under ""Customize"" - ""Toolbars"" (only menu bar appears)

7. Reboot PC
8. Start Firefox
9. Reenable ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" under ""View"" - ""Toolbars""

I am reluctant to do this, as I likely cannot remember all of the changes I have made to Firefox, not only under ""Preferences"", but also in ""about:config"".  I am particularly concerned about losing all of the exceptions which I have configured in the add-on uMatrix. I have saved the data from about:support, but I don't see any such informatin in the saved data.

However, the instructions appear to be out of date, as I cannot find GUI elements as described there.

This is because God exists, created us, loves us, is concerned for our being, desires to provide for us, and sent Jesus to redeem us.  If we were to ask ""What is God?"" we might be tempted to say that God is the infinite being, the creator, a presence, or something like that.  In some respect, this would be true.  But the first question brings us closer to understanding more of who God really is in His character and His love for us as revealed in the Bible.
</p><p>The Bible teaches us that in all existence, from all eternity, there has been and always will be only one God. God was never created, is completely loving, completely just, completely holy, completely merciful, and that He desires the best for us.  God is holy, and He can have nothing to do with sin as the Bible says, ""His eyes are too pure to look upon evil,"" (Hab. 1:13).  This does not mean that God cannot see what someone does that is wrong.  It is a way of describing how holy God is.  God cannot sin.  He is perfect.
</p><p>God is Trinity
In Christianity, God is a Trinity.  This means that God is three persons, not three gods.  Technically, the doctrine of the Trinity states that in the one God is the person of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each is not the same person as the other, yet there are not three gods but one (Isa. 43:10; 44:6, 8; 45:5).  This is similar in analogy to the nature of time.  Time is past, present, and future.  The past is not the same as the present, which is not the same as the future.  But, there are not three times.  There is only one thing called time.  Time is similar to God in by analogy.
</p><p>The reason the word ""person"" is used in describing God as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is because each exhibits attributes of personhood - not in a body of flesh and bones, but in personhood.  In other words, each has a will, loves, speaks, is aware of others, communicates with others, etc.  These are attributes of personhood, and we see the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each demonstrate these qualities.  That is why we say God is three persons.
</p><p>Because of the Trinity, God can become flesh in the form of the Son and still exist in such a way so that He can run the universe.  Therefore, the Son can communicate to us on our level.
</p><p>Following are a couple verses that hint at the Trinity.
</p><p>Matt. 28:19, ""Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.""
2 Cor. 13:14, ""The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.""
The Bible says there is only one God:  ""I am the Lord, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God,"" (Isaiah 45:5).  Yet, the Bible teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each called God.
</p><p>Below is a very brief chart that shows that each of the persons in the Trinity share the same attributes that only God shares.  But remember, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit each have wills and speak, etc.  Therefore, we say there are three persons.
</p><pre>	FATHER	SON	HOLY SPIRIT

Some Biblical Truths about God
God Is Truth - Psalm 117:2; Jer. 10:10
God is Light - 1 John 1:5
God is Love - 1 John 4:8, 16 
God Is Invisible - 1 Tim. 1:17
God Does Not Have A Human Body - Luke 24:39; Deut. 4:15-16
God Does Not Change - Num. 23:19; Mal. 3:6; James 1:17
God Is Without Limit - 1 Kings 8:27; Jer. 23:23-24
God Is Most Loving - 1 John 4:8-10
God Is Gracious - Exodus 33:19; 1 Pet. 2:3
God Is Merciful - Exodus 34:6; Psalm 67:1; James 5:11
God Is Long-suffering - Psalm 86:15; 2 Pet. 3:15
God Abounds In Goodness - Psalm 31:19; Psalm 52:1; Rom. 11:22
There are many more such statements about God in the Bible.  But, what is clear is that God is alive, concerned about you, has provided Jesus as a sacrifice for sins, because he is loving, merciful, and gracious.  And, of course, the best representation of God is found in Jesus (Heb. 1:3).

I tried the update to FF 67.0 and immediately realized I was unable to restore previous sessions (where I have a open windows, each with a series of tabs for specific categories of websites I often use. In 67.0, and 67.0.1 there is no longer any restore session function that I can see. If I start FF there is still no obvious way to restore those windows and tabs. And the theme seems to have changed to black tabs
</p><p>I downgraded to 66.0.5 but those windows and tabs were still gone. In my Mac's Time Machine backups I went back a few days to before the issue started, dragged out the Firefox folder and relaunched FF 67.0. Same problem - the restore data was totally gone! Went back to Time Machine, trashed the Firefox folder in ~/Users/Home/Library/Application Support and replaced it with another days older FF folder and launched from 66.0.5. All the old windows and tabs opened - but now 66.0.5 was unstable and would crash over and over, every 5-10-15 minutes for no other reason than I clicked on a link (not from a new possibly infected site, but from familiar sites like NY Times, Amazon, or similar links in the same tabs that had been restored-tabs used repeatedly. I tried going back to 66.0.4, 66.0.3, etc. Same instability that was never a problem when I last had them installed.
</p><p>It seems that just installing 67.0 left some other files, but not in the Firefox folder in  ~/Users/Home/Library/Application Support - as that folder was changed out completely. It can't be a coincidence that 66.0.5 went unstable just after 67.0 was first installed. And the new profile structure shouldn't have changed anything as I use only Firefox on my MacBook Pro and have no other installations of FF - and have no interest in syncing to my cell or anywhere else at this time.

</p><p>Das Youtube Layout ist derzeit mit dieser Firefox Version (60.7.0 ESR und der vorherigen ESR 60.3.2) kaputt: Die Vorschaubilder sind nach links verschoben und werden teilweise von dem Menü abgedeckt, oben rechts erscheinen graue Punkte und Balken, welche dem Player zugehörig sind (laut ""Element untersuchen""), klickt man auf ein Video, werden ausschließlich diese Punkte und Balken angezeigt, das Video läuft unsichtbar irgendwo im Hintergrund. 
Was ich bisher versucht habe:
- Der Cache wurde gelöscht
- Die Seite mit Strg+F5 neu geladen
- Im abgesicherten Modus gestartet
- Manuell Extensions deaktiviert im normalen Modus
- Bei Youtube ab- und neu angemeldet
- Ein neues Profil erstellt
- Hardwarebeschleunigung deaktiviert
- PC neugestartet
alles ohne Effekt.
</p><p>Ich habe mir Firefox Portable heruntergeladen und mit diesem geht es. Hat Youtube vielleicht etwas geändert, was ein Problem mit der ESR Version hervorruft? An meinem PC habe ich nichts geändert, seit Youtube das letzte mal problemlos lief (das war Donnerstag).
</p><p>Currently the Youtube layout seems to be broken in this Firefox version (60.7.0 ESR and previous 60.3.2 ESR): The thumbnails are moved left, partly covered by the menu, on the upper right some bars and dots appear, which seem to be buttons of the player (according to ??""Site Inspector""?? I don't know the english term, sorry. Right click on a part of the website, press ""Q""). If I open a video, these bars and dots are the only thing shown, while the video is played invisibly somewhere.
What I tried so far:
- Deleting the cache
- Force reload with Ctrl-F5
- Run in safe-mode
- Manually deactivated all extension while in normal mode
- Log-off and relogged-in on Youtube
- Created a new profile
- Deactivated hardware acceleration
- Rebooted PC
nothing worked.
</p><p>I downloaded Firefox portable and here Youtube works as usual. Maybe Youtube has had some changes, which only affects the ESR version of Firefox? I haven't change anything on my PC, since the last time Youtube was working fine (which was on Thursday).

</p><p>A java-s class-okat jelenleg reklámblokkolóval tiltom, de ez macerás, mert csak egyesével lehet a komponenseket tiltani és mindenképp ki kell várni az oldal betöltését, ami sok idő. Ráadásul ezek a háttérben is futnak terhelve a CPU-t. A helyi menüben - a jobb egérgombra megjelenő - az ""Elem vizsgálata"" részben leállíthatóak az animációk, de ez mire - a folyton mozgó tartalom miatt - betöltődik, az még több idő és csak ideiglenes megoldás.
</p><p>Nem tudom, hogy írhatok-e ide konkrét web címet példának, ezért inkább körbeírom a jelenséget.
Pl. #1: Amíg nem töltődik be egy oldal vagy csak egy egyszerű ""browser check"" oldal esetén, mindig valamilyen kép pattog, forog jelezvén, hogy az oldal töltődik vagy ""dolgozik"". 
</p><p>Az elem vizsgálóban ez valahogy így néz ki. (egy fogaskerék forog)
</p>
<div class=""gear"">
<p>	<img alt="""" class=""rotate"">
</p>
</div>
<p>Az animációs ablakban meg ezek vannak: (pattogó logó és két fogaskerék az oldalon)
</p><pre>img.flat.logo - floating
img.rotate - floating
img.rotate - floating
</pre>
<p>A blokkolt tartalom ublock origin-ban: (pattogó logó és két fogaskerék az oldalon)
</p><pre>##.logo.float
##.first.gear &gt; .rotate
##.second.gear &gt; .rotate
</pre>
<p>A legtöbb loader és preloader tiltható az alábbi sorokkal, de több oldal van, ami egyedi class-t használ.
</p><pre>##.loader
###loader
##.preloader
###preloader
</pre>
<p>Továbbá, ha ugyanez az oldal &lt;iframe&gt;-be töltődik haszontalan minden ublok szabály, mert a fő ablak beállításai lesznek az érvényesek, ahol nincs tiltva semmi. 
</p><p>Pl. #2: A könyvjelzők közé felvettem egy oldalt, aminek egy mozgó grafikon az ikonja. Elvileg a GIF animáció tiltott, de ez mozog és villog, ami nyitott könyvjelzők mellett nagyon zavaró. 
</p><p>Eddig ezeket a kulcsokat állítottam:
</p><pre>image.animation_mode;none //GIF animációk tiltása
media.autoplay.enabled;false //Videók lejátszásának tiltása kikapcsolva
browser.fullscreen.animate;false //Teljes képernyőre váltás animálásának kikapcsolása (F11)
browser.download.animateNotifications;false //Letöltési ikon animálásának tiltása
browser.tabs.animate;false //Fülek animálásának tiltása
</pre>
<p>Ezeket próbáltam, de hatástalan és nem is tudom mit kellene tiltania:
</p><pre>dom.animations-api.element-animate.enabled;true
layout.animated-image-layers.enabled;false
</pre>
<p>Használt böngésző és kiegészítők: 
</p><pre>FireFox ESR 52.9.0 //Tudom régi, de ez van.
uBlock origin //Szemétszűrő
NoScript //Ezekre az animációkra hatástalan, a default értékekkel.
GreaseMonkey //Tesztelés alatt, de ez is csak egyesével tud tiltani és nem értek annyira a java kódhoz.
</pre>
<p>Amennyiben nem tudtok segíteni, az is elegendő lenne, ha tudnátok ajánlani oldal(aka)t, ahol fellelhető a FireFox config kulcsairól valami részletes dokumentáció, hogy mi mire való vagy mit állít be.
</p><p>Segítségeteket előre is köszönöm.

One problem of Firefox is that sometimes it gets huge annoying changes that are impossible to fix or get back.
Although I'm not using it on any of my systems anymore but I have to see it at work, unfortunately!
I have searched and found many posts about this old behavior of Firefox:
CTRL + Enter = .com
CTRL + SHIFT + Enter = .net
CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + ENTER = .org
And many people asked how to get back this behavior, means it was easy and popular.
Also means Firefox does not give a xyz to its users on such requests!

I would just uninstall and reinstall Firefox, but 240 gigabytes is a lot and could be something important on my computer that, for some reason, is being shown as Firefox taking up 240 gigabytes. I've attached a picture to show that it really is 240 gigabytes (not megabytes).  My question is why it would be showing Firefox as taking up 240 gigabytes and if it is safe to uninstall.

</p><p>Any time i try to play a video like in youtube or facebook, my computter gets practically slower and slower, and this didn´t happen before, but now this is so anoying that i'm about to leave firefox for another browser.
</p><p>And i'll be clear, i must use microsoft edge from time to time to see videos since that browser seems to have no issue,  the thing is that with firefox the video issue gets so frequent that i have to restar my computer every 45 minutes or so, and that happends in my 2 computers i have firefox installed.
</p><p>From what i can capture from the task manager, it seems that firefox consume way to mutch power and ram when there is video playback specially in facebook….but the real issue is that Disk usage gets to 100% with no reason! over some time and stays that way freezeng my entire PC!
</p><p>In the second situation (i can´t post a image) i'm ussing Microsoft Edge, and with Facebook actually having a stream, and with that browser i still have a working pc without slowdowns or any freezes, and even if Edge shows a big ram and cpu usage, there is no visible hard disk activity, so, there is something really going on Firefox that is giving real problems over time.
</p><p>I dissabled themes, i dissabled hardware acceleration, i made many things but none of them worked, and one of my 2 compiters has 10 gigs of ram, more than enought to even manage chrome but firefox keep giving me porblems.
</p><p>What is happening with this browser, i am a firefox user since earlly 2007 or so and never had this anoying issue i am having today and for months. I´ll leave you a capture of my task manager, in my laptop that has 6 gig of ram, none of my programs make this issue but firefox does, i tested even adobe ilustrator and there is no issue with this program that consumes a lot of ram, but firefox just with facebook open and playing a video consime almost 1.5 gig of ram....is this chrome or what?
</p><p>Seriouslly i have no options left to solve this issue, HELP ME PLEASE, i don't want to go to another browser please!

<pre>what is odd also is my default speakers are set to my 5.1 surround sound and it will get changed to either my monitor speakers or a digital out port which i dont have anything hooked to.

I've noticed a very odd behaviour with Firefox Monitor (FM), which I started using today: 
I 've created my Firefox account quite some time ago using my email address SchmidtSt@web.de (written with 2 upper case ""S"") as User-ID. When I signed up for FM today, it told me ""0 breaches"" which I found odd since I know for sure from <a href=""http://haveIbeenpwned.com"" rel=""nofollow"">haveIbeenpwned.com</a> that this email address had been breached on <a href=""http://last.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">last.fm</a> (and 3 further ""unverified"" breaches).
</p><p>So I added another email address I'm using, Schmidt_St@hotmail.com (again, out of habit) written with 2 upper case ""S"". And again, to my surprise: ""0 breaches"" - ?!? That one, too, had been breached on <a href=""http://last.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">last.fm</a>, and additionally on <a href=""http://Verifications.io"" rel=""nofollow"">Verifications.io</a>.
</p><p>Thus I tried adding these two email addresses written in lower case only - and guess what? Now it works ...
</p><p>I think you should fix this, since the UI of <a href=""http://haveIbeenpwned.com"" rel=""nofollow"">haveIbeenpwned.com</a> has no problem with using upper case letters in email addresses (and for email addresses it usually makes no difference if you write them lower or upper case).
</p><p>Cheers and best regards,
Steffen Schmidt.

</p><p>As of yesterday, June 3rd, the game simply will not load.
Already tried clearing the cache, no good.  Upgraded flash, nope.
They suggested another browser.   I  have opera so tried, and it works just fine.
I don't  use opera.   Don't really want to either.  One browser is fine.
</p><p>They finally admitted they just did a game upgrade and suddenly now firefox won't work?
Sounds to me like this browser has an issue, not their game.   Since it works on another browser.
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm on version 64 and please DO NOT tell me to upgrade.   The next version will AUTO upgrade without my knowledge or permission.   VERY BAD AND STUPID IDEA TO FORCE THINGS ONTO PEOPLE!   
Let ME decide when, why, and IF I need an upgrade.    NOT YOU!    Hoping when you come out with the next version you LISTEN TO PEOPLE and stop forcing upgrades.   Bad enough I have to click ""not now"" every damn time I launch this thing.   STOP IT!!!!  This has been said by MANY PEOPLE too.   LISTEN!  STOP IT!
So an upgrade isn't happening.    If I have to I'll simply switch to opera.
Really don't want to do that.
</p><p>Hoping you can figure out why this simple game site suddenly stopped loading.   
</p><p>I will forward this post to the support person I've been talking with.    MAYBE you two can get together and figure out what went glitchy?

</p><p>I'm using Firefox on a couple of Macs and Windows 10 machines for quite some time now. And I keep tabs and bookmarks in sync with Firefox Sync. Has been working great for quite some time.
</p><p>Since somewhere last week, it started giving me headaches. It started with requiring me to log into sync again on one of the machines (can't quite remember wether it was Win10 or Mac). My password (complex 35 characters, managed by LastPass password manager) did not work. Que? OK, so I reset the password with a recovery key (2FA enabled) and was able to log in again.
</p><p>Then another machine gave me exactly the same: log in again, password wrong, only way in was to reset password, etc.
</p><p>It seems I can get either all macOS Firefoxes to sync -or- the Win10 Firefoxes to sync, but not both. I tried completely starting over with sync (deleting my account, setting it up from scratch). But still the same problem...
</p><p>I'm at my wits end with this... Anyone else having this problem? Was not able to find a reference on google or the support forums ;-(.
</p><p>I guess it started with Firefox 67.0 (which has an update as I check just now).
</p><p>Any hints or help most welcome :-D

An add-in that kills loops and moves all bookmarks to the bookmarks bar would be helpful.  Presumably it was 'AntiX' that put the propaganda in my FF bookmarks, but bookmarks, if a directed graph, seems susceptible to loops and should have defenses against loops so once garbage like Anti-X's gets in, it can be cleaned out.  Cryptically, my FF account asked me today to verify my home country  (!) -- which I did (USA).  Help appreciated, but if too much trouble would like Synch account destroyed so I can start a new one with same email.

There have been no suggestions that have worked to correct this issue. If someone wants to check this out for themselves, log into eBay and start the process to list an item. When you see all of the drop down menus to select different things (like the item condition, etc.), you will find that the menus will NOT stay open (you have to click and hold the left mouse button to make your selection).  I noticed that the drop down menus on this site won't function correctly, either.
</p><p>This is occurring with two bluetooth mice and a USB mouse as well. The operating system is MacOS 10.14.3. The problem does not occur in the versions of Firefox prior to 56 or 57 and the problem does not occur in Chrome.
</p><p>One thing I just discovered is that if I click at the very outside edge of the menus, they will usually stay open. I really would like to get this issue solved once and for all. Refreshing the browser does not change anything and neither does safe mode. I think there is some coding change within Firefox that is causing the issue.

I need them to be the same.,"<p>For work, I use Nuance Power PDF 3rd party software for editing and making changes to PDF files that I download to my hard drive. The company normally requires us to use Google Chrome for our work, but recently Chrome has been constantly failing, cannot keep up, and crashes on big files. I started using Firefox and it works great! It's very fast and download what I need 98% faster. However, there is a difference in the PDF's between Firefox and Chrome. When I use the file with Chrome I can highlight and makes corrections with the software, but when I download the exact same file through Firefox I cannot make the same changes at all. The software I use is not made just for Chrome, It does have a Firefox extension which is turned on. I was told by my boss that something is different between the Firefox and Chrome. I have gone through Firefox PDF printer settings and no matter what I do, it's the same issue. Is there a way to change how the Firefox version is different?

</p><p>I built a small web application that can extract a large zip file (around 275MB) and sends a specfic large file of the extracted contents (around 300MB) via POST request to my own web api. To do so I use the libary ""zip.js"". At first everything worked fine in all common browsers (Opera, Chrome, IE, Edge and Firefox) under different plattforms (linux and windows).
</p><p>But since the release of version 67.0 of Firefox it didn't work anymore. I already watched the packages via wireshark. Firefox sends the header of the request but does not attach the file itself.
</p><p>I already tested my web application with first available beta version of 67 (67.0b3) and latest nightly version (69.0a1) but they didn't work either. The latest runnable version was 66.0.5.
</p><p><br>
Javascript Code:
</p><p>function uploadFile(fileAsBlob)  {
</p><pre>    console.log(fileAsBlob);
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    if (xhr.upload) {
           xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
               if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
                   if (xhr.status !== 200) {
                       console.log(""Error while uploading."");
                       return;
                   }
                   console.log('Successful.');
               }
           };
           xhr.onerror = function() {
               console.log(xhr);
           };
           xhr.ontimeout = function() {
               console.log(xhr);
           };
           xhr.open(""POST"", 'myEndpoint123', true);
           xhr.setRequestHeader(""X_FILENAME"", ""myFile.xxx"");
           xhr.send(fileAsBlob);
    }

Then, in an attempt to fix the issue I disconnected my Firefox account from the Android device and then reconnected that account and tried to re-sync.

I have verified that if I bookmark something on Firefox for Android and then trigger a sync, I do in-fact see that bookmark in the MacOS Firefox after a sync there.

Then, when I upgraded automatically to Version 67.0 on May 21, 2019, suddenly all the links I click on in pidgin open in a new private window without log in information, cookies, etc. Firefox used to say I needed to create an account to move my bookmarks and stuff, which I ignored.
</p><p>My question is, how do I get pidgin links to open in my current non private firefox window like it used to before Version 67.0? It seems opening any links outside of firefox is causing new private windows to open instead of using the existing window like it used to.

</p><p>Since the upgrade to Firefox 67, I have a problem with the homepage. 
I have a specific url as a homepage and when I launch Firefox, I sometimes have the homepage displayed and sometimes a blank page - it's random -. 
I did:
refresh firefox, 
delete firefox or .mozilla folder - /home/...../.mozilla/firefox - and restart 
or remove/purge firefox with the command line and reinstall it, 
</p><p>It does not help. 
I can launch Firefox and the homepage is displayed and 1min. later, I close it and relaunch and I have a blank page. 
I can say that most of the time (let's say 80%) if my internet connection is bad, the homepage will not be displayed, 
but.... 
if I click on the firefox home page button (even with a bad internet connection), the homepage will be displayed. 
but it also happens with a good internet connection. 
Any idea ?
Thanks.

Feedback is - in summary - that some of the file names used in firefox\ storage\default have recently become quite long and are at risk of affecting personal backup routines (they did affect my backup routines)
More detail
For several years I’ve been running backup every night without problems.  Recently – over perhaps the last couple of months – the files in firefox\ storage\default, together with my backup path details, give path lengths that exceeded the Windows 10 limit and give errors in my backup.  I don’t use the default location for firefox files.  I've solved this by shortening the paths to my firefox file location.
I've attached examples, showing path lengths, of files in firefox\ storage\default at my shortened firefox file location (showing path lengths).

I have an issue where, basically what happens is that I drag a tab from one monitor to the other. The tab correctly expands once I release the mouse, but the thumbnail persists. After that, the only solution is to restart the computer. Shutting down the Firefox process tree does nothing; restarting explorer.exe to redraw the Desktop does nothing. That thumbnail is a persistent little bugger, and it overlays itself on top of every other window as well, making it quite bothersome.

</p><p>If you take that long word put in a .html, and render, for me shows small gaps after groups of 9, 14, 18, 20... characters. The number of characters may change in different tags, like tables or a div, but always show small gaps. Tested in chromiun, but just works fine, without this gaps.
</p><p>In online text editor does not show, but when rendered is shows.
</p><p>Another detail, you need a css to force the word to break. And when this lines are created by the brake is when the gaps are visible. The css code used in that flow:
</p><p><br>
tag {
word-break: break-word;     //1 For chromiun
word-wrap: break-word;      //2 For chromiun
overflow-wrap: anywhere;   //3 For Firefox
