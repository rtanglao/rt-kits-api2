</p><p>More info local news tend to have lots of ads I use ABP (ad block plus) but sometimes they have so many scripts that seems they enter in loop, but Firefox should limit the consume of the resources .
Another info this is not nothing I see this problem  for at least 4 years , I expect that Firefox Quantum solve the problem, now that I use 66.0.3 without any legacy plugin this still happens or it is worst .

La pregunta es porque ha desaparecido en el navegador firefox la opción de busqueda de imagen por tamaño exacto que aparecía en ""buscar imagenes de google""?
Antes en firefox, cuando buscabas una imagen en google debajo del cuadro de busqueda había una serie de botones, que ahora siguen todos ahí excepto uno, el boton herramientas. Al pulsar sobre él aparecía el submenú de búsquedas en el que estaba la opción de búsqueda de imagen por ""tamaño exacto"".
Firefox este submenú ahora lo muestra en la parte izquierda, pero ha desaparecido la búsqueda por tamaño exacto (que sin embargo sigue presente en Chrome). ¿Por qué?
Llevo usando desde siempre firefox, pero mi trabajo implica buscar muchas imágenes y sin duda ""ésta, era la opción más útil"", y no me gustaría tener que cambiar de navegador a estas alturas.
</p><p>Un saludo

1257508,2019-04-28 21:26:39 UTC,2019-04-30T20:32:34Z,Double NAT causing intermitant problems browsing,"<p>Hi folks.
</p><p>This is a bit of a doozy, and I accept:  it is most likely of my making.
</p><p>Initial investigations say it is because of ""DOUBLE NAT"", but something tells me otherwise.
</p><p>Here is the ""problem"" as it presents itself.
</p><p>I go to a web site:  (eg)
<a href=""http://www.sydneycomedyfest.com.au/events"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sydneycomedyfest.com.au/events</a>
</p><p>It loads.   (But there is a catch to that.  See later.)
You see a menu bar with  HOME    SHOWS     VENUES     SHOWCASE TOUR     FAQS   ABOUT......
I click on VENUES and I am ""blocked"" from that site.
</p><p>However!   If I open a PRIVATE window and go to that site:  it loads.
</p><p><br>
Quick clarification of the bigger picture:
(This is day 3 on the time line)
Day 1.   I have ADSL internet and all is sweet.   The afore mentioned sites work and load no problems.  I'll call it a modem, but it has 4 ethernet ports too.
</p><p>Day 2.   I connect to a new system here called ""the NBN"".   I am given a MODEM (one ethernet port only) and an ISP router which has a couple of nice functions/features.   It has 4 ethernet ports and a bit more.
I know this part isn't helping, but it is interesting to learn what is going on.
For now I am plugging my OLD/ORIGINAL ADSL modem's WAN port into the new ISP router ethernet port.  All SORT OF works.
I was getting a fair bit of ""I can't load this page"" errors from FireFox OR I was redirected to the NEW router log in page.
The next day, most of the problems had gone away.   Pages loaded ok.    WEIRD!
But, as my luck has it:  I spoke too soon and I found this problem.
</p><p>Day 3.   Hi.
The problem is as stated.
If I click on the VENUES, I get redirected to the NEW ROUTER log in page.   Be it I open the link or ""open in new tab"" it.
BUT!   If I open the initial link in a PRIVATE window and click VENUES, it opens.   (Or I copy the link and paste it in the private window.)
</p><p>It seems like a FF caching problem.   Sure, I kind of get it, and accept the problem as given.
What I am wanting to understand is what is really going on.
</p><p>Given the cache ""stores data locally"", if I go back to the site, it loads the cache rather than from the site.
Which makes sense in one way but no another.
1 - cache has the pages.   they have been visited before DAY 2.
I go to the pages/URL, and the cached data is displayed.
2 - it is day 2.  I go the the page/URL.   The data is in the cache.   Why is it I am now redirected to the new router log in page?   that is counter intuitive to what the cache is there for.
Then, the next physical day, those pages work.
</p><p>Today:  Day 3, I am trying to load another link which I have previously been to and it should be cached.
Yet, when I go to it - in NORMAL MODE - it redirects me to the new router log in page.
If I open it from a PRIVATE window, it works.
</p><p>Someone - please?
</p><p>If you have read this far:
FF 66.0.3 64 bit.
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
(Oh, that's already there.)   See what the system guessed.  It is correct.

This used to work for me since the redesign to make it a ""task manager"" but stopped doing so at some point. Initially when I noticed it no longer working, Ubuntu had updated the Firefox but I had not restarted it since (Ubuntu has an update mechanism different from the Firefox built-in updater where Firefox is not restarted automatically after a new version is installed). But after a restart the situation did not reverse to healthy. 
Unfortunately I don't recall exactly which update broke it, 65 or somewhere around that I assume.
Is this an issue observed by others too? 
Could it be related to the number of open tabs (I have almost 1200 tabs spread across 9 windows open at the moment, of course not all tabs have been visited since the last Firefox restart)?

This allows me to download and install the add-on, however I lose all my personalized settings and have to reconfigure them.  This occurs when I try to add any add-on or extension.

(e.g. CloudFlare Inc ECC CA-2 and Microsoft IT TLS CA 4) resulting in not being able to visit certain websites,"<p>Apparently FF ""forgot"" some root CAs. So when a website uses HSTS I cannot visit it anymore. Examples I found more or less by chance are <a href=""http://patreon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">patreon.com</a> (Cloudflare CA) and <a href=""http://microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">microsoft.com</a> (MS CA). For both I get the ""SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER"" error. The error message tells me that it is probably not a problem I can resolve myself but I doubt that, if rather well known websites like the examples listed above wer not accessible for several days the internet would have produced a shitstorm already.
I already looked around the support website and found <a href=""http://mzl.la/1M2JxD0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mzl.la/1M2JxD0</a> which did not provide any helpful information.
I also tried to open both examples on MS Edge (because it was the easiest solution to use the preinstalled browser) and both worked fine so it does not seem to be a OS (Windows 10 64 bit) issue.
</p><p>I also found the wiki <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/AddRootToFirefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/AddRootToFirefox</a> and I was slightly suprised that I have neither of the two directories where the root certificates are supposed to be saved.

Either way, I don't get signed in.
I have disabled a VPN, cleared cookies, closed all other windows and tried a few other things but still can't get the system to finish signing me in. FWIW, that password is different than the one for M.support here. 
I would appreciate any suggestions about what to do or check to get this to work.

There will usually be a couple of options, one of which is ""I agree.""  I usually ignore the message, or if there is an ""X"" in the banner or box, I will clik on it - but I never clik ""I agree.""  So I have two questions:
</p><p>1.  If a person cliks the ""I agree"" button, does that create a situation where the site is able to over-ride one's privacy settings for cookies, or must the user do that manually?                 ...
</p><p>2.  If a person simply ignores the message, and continues perusing the website, does the statement alone (the ""warning"") indicate that somehow, cookies WILL be set if you continue regardless whether you clik something like ""I agree"" or simply close the banner or box?

(Skip to bottom part for recent event)
</p><p>Ubuntu 18.04 as far as I know up to date with updates.   2019 04 24.
</p><p>Originally I would load FF and ""restore previous session"".
</p><p>The sessions would load - granted slowly, but they would load.
</p><p>Beyond that, nothing has changed, other than now when I load FF, it just sits there.
</p><p>It won't start loading pages.
</p><p>How I make it load pages is click a couple of other tabs and try to invoke them to load.
</p><p>After a while it finally starts loading.
</p><p>Using another browser, though not restoring a previous session, the ""blank page"" loads and I can go to pages and they load there and then.
</p><p>I really don't want to lose all the tabs.
</p><p>The plugins have been installed before the problem happened.
</p><p>Last thing:
(Probably nothing, but I want to declare it here now as this is about the time this problem started happening.)
I am about to connect to a new type of service being rolled out here.   NBN.
That means new modem and connection style.
</p><p>I bought a new modem.  Linksys 1900 ACS.
</p><p>My network is STATIC IP - mostly.
</p><p>I wanted to ste up the new modem before the ""cut over"" so it can go smoother.
As I didn't know the IP address, I changed/edited the OS network type.
From Fixed IP to DHCP.
</p><p>Rebooted and loaded another browser (only to keep the old session in FF) and set up the modem.
All done.
Reset the IP settings and all back to normal.
</p><p>Loaded FF as per normal.
The problem then manifested itself.
</p><p>But as said:  Other browsers load and I can surf there and then.
Load FF and it just ""stalls"" loading any page.
I can't open a new tab, or much else for a while.

</p><p>Places.sqlite database is sane, as is favicons.sqlite db. Profiles shows Default profile: yes, and both root profile and local profile use the same file. My previous posted Q's lead me to believe you will now ask me to delve into something with the .json files.

This is will only serve to discourage me from doing an update while I'm using the browser. Now it says that I could have restored the session but as you tell by the little purple mask in the top right corner of the image I've uploaded- I was using the browser in Private-mode so that won't happen and I will get a ""Firefox is having trouble restoring your tabs"" message if I did a reboot. I had typed whole bunch of stuff in one tab and I had ended up loosing that because I couldn't open a link in a new tab (using Ctrl+left-Click). Now even if a person isn't in Private-mode there are still plenty of reasons for not doing a reboot right after an update like it's possible that a person has to wait for internet access forcing a reboot like this will only make people curse the developers. In my case obviously I was in a private session and I wanted to finish working on something before doing a reboot and in the mean time I should be able to use the browser normally like would be able to use it if I hadn't done an update. <strong>In short people shouldn't be prevented from opening a link in new tab just because they've updated the browser.</strong> That should go without saying.

Unfortunately I was forced off the ""path of righteousness"" by 57/Quantum, because I heavily rely on TMP's ability to manage groups of tabs and windows, at least for my main daily.

</p><p>I've been following TMP's efforts to convert from XUL to WebExtensions with increasing dismay. I appreciate the difficulty of Gary's task, and that the majority of TMP users are more focused on tab-display functionality, so I can see why SM seems to be down the priority list. That being said, SM is what most matters to me, so I'd like to know (in order of importance to me, decreasing):

But nothing works at all.
</p><p>What i want is to whitelist 8-10 websites for example youtube and twitch.
I have put <a href=""https://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com</a>
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com</a> 
<a href=""https://www.twitch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.com</a>
<a href=""http://www.twitch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitch.com</a>
Added http (without the S) after a wihle if that was rthe issue but no also tried using * (wildcard) but get invalid hostname if i put * anywhere.
</p><p>The auto mute is always on and require a mouse click or CTRL+M to play audio on all youtube/twitch pages even the homepage as in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a> is muted.
</p><p>Since that did not work at all i started trying to disable auto mute completely but no luck there either.
That works the same as if auto mute is on as in always auto mutes all tabs.
</p><p><br>
What have i tried?
1, The above tried whitelisting.
2, Tried changing Block websites from automatically playing sound (as in untick the option)
3, Tried changing browser.tabs.showAudioPlayingIcon from true too false (yes restarted firefox and also tried computer restart).
1-3 did not work at all all tabs always auto mute.
</p><p>4, Tried all possible combinations on the 9 preference in about:config when searching for autop.
Did nothing about the auto mute always muting all tabs.
BUT did change how auto play behaves and i have it like i want it no autoplay before i open the tab (media.autoplay.enabled.user-gestures-needed and media.block-autoplay-until-in-foreground set to true)
</p><p>5, Started firefox with addons disabled.
6, Deleted all history/coockies/and so on.
7, Tried a completely new FF profile using firefox.exe -P (naturally i thought about this after the history/cookie wipe :( )
8, Tried FF on my htpc (that did not have FF installed before so first install on that OS) running win 8,1 (this is win10).
5-8 did not work at all.
</p><p>The one thing left i could try (that i know of now) is try on a ubuntu WM that is on my unraid NAS but since i´m running a parity check (slow cpu that is 100% all the time from the parity check) on that right now that have days left too finish that WM takes 5-10min to just open FF that needs updating (both FF and ubuntu).
So that would probably takle hours and delay the parity check some too so nothing i feel like doing now.
</p><p><br>
So how the **** do you ACTUALLY disable auto mute OR better ACTUALLY whitelist sites/domains???
And again auto PLAY works as i expect and want auto MUTE ALWAYS mute all tabs regardless if withelist is used or it is supposed to be turned off completely.
It is driving me insane to have too unmute every damn tab  want unmuted on every damn Firefox startup and every damn tab i open that i want audio from.
Yes forgot that all tabs i have unmuted is muted again after a firefox restart.
</p><p>Also the mute/unmute icon is pretty annoying on 7 of my tabs that i have pinned since it so easy to click the mute/unmute icon instead of switching to the tab :=(

This behaviour started with Quantum I believe.

</p><p>For almost a year mow I'm sticking to none quantum ver of FF thx to the fact it doesn't work with the addons I want and because nobody updated them, FF also removed them from the addon page so now I must hold to them as if it's my life, they were literally the only reason I moved to FF more than half decade ago from browsers such as IE (And also since I hate Chrome), sure FF is a great browser  and my main one as for today but these add-ons save me so much of a work that they are just not wroth to give up on (too bad their creators had abandoned them and that no one made something identical..)
</p><p>So out of depression I want to have two FF versions without losing all of the addons I have on the old one, my question is how I do it and where are all of my settings and addons are so I can backup them in case I'll need to format (I already backup all of the Mozilla and FF folders that are in appdata and C drive so I assume that's was all...), I also want to know if both FF will overwrite each other and if it's possible to stop them?
</p><p>Thx
(Also if there's a place where I request from the community to make a addon for FF or teach me how so I can make similar one to the addons I use, please tell me where)

Is this general or only Windows 7,"<p>Until new version of Avast released (V.730.1270.87) and auto-installed on my Windows 7 PC I was happily using Avast secure Browser . Now with its new technicolored icon instead of the old ships wheel icon it only loads a blank window with X etc in top right corner. Great icon but.... I tried all the recommended things (double click, turn PC off &amp; on, uninstall, new download and reinstall etc). About impossible to make contact with AVAST since they class the Browser as a free product. I checked one of the Avast forums and found several others have posted same problem with the latest April 2019 release of Avast.
</p><p>So today I moved to Firefox and installed latest version of Firefox to be my main browser. Good reputation for privacy etc.
</p><p>""Hooray - Avast secure browser with bank mode etc included as a Firefox add-on. This will get me back on track surely the Avast version with Firefox will work"". 
</p><p>But alas no can do. The Firefox add-on produced exactly the same blank screens as the free Avast Secure Browser download and the version included in paid up Avast.
</p><p>I think the Avast company needs to fix the problem &amp; maybe the Modzilla group can get some action from them.  I recommend you remove the Avast add-ons option from Firefox until the problem is fixed by Avast OR AT LEAST include a warning  about versions of Windows etc that may not support newest version of Avast on-line security and its add-on version with Firefox.

</p><p>A little background info on what we're dealing with here. I work in a store and we own two workstations. Each workstation shares our two printers. One is a Star Receipt printer, the other is a Brother full size paper printer. Now Workstation2 is working without issue. We are able to print with the system specific default printer settings and nothing changes between printer. All good to go.
</p><p>Now the issues stems from Workstation1. Our Star Receipt printer is set to print '77MMXRECEIPT', however when we select the Brother printer from the drop down menu then switch back to the Star Receipt the default paper size is forced to 'Letter' which causes the Receipt to print like a large sheet of paper which means we only get a portion of what we are printing.
</p><p>This wouldn't normally be a problem, but due to some undefined steps(I'm not the only user and we don't always print from one website) the Brother printer is changed to default in Firefox which means that when we select the Receipt printer for printing, the default is again set to 'Letter' until we go to File&gt;Print and set it to default again with '77MMXRECEIPT'.
</p><p>Here's what I've done to test where the issue is this. I've changed and confirmed that when the Receipt printer is forced to 'Letter', the windows printer settings for both printers does stay on the default settings. I've also confirmed that the printer settings work on all browsers but Firefox and within Firefox I have gone into the .js settings file and deleted anything mentioned as 'print_' as well as going to Help&gt;Troubleshoot&gt;Refresh and completely setting all settings to default with nothing changing. I've also gone into About:config and tried resetting the default printer to no avail. The setting is always forcefully changed to 'Letter' when first switched to Brother printer and back to Star Receipt printer.
</p><p>My take on it is there is some saved cache or settings file that has recorded and saved the Brother settings along with the Star Receipt settings and sets them both when switched to Brother. I've attempted to check both workstations and compare settings, everything appears the same. I have no idea where else to go on this as I don't know Firefox that intimately. Short of reinstalling Firefox I've done all I can think of. 
</p><p>My current version of Firefox is 66.0.3 (64-bit) labelled as Firefox Quantum.

I've read through as many online Firefox support articles, reset the printer setting, reset Firefox, etc. but when doing print preview and then PDF print of pages, Firefox either only shows the upper part or breaks the web page into multiple pages and misses/deletes the content between pages.

One of the first is to customize the toolbar so I can get text instead of icons.  My brain works better with words than pictures... I'm constantly trying to guess what the icons are supposed to do.   It seems like such a simple option to have text but I've not been able to find it.   Am I missing it somewhere?

If FF would be so kind as to STOP being the bully in town ande conform to the same settings all other browsers use for playing Netflix video, this would be greatly appreciated. Meantime, instead of changing my Windows 10 settings to make FF happy over ALL OTHER BROWSERS, I will instead simply stop using , and convert solely to Chrome., If, in future, any of you scratch your heads and wonder why everyone fell away from FF remember these events.

But for every minute or so of playing, the audio and video fall about 1 second out of sync (usually, audio ahead of video...but not always...).  If I hit pause and then resume play, everything is back in sync but will slowly fall away.
Videos play fine in standard desktop viewers (e.g., .MOV, .MPG etc), so I don't think it's a windows problem per se.
I've gone through all the suggestions in the first two pages of Google results, and gone through all the basic stuff within the FF forums.  No change.  But, I may well have missed something.

I actually broke my previous keyboard because of this issue. I was trying to type a word with the letter Q. It would not appear, I thought there is something wrong with the keyboard (maybe dust or something). So I took out the key and never was able to put it back the way it was. Now I got a new keyboard and it happens again. Only the letter Q, only in firefox, only in some search field boxxes (for example not the search field on this website, but on google yes) &gt; See added screenshot to explain. I can type the 'q' in the website url field, but not in the google search field. So weird! In edge or chrome it works fine. So it must be a firefox problem right?

</p><p>How is it possible that after two years such a crucial functionality - UI to assigning custom keyboard shortcuts - is still NOT implemented to Firefox Quantum? With the introduction of Firefox Quantum the Mozilla team ditched thousands of useful extensions - in order to get a clean start. The Mozilla team did this deep cut deliberately. I understand the reasons. However, as a consequence, you than have to build-in such core functionalities to Firefox Quantum. 
</p><p>It is just super odd that a super niche market browser, Vivaldi, delivers this functionality built-in to their browser for years now, and the Mozilla team does not even provide a road map to deliver this core functionality. I am contuniously running 4 Firefoxes in parallel for different tasks, in favor of Safari, in favor of Chrome, I have been patient, understanding that the Mozilla team needs some time to add the core functionalities to Quantum, but I start losing my patience. RELIABLE customizable shortcuts is extremely important for profressional users. Well-meant but unreliable workarounds such as Saka Key do not deliver the reliability needed by professional Firefox users. We, the professional Firefox users are RECOMMENDING Firefox to dozens, hundreds of other users. If this further should be in Mozilla's interest please start acting now. THANKS in advance.

</p><p>The problem with the silent install is that it happens, well, silently, and the only notification I get is when I open a new tab, and instead of letting me get on with the work-related search I wanted to do, Firefox puts up a rather childishly-phrased message that can be summarised as ""Firefox found and installed an update and needs to restart to finish the process.""
</p><p>This interrupts my work (it's a work PC, remember), and makes matters worse by closing Firefox and *not* restarting.  (That is, I have to launch it manually after it closes.  That's not hard, but it's not what Firefox promised me would happen.)
</p><p>I'd like to be able to turn off the automatic installation, but leave the automatic check in place so that I can choose to launch the update when I go home / to lunch / to a meeting rather than having my working day interrupted.
</p><p>Side note: Visual Studio 2017 that I use at home manages to do this: there's a yellow flag button that tells me there are interesting notifications, including updates, and I can apply them from there when I am ready.

</p><p>Some trick if you really careful when downloading large file and failure with the same case. Make some copy or just rename the current file. When you download file with Firefox, it will create 2 files in the directory, the original filename (e.g. ""file.zip""), and partial filename (e.g. ""file.zip.part""). The file that you must backup is the partial file. After doing a backup, try to download with that different link and must be the same file. After downloading on progress, pause it and replace the current download file (partial file) with the backup file and continue the download. If not sure, copy and do not move that backup file, so you still have a backup.

</p><p><em>Look screenshot in attachment below the post...</em>
</p><p>Open other browsers: Opera, edge, chrome - the same situation like as Fireox: ""Failed to Connect"" ""https://mysite.loc "" (http<strong>s</strong> )

</p><p>Got into the Apache config. Made a copy of the virtual host with exactly the same parameters, but with a different domain «<strong>mydomain.loc</strong>» of control. Restart WAMP. Typing in FF — «<strong>mydomain.loc</strong>» (changed from «mysite.loc») - everything works!!! ?
</p><p>What needs to be done to work as before???

Really inconvenient, especially when working with forms etc. And it only happens Firefox (66.0.3), Safari doesn't show this behavior. I haven't tested in Chrome since I don't have it installed. I thought that perhaps it might have been a setting or config, so I downloaded and installed a fresh copy Nightly and the issue persists in Nightly as well.

This applies for those who have already tried these steps: 
</p><p>- If you can access the site that gives you this error in Firefox but no issues in another browser; 
- If you've cleared the cache and you still get the error;
- If you've deleted all cookies and still get the error;
- If you've tried starting Firefox in Safe Mode to temporarily disable your addons and still get the error,
</p><p>Try this:
- in the address bar type ""about:serviceworkers""; a whole list of these hidden code/cookie snippets should appear in the page. I was shocked by the shear amount of them and their privacy implications &gt;:-(
- click ""unregister"" to remove them one by one
- restart your browser.
</p><p>After restarting, the problem disappeared. In my case, a corrupted 'serviceworker' was preventing me from accessing gmail.
</p><p>Upon further reading, one learns that it's some kind of cache and that it helps accessing websites. Also, that it gets rebuilt as required. Finally, that this 'feature' can be disabled by turning the about:config value dom.serviceWorkers.enabled to false.
</p><p>Hope this helps someone, and sorry if the formatting looks awful, I have no idea why my bulleted list doesn't show as it does in the editor.

Is there a way I can annotate PDF's in Firefox similar to using Edge's ""add notes"" icon on the toolbar?
From what I've read, there isn't a native solution yet, but if you could point me to any third party extensions (I'm having trouble finding one that works) that would be very appreciated. I need at a minimum to be able to draw and highlight on the page using a stylus pen. I would use Firefox for browsing and Edge for annotating PDF's, but I frequently use Firefox's ""Take a Screenshot"" function (extremely convenient + useful) and after contacting Microsoft support I've learned there's no easy way to achieve the same in Edge.

When one allows cookies for a certain site, this site should be able to store a cookie anyway, even if one has cookies ""closed"" (not allowed). Otherwise, what's the use of the ""exception"" if you open cookies for everyone? They will all store their cookies whether they are in the ""Exceptions"" list or not.  
</p><p>Now, allowing cookies **for a single session only** can solve part the problem, since during a session there may be hundreds of cookies stored and you don't want that!! 
</p><p>If FF really wants to keep using the Exceptions list in the way it does, there should then be an additional list that will do exactly what I explained it ought to do. Which, of course is inefficient, i.e. is having two lists for the similar purpose. So, better use the Exceptions list for what it is logically expected to do.

1256384,2019-04-15 20:02:49 UTC,2019-06-26T22:04:33Z,How do I find the directory that a bookmark is in?,"<p>Having a search ""feature"" that does not immediately come up with not only the bookmark but also it's location in the bookmark folders is frankly useless. It has been driving me crazy for years, and is what eventually made me give up on Firefox. Yes I know there are extensions that can do this (though I am now a bit out of the loop and don't know of any current ones) but they are simply not the solution. Extensions change and are often disabled after an upgrade leaving me to scramble looking for yet another half assed solution.
</p><p>Imagine if the file manager on your operating system allowed you to find the words ""idiot"" in a file somewhere on your system but didn't give you any way to actually find the location of this file in your system without lots of extra work! That would be completely unacceptable - Well that is what I have with Firefox!
</p><p>As users, lazy developers of all sorts of software have tried for years to force us to store our snippets of data in one gigantic box and then force us to rely on searching, sometimes for ages to find whatever it is we put in that box.
</p><p>This is not how organized people like to work. Putting every single tool I own in a big box in my garage would be insane and using that system would be just as insane on a computer or in an application.
We generally put woodworking tools together, mechanic type tools together, measurement tools together, electronics tools together. Then when we need that funny little thing we use to pry open mobile phones, we can find it, even though we don't know its name or exactly where it is, it is with the electronics tools, we go to that box, drawer or wall-board and ah, there it is, no unpacking a huge box of unrelated tools (The thing we are looking for is always at the bottom).
</p><p>Well my bookmarks are the same. There are times when a directory system does not help and then I rely on searching but most the time my work flow is like this:
Today I am working on a robotics thing. I remember seeing a cool little motor I came across when I last worked on robotics stepper motors I remember the name of the stepper motor so I search for it. It shows me the directory I put it in and presto there too I find the information I saved about the other cool little motor. I have this happen over and over. This the only reason I save bookmarks. Hell if I am going to throw all bookmarks into a single box an use search then why bother with bookmarks at all? I can just use Google or DuckDuckGo or whatever other search engine takes my fancy!
</p><p>If there are other people out there that feel like I do, please note your irritation here so that those wonderful people who give so much of their time to improving Firefox can know that this is a big issue.
</p><p>If there is a new search tool that also shows the directory structure, please bring it to my attention.
</p><p>BTW, I am whining a lot in this post but it is because I love Firefox and really miss using it. If programming were my passion rest assured this is something I would be happy to help with but it is not, my skills lie in other areas where I regularly contribute to the good of others. Thank you Firefox developers.
</p><p>My bookmarks have become quite messy since losing the ability to easily find things and I want to bring them back into line. I miss being able to find stuff I liked.
</p><p>Oh and please don't tell me ""Tags"" - tags are another half assed solution for this workflow. Tags have their place and are useful but not for keeping things organized. They are too reliant on searching. 
</p><p>Tags: So all my tools are in one box with a sticky label tagging some as woodworking, some as metalworking, some as electronics - that is still one very big, very messy hard to work with box of garbage!

For whatever reason, whenever I try to access <a href=""http://maps.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">maps.google.com</a> it states that the website is unavailable, whereas that <a href=""http://maps.google.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">maps.google.ca</a> redirects to <a href=""http://ww1.google.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">ww1.google.ca</a> which, in turn, redirects to <a href=""http://mediadiscovery.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mediadiscovery.net</a> - which is a website blocked by my router's adblocker.
When I use Chromium or Vivaldi, I don't have that same issue, the website is completely accessible; also, if I instead use <a href=""http://www.google.com/maps"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com/maps</a> then I actually reach Google Maps from Firefox.

</p><p>This has worked well for the past few months ... and now ... after having to re-install the OS, it has not worked properly.  I noticed this on another workstation where it was flawless.  I have also noticed there are some sites where it works and more sites are becoming ""IGNORANT"".
</p><p>When asked to ""Open this site in your assigned container?"" --- NOTHING.
</p><p>This is happening on two workstations now.  It seems  I have several others to choose from to see if this is a problem.
</p><p>Right now, a Windows 8 Pro and a Windows 10 Pro workstations seem to be affected.  I have not had the opportunity to check on the Linux boxes due to a hectic schedule.  
</p><p>I have XP, Vista and Win 7 boxes also.  No, not VM machines ... regular PC boxes.  I have not had time to see what is what --- YET.
</p><p>I really want this fixed.  It is a dam good concept and in practice, it seems to work very well.  There are some things that I feel it should do to help secure privacy also.
</p><p>1)  When the container is no longer used in any Firefox window, all the cached data should be wiped.  I noticed that even though all the ""X"" containers are closed, I can still open site ""Y"" and instead of the usual verification process, it takes me right to the site.  This does not happen when I close Firefox.  I have it set to wipe all cookies, caches and temp data.  So, maybe consider when the container count goes from X to zero, wipe the data.  
</p><p>2) I have noticed when I open several sites in the same container, they do not share data.  
</p><p>For instance, Ebay - open and log on.  If I open tabs using that window, no problems.  If I open another Firefox window and try to open another Ebay tab?  Nope, it wants to log on again.  In the regular Firefox environment, it shares information, in this case the COOKIE assigned when I log on, so Ebay just goes to the page I want.
</p><p>This would really be a problem if Firefox did not remember UID and PW ... 
</p><p>3)  Remembering UID and PW does not always work for some sites.  For me, NO TWO SITES share the same UID and PW combinations.  Not even close.  So if Firefox did not remember these, I would imagine for some people that would be a real PITA.  I know it would be for me.
</p><p>I realize some sites block this useful UID/PW ""memory"" ... seems mostly financial institutions for obvious security reasons.  
</p><p>I get it - some things are not perfect.  Some little quirks are okay and we learn to deal with it.
</p><p>I have gone a bit off-subject, apologies for that.
</p><p>Anyhow, can you folks get this Multi-Container issue resolved?  My take on it is someone has figured out a way to BREAK this add-on and the code to ""DISABLE"" it is spreading like a virus.
</p><p>I would imagine a local OVERRIDE to remember the container might be in order.
</p><p>Thanks,
Eddie

</p><p>I have trouble reliably getting firefox to output surround sound in 5.1, for any format of it.  Before the last update adding the command ""--disable-audio-output-resampler"" to the shortcut worked.  Now it doesn't.  I've verified it is not a windows 10 issue, ad nauseum.  I have also noticed Chrome has the same issue, unless I cast the video I'm trying to watch, then I get whatever sound codec the video is supposed to be.
</p><p>I'm outputting from the HDMI port from an NVIDIA Geforce 1060.  Again, this is isolated to my web browsers.  Other apps, games, and tests inside windows verifies the system can output to all five speakers if told to do so.  I'm just back to the web browser seemingly resampling my audio but now I can't make it not do so.  I have gone through checking if its addons (disabling them had no effect).  I have no idea if there's some advanced setting or command I'm missing to fix this.  Does anyone have any ideas, or am I doomed to letting google have yet more control over how I use modern technology?

</p><p>When I open Firefox, I get the expected tile on my taskbar that says Firefox. Anytime I want to open an additional Firefox window instead of a new tab, I right click this tile and a small pop-up menu appears as follows:
</p><p>Open new tab
Open new window
New private window
Firefox
Unpin from taskbar
Close window
</p><p>From this menu, I select Firefox, I get a new window, and I am on my way, no problem.
</p><p>However, several months back, this menu started showing ""Firefox (2)"". I don't know what I did, but it soon turned into ""Firefox (3)"" and has stayed there. Lately, my computer has been slowing down and I'm now trying to see if this is a factor. Here's what I now always see in the pop-up menu:
</p><p>Open new tab
Open new window
New private window
Firefox (3)
Unpin from taskbar
Close window
</p><p>Even though the number is 3 in my taskbar tile menu, to open even one tab of Firefox makes Task Manager show Firefox (5). Perhaps that higher quantity had been there all along and I just never noticed. Ending task on any one or all of them makes no difference as they will re-happen when I close and reopen Firefox. Maybe this is unrelated to my ""Firefox (3)"" problem, I dunno.
</p><p>(Hovering my mouse over this Firefox tile, I see only the one thumbnail that I purposely opened so it's not like I can X out extra ones there.)
</p><p>Assuming it WAS related, I uninstalled Firefox several times, no change. I refreshed it, no change. I turned off something called e10s, still  no change to my tile menu. Somehow in all this, I finally turned off the multiple instances of Firefox in Task Manager and now only have one instance listed there PER FIREFOX WINDOW, not one for each tab contained in each window. Maybe this is the e10s thing I turned off. I'm sorry that I can't recall how I accomplished that but one must close out all tabs each time to test what changes, and I forgot to write down what I did here. It was some option I toggled in the about:config page.
</p><p>So far, I know I've done this:
browser.tabs.remote.autostart - changed from true to false. It is still false.
</p><p>In about:config:
Multiprocess windows now shows 0/2 Disabled. It started out today as 1/1 and at one point shows 2/2 (I think).
</p><p>Yet, after all of this, my taskbar tile menu still says ""Firefox (3)"".
</p><p>Can anyone who recognizes this tile menu problem help me? Perhaps along the way you can tell me whether or not the multiple instances of Task Manager has anything to do with it.

I have had various problems with using their online materials.  Most significantly: when I'm doing an exercise and/or a lengthy test, I'm given the option of ""Save"" or ""Submit"".  Sometimes when I click Save, I'm automatically logged out of the program and my responses are not saved.  Same for clicking Submit on exams.  I have resorted to taking screenshots of my responses for fear that the material will be lost with another auto logout.  I have contacted VHL Support numerous times.  Their suggested remedies: clear cache files, clear cookies, try another browser.  I've done all that.  I've also reset Firefox and uninstall/reinstall FF.  VHL states that they have no issues with my problems; the program functions normally for them.  For me, it does so ca. 80% of the time.  But in the most critical moments (like when taking a lengthy test), the program performs as I stated above.  I don't want to use Safari because I am a longtime FF user and am familiar with FF.  Some of the program glitches occurred on Safari as well.  For the last test I took a few days ago, I had to resort to using Safari and it worked.  At least when I clicked Submit, it did submit.  I'm running FF Quantum 66.0.3 (64 bit) on an iMac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4.  Any suggestions would be welcome!!

It doesn't matter if you are going to another Facebook page or anywhere else. After leaving, it freezes up, the page you are going to half loads, you can't click any of the buttons anywhere on the page or the browser (such as a bookmark or another tab). You have to close out and reopen Firefox every time. Any ideas?

I have a large number of lab devices not in DNS. As of a few weeks ago, as soon as I enter the period after the first octet it auto fills 0.0.0 after it. But it's a strange auto-fill. Instead of a suggestion (still highlighted in blue) the 0.0.0 is just filled in and whatever I continue to type just becomes a garbled combination.
For example:
I enter  https://10.  -and immediately it becomes 10.0.0.0  Any additional text then becomes like 10.2520.0.0
I've found the best thing is to continue to type the entire IP and then use the delete key to remove the 0.0.0; otherwise, it can sometimes continue to add in zeros and make a frustrating mess trying to enter the IP.
I have tried deleting history multiple times with no success.

They just don't get it, do they? 
</p><p>If I'm moving from Chrome to Firefox, I expect a one/two click transfer of my bookmarks into a bookmark bar. I expect to find a menu option that allows to import bookmarks from another browser into Firefox. And, expecting that Firefox is developed by people with IQ of at least 80, I expect them to understand that the next LOGICAL thing would be Firefox asking ""would you like to add all your imported bookmarks to your bookmark bar"" and having it done automatically so I can start using Firefox as my primary browser. 
</p><p>But I guess IQ of 80 is not something Firefox devs can brag about. There's still no intuitive, logical process of importing the bookmarks. I did import bookmarks. And they to clik to bookmarks icon, and then click again on Bookmarks to see the menu. I do have a bookmarks bar. I don't know how to just have them all moved together. I went into a bookmarks manager but imported bookmarks are not even there. 
</p><p>Ok, in my eyes now Firefox Idiocy Level just went to ""Grandoligarch"".

O Mozilla estava muito lento para inicializar as páginas, quando na data de hoje não consegui inicializar nenhuma página (o programa abre normal). Então fui atrás de uma solução nas próprias dicas do site do Mozilla, onde encontrei a dica de restaurar o firefox. Dizia que ao restaurar só ficaria salvo senhas, favoritos e outra coisa que esqueci agora. Então fiz a restauração, mas percebi que os favoritos e senhas não ficaram salvos. Tentei restaurar nos favoritos (Ctrl+Shift+B) e apareceu uma mensagem de erro. A mensagem diz: ""Não foi possível acessar o arquivo de backup"". Sem contar que a última data que aparece nessa janela para fazer o backup é a do dia 08/04/2019 (Segunda-Feira) e a restauração que eu fiz foi hoje 11/04/2019 (Quinta-Feira). Pelo que eu entendi, como a restauração foi hoje e faz um backup automático, a data que era para aparecer seria a de hoje (11/04), não? Então são essas minhas duas dúvidas. Mas a principal é a que não estou conseguindo restaurar os favoritos e nem as senhas salvas.

The only solution I have found so far is `refresh` firefox. Then I have to add my own certs again, which is somewhat tedious, but then I am asked again for client certs and it works. 
Is there a way to make Firefox ""forget"" that it got denied the previous time?  Or force rep-prompting?

</p><p><a href=""https://www.deviantart.com/smbhax/art/Visual-792896874"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.deviantart.com/smbhax/art/Visual-792896874</a>

</p><p>If you copy and paste that link off of the deviantArt page and into Firefox's navigation bar, it correctly goes to deviantArt's redirect page, and clicking the link there takes you to the specified page on <a href=""http://smbhax.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smbhax.com</a> site, <a href=""http://smbhax.com/?e=0036&amp;d=0024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smbhax.com/?e=0036&amp;d=0024</a> .
</p><p>However, if you directly click that same outgoing link in the description on <a href=""https://www.deviantart.com/smbhax/art/Visual-792896874"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.deviantart.com/smbhax/art/Visual-792896874</a> , no redirect page appears, and the browser ends up showing an incorrect, https address in the nav bar

</p><p>Firefox should not be attempting to go to the https address, as the link specified through deviantArt's redirect is an http address. I don't *think* this is an error with dA's redirect function;  as I mentioned, clicking the outgoing links goes to the http site properly in Chrome and Edge, and copying and pasting the outgoing link into Firefox's navigation bar, instead of clicking on it directly, works correctly. I contacted dA's support and they suggested it was a browser issue. However, it is possible that Chrome and Edge are invisibly redirecting the failed https request to http--although I would think that in that case they would at least prompt the user, but I really have no idea.
</p><p>I created a new Firefox profile, changed no settings, and the problem of clicking the link from dA and being taken to the https site instead of the specified http site still occurred.

I've tried reinstalling adobe flash player, resinstalling Firefox, and I can't go on to Youtube to change anything because, as I said, as soon as video starts to play (i.e. when Youtube first comes up), it freezes, so I can't access the site at all.

As it currently stands, I have three little boxes all containing the letter A.  Having an icon makes it much faster for me to find and access the website I want.

I have not a clue where to find such a URL.  I guessed at various things and they all get an error message that it's an invalid URL.  When you put a website on the Opera Speed Dial, they give you a choice of 3 or 4 icons specific to the website.  So it is possible for those icons to be automatically found, without me having to figure out where to find them.

</p><p>Not long ago my firefox on my laptop crashed and i could not get my old profile back and running again, so i decided to fully reinstall firefox from scratch on the laptop. Most of the addons and bookmarks were re-added due to the logged in profile. 
</p><p>Long story short, i want to prevent that i cannot access my profile anymore after a crash so i want to automatically backup the profile folder to a different folder (like a cloud folder for example). I have a FreeFileSync automatic backup setup but it requires to constantly run, it fills up my bin for all the files that keeps being updated by firefox and some file could not be backed up when firefox is open. 
</p><p>So i found symbolic links were you sort of make shortcuts to files and have the actual files in a different folder location. Can this be done with the firefox profile folder or will this screw up the profile?
</p><p>Alternatively if the above can't be done, is there a way to move the firefox folder to a cloud based folder (for example dropbox) without any re setting things up? So when firefox is updating files within the folder it instantly gets backed up to the cloud?

Both browsers are signed into Firefox account to sync Bookmarks and History only.  Whenever I open a new tab and attempt to directly enter any 10.x.x.x address into the address bar, whether prefaced with http://, https:// or even just the IP, autocomplete begins to display options to complete as well as a dropdown of history while the URL I'm typing highlights and that is expected.  However, once I enter the . after the first octet, the address bar immediately un-highlights and fills in 10.0.0.0 and either keeps the cursor at the beginning of the second octet or puts the cursor at the end after the 3rd octet.
</p><p>Example: I want to go to https://10.0.9.199.  I open a new tab (or start Firefox), click into the address bar, enter https://10.0. and then the address bar completes to https://10.0.0.0 and either places my cursor at the end of the URL and I have to backspace the 3rd and 4th octets and continue entering 9.199 and other times it will instead complete https://10.0.0.0 and place the cursor at the second octet where I have to delete the 3rd and 4th octets and complete typing with 9.199.  
</p><p>This is more of an annoyance than a critical bug but I thought I would report it.

</p><p>is it possible to disable F11 key for enabling disabling full screen or set it to another combination like Alt + F11?
My problem is, that i am using citrix html 5 client in firefox. Within the citrix session there is a terminal application where F11 is a special key which is needed. But unfortunatly whenever i use it also Firefox switches the full screen and then the citrix client adjusts the resolution which durates a few seconds. And thats really annoying. Using another key in the terminal application is not possible. The APplication uses F1 - F24 by double using the F1-F12 Keys.

Basically it's unable to download anything. Email attachments, files from a website. A pdf from a facebook chat log. Firefox acts just like it does when you normally go to download a file. Brief pause, some activity in the bottom left corner. Everything appears exactly right except instead of that little extra window popping up to confirm how you want to save it or where. That window never pops up and nothing happens. No files show up in my download history or default download locations.
I only use 3 add ons.  Firefox Lightbeam, Flagfox and noscript. But even if I disable all of them and restart my browser the problem persists. So basically I'm opening up other browsers and copy pasting the URL's into them to quickly download stuff because my preferred browser keeps losing the ability to download things :/ and it's annoying to keep doing the restart option and toggle the few menu settings/background I have back on.

You will hear a phrase and some time later you will hear the phrase again.  The gap appears proportional to the amount of time the HiQ video was paused.  Switch to LoQ and there is no echo/sound lag.  
</p><p>A friend who knows more about streaming than I says it seems to be playing both sound streams.  I haven't found any way to control the two sound streams independently.
</p><p>This effect is true in both Firefox and Chrome.  I work under Windows 10.  I borrowed a Macbook.  Firefox and Chrome had the same problem on it.  Safari, on the other hand, did not have the audio problem.
</p><p>Also, all of this is true if you go to our website, click the button to go to the live stream, and click in.  If, however, you go to our Facebook page, find the link there, and click in, there appears to be no sound problem.
</p><p>If anyone is interested in witnessing this, good luck, the stream only exists from 1100 AM EDT to 1200 on Sunday mornings.  Go to <a href=""http://effortchurch.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://effortchurch.org</a>.  On the first screen are 4 buttons.  The right hand one takes you to the live stream.  Click on the picture to start the stream.
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions on diagnosing this, I would appreciate hearing them.

How do I stop this?,"<p>After the latest update Firefox stores cookies and site data even in always private and the content blocking set to custom with everything set it the highest settings.
Example i can check my email at outlook com then sign out click forget, then close the browser. then open it and it loads my email account without signing in. The only way it can do that is, the browser is storing cookies and site data. the only way to prevent it from doing this is to do everything i described then open the privacy settings and clear cookies, and site data and clear history, two times.
Firefox like this is the most unsecured browser. it was a lot better before all these changes. It was a good idea, but it's caused a lot of troubles with security issues for me.

</p><p>Recently (within the last week) it started to keep the videos paused even when I switch, so I have to then manually press on  the video's play button.<br>
If I reload the page with the video that was paused this way, it becomes paused again.<br>

I use different themes for each device I run Firefox on (animated themes on my faster computer, non-animated on my slower machine).  
</p><p>As of the last update to Firefox (or possibly the one before that) my themes constantly get disabled automatically.  I am currently using Firefox Quantum 66.0.2 (64-bit).  On one machine I am running Windows 10 and another I'm running Windows 7.  
</p><p>I've been trying to determine the circumstances that cause the theme to be disabled, but I'm not certain yet.  I can close Firefox and re-open it and it still works sometimes (sometimes not).  I have seen the theme disable while I was using Firefox, as it it just switched off.  One possible cause that I am still testing out is whether it is tied to the different themes on different devices.  Both devices end up getting their theme disabled, but possibly the trigger for the disable comes when I enable a different theme on a different device.  I'll report back when I have tested more.  I specifically have turned off sync'ing settings so that I can have different themes (and home pages), and that has worked fine for quite some time.  Maybe the themes are now sync'ing regardless of this setting?
</p><p>I did see a response to this issue elsewhere, and it was mentioned that this can happen if there is a problem with the extensions.json file or the prefs.js file in the profile folder.  I don't that this is happening here because I looked at those files and don't see any problem with them (what should we look for to determine a problem with those files?).  Plus the fact that this is occurring on multiple machines makes it unlikely that they both have file corruption.

It had apps that made the browsing experience significantly better than other browsers, you had a bookmarks bar that you could not only organize your favs but add information about a site in the extended Properties dialog box, and you could quickly load any site and view any steaming vids.  Now, all browsers have apps but Firefox updates so often it forces the best apps to become nonfunctioning and many of the developers even stopped updating their apps.  As for the bookmarks bar, every browser has one now and Firefox no-longer has the extended Properties dialog box so there is nothing special there anymore.  And the streaming vids are so iffy I am typically forced to watch network channels on other browsers. Yeah, you may have a hundred methods for fixing your broke browser which I have to systematically make my way through instead of making right the first time, but I shouldn’t have to do it.  So my question is, are you going to be making a browser that is ahead of the curve again or are you still going to be putting out the status quo with every update?  Which seems to be every other week.

That is not the case. Checking options if its known in Firefox reveals it is not in the list of known extensions.
So maybe Firefox does not know what do any more. It used to open properly but that is history it seems.

</p><p>I reinstalled my OS, which wiped out the Firefox install on that hard drive. I booted up an older version of Firefox from my other hard drive (I didn't realize that the up-to-date one I was using was on my OS drive), and proceeded to update it. During that process, I logged into my account to start syncing, and in between various Firefox update-restarts, I pressed the ""Sync Now"" button which I believe overwrote my sync data. I pressed it without much thought, not realizing it was the ""Sync Now"" button (I half-thought it might open up the sync options menu or something).
</p><p>Is there any way to go back to a previous sync restore point to make sure that all my extensions, history, tabs, and bookmarks are properly saved? I do have what appears to be a mostly-up-to-date version of my session (albeit disorganized) in the form of the ""Synced Tabs"" feature -- under the name I used to use for that instance of my browser -- but I don't think all of my bookmarks synced before I overwrote it.
</p><p>In the future, what should I know about sync overwriting? If I open up Firefox on another PC device and sync my data, do I need to touch absolutely nothing to avoid overwriting it, or was the problem caused by pressing the sync button?

</p><p>Is there a way to get Firefox to recognize that it can open PHP files?  Or at least treat them as html files?  I went through the General Preferences, and even tried to change the default program to Firefox (And even tried ""automatically"" -- what a mistake!!), and kept getting the same dialog box.  checking the code in my text editor showed that it was a simple html document. I would rather not have to go through all my files and change the suffix of every document from ""php"" to ""html"".  I would think there's a better way.  Is there a viewer plugin? or would it just be a fix in General Preferences -&gt; Applications?  On my Mac, it would show the document ""type"" beside the content type, ie.  html/text.

I know they are working links because I can click them while the page is busy loading but when it is done, they are no longer accessible. I've tried using Safe Mode, restarting, refreshing, and even adjusting the performance settings but nothing works. It seems to be an issue with filtering ""mixed content"" on a particular site or at least a particular set of pages on a given site. When I do try and set the site to allow cookies or ""disable protection for now"" the options don't come up for the site. It has worked in previous versions of Firefox, so it is a little frustrating - especially if some links work on the site while others don't. I don't really want to refresh the page every time just to access the links, so any suggestions or fixes would be welcome.

Hello,
</p><p>in our organization we would like to push Firefox with GPO to users computers, but we have one problem. We have very stick security rules, so we need to block add-ons installation, and it's easy to do that using GPO. But we also using one approved add-in (Ghoster)  so problem is that I can't ""white-list"" this add-in. If I configure this setting: 
Allow add-on installs from websites, and put this URL: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery</a>. It will allow all add-ins installation from: <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> web page. Is it any way how I can block all add-ins just ""white-list"" only Ghoster, also users should be able to install it by them self.

Not all drop-down boxes are recognised on all screens.  Similarly, some drop-down boxes are recognised, but the ability to select the suggestion is limited.  These issues are not present on other browsers.  Firefox is my preferred browser and I do not want to have to use another browser simply for one program.   I am currently running Firefox Quantum 60.6.1esr and have cleared cookies and caches.  I have also confirmed via a system check within Xero that Firefox 60 is a supported browser.  I am not sure if the issue lies within Xero or within Firefox (given I have not had these issues in the past) but am hoping someone can look into the issue and provide a solution.   Warm regards and TIA - D:)

</p><p>Hi there Firefox, I've something very important to tell you. There's an ongoing Mozilla Project named Common Voice by Mozilla to collect human voices, I also contributed my voice then I went to the ""listen"" section and what I found was that many of the voices were sounding like they've been recorded by some SPEECH SYNTHESIZERS software means there are some people who're using OCR to recognize the text and then recording the voices through speech synthesizing hence they're ruining the purpose of this project and wasting millions of contribution by actual human beings. I humbly request you to please look into this matter and do the needful.

</p><p>My Question is about the configuration of an access to local files using by file protocol. In the default, accessing to local files is available. But I'm afraid about any security problems.
</p><p>So I disabled file protocol by an operation bellow.
</p><p>1.1. Displaying the detail configuration from ""about:config""
</p><p>1.2. Searching by the word ""fileuri"".
</p><p>1.3. Changing the value of ""browser.tabs.remote.separateFileUriProcess"" to false from true.
</p><p>1.4. Changing the value of  ""browser.tabs.remote.allowLinkedWebInFileUriProcess "" to false from true. 
</p><p>Then I want to ask about this operation. There are three points.
</p><p>2.1. I understood the method to disable an access to local files by using uri which's prefix is ""file://"". But It is not clear about an necessity of the operation discribed by 1.4.. From its preference name, I guesse it makes available to access to local files from links on the web. Is that right? and Is there a necessity of the operation discribed by 1.4.?
</p><p>2.2. I suppose it might be a basic matter for users of firefox. But what kind of threats  do we face in the case of being available to access to local files by using ""file://""?
</p><p>2.3. Are there any other operations we should do for security about firefox like this problem?

When I change the opening procedure to an external pdfreader - eg. xreader everything is fine.
The only way I can print in duplex, is to print the html to a file and afterwards open the file via the filebrowser. The then generated pdf file in the spool/cups directory has the producer and creator  cairo 1.15.10 which was generated by the xreader 2.0.2.

- not a fan of the scrolling mechanics (I use smoothscroll) even tried changing values in about:config but was never satisfied. It seems slow and unresponsive.
- when I launch my browser, I configured it to launch 3 tabs, but I only want to load the first (selected) tab, and wait until I select the others for them to load, I haven't found any option to do this. Also, I'd like an option to not automatically switch to new tabs when middle-clicking on a link or pressing ""open in new tab"" on a link.
- I was never a fan of the search history window, and I really think it needs an update, it looks old and I never understood why the order is so weird (not chronological). The history tab in chrome is something I miss. The downloads window is alright but could also benefit from an update.
- also, even though firefox 66 is pretty fast, it isn't as fast as I would want considering the HW I have (I5 6400 and a GTX 750 w/ 8gb of RAM), I find chrome a bit faster and more responsive, but I understand this is not something that can be fixed overnight.

But there are many timeout settings. Which settings are important for my task?

I'm curious why the ""last used"" time of some cookies seems to get updated in FFQ 65.0.1 (on linux) even though the website has not been visited for a while. It doesn't happen for all sites, but it seems that many stored cookies get their last used time updated when FF is first opened. For example, under Prefs-&gt;Privacy&amp;Security-&gt;""Manage Cookies and Site Data"" the 3 cookies stored for <a href=""http://qantas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">qantas.com</a> are marked as last used 2 hours ago (when I opened the browser) but I haven't visited the site for several days, don't have any open tabs for qantas, etc.
</p><p>I'm speculating this might be because:
1. Cookies with short expiration times are being somehow refreshed?
2. Something to do with keeping history (but note <a href=""http://qantas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">qantas.com</a> is not listed under Recently Closed Tabs or Windows or today or yesterday under History)
3. Something to do with the New Tab Tools addon (but no qantas sites appear anywhere on the newtab page)
</p><p>Current P&amp;S settings are to block trackers and cookies from unvisited websites, and not delete on close.  If anyone understands what behaviour is causing the ""last used"" time to be updated, I'd welcome an explanation of what's going on.

</p><p>We found a bandaid for the issue. It was found on what appear to be unrelated issues, but it works for the moment. We toggle the ""security.enterprise_roots.enabled"" property to ""true"" in the ""about:config"" portion of Firefox. I found a few tidbits on that property here:

</p><p>However, that article only references Root CA's that are setup on the OS, not within Firefox itself. Does this mean that a freshly installed version of Firefox no longer has a Root CA store and it can't be bothered to trust the OS's Root CA store either? If so, why? It makes the browser unusable. Predictably enough, it's all the end user's favorite browser and it performs better than the others we have available to them.
</p><p>The enterprise_roots option is a bandaid in our environment. As soon as people log out, their desktop is reset to a default state. What all is involved in fixing this so we can get business back to normal?

One URL that I had viewed in my browser everyday (a gym timetable) now automatically downloads the PDF rather than display it in the browser (which is annoying because 1) I have to navigate to my downloads to open the file instead of it being displayed instantly and 2) I have to delete the PDF every time I view it (it is changing constantly so that's why I want to open the PDF in the browser without the hassle of the download). I assumed it was a change that the website manager had made, so I initially asked that question but have not yet received a response. But now I am experiencing problems opening other PDFs - in some cases they won't open OR download at all!
</p><p>I followed one piece of forum advice which was to disable all extensions and then test to see if that fixed the problem. Unfortunately it did not. Then just now I have updated to the latest version: Firefox Quantum 66.0.2 (64-bit) thinking that that action might solve the problem. But it did not.
</p><p>I would be so grateful if anyone could shed some light on this. It is most frustrating. I have tried opening the PDFs in Chrome, for example, and they seem to display fine and as normal inside the Chrome browser window. But I want to use Firefox! Help!

</p><p>When I check under Options-&gt; Privacy &amp; Security-&gt;Logins &amp; Passwords the box to tick for ""Ask to save logins and passwords for websites"" is faded out and does not work.

There are obviously many other people with the same problem as I have seen this same issue brought up multiple times when I have researched this problem. I have looked at the answers provided in the various forums etc. and none have provided an answer that works for me. I have done the ""about:config"",   ""about:preferences#search"", gone in and deleted or inactivated all add ons, etc. and either the expected response such as looking for the ""keyword.url"" is not there or does not work. If this can't be fixed I am going to stop using Firefox all together as this Yahoo search thing is SO annoying. I would think that with this being a common problem the help sites for Mozilla/Firefox would have the answer readily available. Furthermore, just my two cents worth, but I think it stinks that either Yahoo or some other associated program hijacks the address bar and changes the search from Google, which is what I had set up, to Yahoo without a warning or even without asking if I would like this. The results that Yahoo search produces are very inadequate.
