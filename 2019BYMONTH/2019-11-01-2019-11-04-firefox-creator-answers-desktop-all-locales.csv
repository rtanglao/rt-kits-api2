</p><p>on an Apache 2.2 httpd I have configured a named virtual host like <a href=""https://example.com:4711"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com:4711</a>
</p><p>This virtual host contains 2 reverse proxies for the /i/ and /apex/ subdirectories used for Oracle Application Express.
In addition to this there is a subdirectory named /docs for some static documents which are independent from Oracle APEX.
</p><p>Within the Apache virtual host configuration the /docs directory is password-protected using the directives ""AuthType Basic"" and ""AuthName MyDir"" inside a &lt;Directory ...&gt; section - this is working fine so far.
</p><p>However, when being authenticated for the /docs directory, the credentials are also sent when requesting /apex/ or /i/ URLS - thus disturbing the Oracle APEX Authentication (which uses cookies). Doing some monitoring with Wireshark (after switching off SSL temporarily) shows that the credentials for the ""MyDir"" realm are sent in the HTTP header not only for /docs but just for every directory. After clearing the ""Active Logins"" the APEX login works fine again.
</p><p>Tested with FF 60 ESR (as well as with old FF 45.9 ESR).
</p><p>Is there any means to prevent this behaviour, i.e. that users do not have to clear ""Active Logins""?
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

I went to Time Machine and replaced current places file with older ones. Bookmarks returned but still no delete option. 3. I tried to restore bookmarks from backups. All JSON backups must be corrupted, because none will open. And the Export and Backup functions do not work either. 4. I checked Places Database to Verify Integrity. No solution there, but readout is below. 5. I tried to create a new profile, set up an account and tried to sync. No luck.

I got a message that due to changes in Firefox the Firefox profile cannot be used anymore. Then I copied the profile folder manually and checked profiles.ini, but no way. I found an Firefox help article how to copy several files manually to the new profile (""Recovering important data from an old profile""). This seems to be a workaround, but I'm not sure if it restores the Firefox profile completely, and it is unexpected additional work to complete the Windows Restore. 
So my questions: 
Is there an easier way to get the restored Firefox profile running? Firefox synchronization is not allowed due to company policies. 
What is the technical reason for not accepting copied profiles anymore? BTW, there is still an article in the Firefox help recommending this: Back up and restore information in Firefox profiles

Instead it prints the first, last, and sometimes one middle page.  The print preview function suffers the same error.  Since the problem shows up in print preview I don't believe that it is related to the configuration of a specific printer.  It doesn't seem to be a coding error in the web page as other browsers like IE, Chrome, and Opera render the page accurately.  Because I don't print pages often, I can't tell with what version the problem showed up.

Do not disturb my work.,"<p>I sync browsers between small old laptop and desktop and use a couple dozen add ons for specific purposes. Each add on when it is updated forces it's own new tab into foreground, disturbing my current work, possibly causing time sensitive entries to be lost.  The problem is worse on the smaller system due to delays as add ons update and new tab opens. These get in my way and interfere with my business. Chrome is just as bad with this. Make these add ons better behaved. Show an indicator on the three bar menu icon, which already shows permission changes. I will get to it when free.  I want to choose when to view update info, and would be happy with a short update message with links to more info. Also would like to designate time of day or weekday that<strong>bold text</strong> Add Ons are allowed to update. Or have just one tab opened in the background where all such update messages appear. Also, as add-ons come in via Sync, do not default to adding to tool bar. That shrinks my URL text box at inopportune times. Again, put it on the Overflow and I'll put it on a toolbar when and where I prefer.

</p><p>I checked the FF default profile folder and the sessionstore.js file was completely missing, and the sessionstore-backups folder only had two files (recovery.jsonlz4 &amp; recovery.baklz4) that were both only 2kb in size. I suspected these are simply the empty starting page and using a third party website to inspect the contents trhe suspicion turned out to be correct.
</p><p>So, what I'm wondering is are there any other older backup files saved anywhere in the FF folders that could be used instead? I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups. And further, is it possible to recover all those tabs and windows somehow if the only backup files are blank as I discovered? I have not closed FF after relaunching the first time after the crash in order not to create any more blank backups.

</p><p>1. I created a brand new user on the system and ran Firefox from that account.  Problem still exists.
</p><p>2. I launched Firefox from the command line in safe mode. Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ firefox -safe-mode
</pre>
<p>3. I launched Firefox with Wayland.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
</pre>
<p>4. I launched Firefox with X11.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-x11
</pre>
<p><br>
Something odd:
</p><p>The user agent string being presented by Firefox is inaccurate.  It is presenting itself as 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
</p><p>And yet this is definitely FF70 on Fedora, as I can attest to, unless I have gone insane and am not realizing it yet.   It particularly troubles me that I have to post this support request from a different browser (so disregard the auto-detected user agent associated with this post).  Oh, the humanity!

If I start FF from the dock, one window opens with one tab at the designated homepage - all good.
If I start FF from a .webloc file, I get one window as above and another separate window with a single tab showing the .webloc link.
In Mojave, only one window with the .webloc tab would open which was fine, in Catalina, I have to keep closing the unwanted second homepage window which sits behind the .webloc page.

I hope someone can help!  I've tried everything.
</p><p>I’m using a desktop; Dell; newer. Windows 10; 1903; plenty of speed and space left.
No viruses, etc.; have done many scans (malwarebytes, adware, etc.) 
</p><p>For whatever reason (I think I incorrectly shut down Firefox and/or my computer, and that was the beginning of the problem), Firefox is causing lot of issues.
</p><p>Won’t open or close. followed all the advice on this site.
</p><p>Found out on this site to try ending Firefox in task manager; when that didn’t work; went in to and deleted parent.lock from the profile.
</p><p>Then rebooted the computer; still wouldn’t open (or did once, but then had the same problem?)
Tried shutting off the computer and restarting rather than rebooting many times during all this process as well.
</p><p>I followed what someone said about adding the word OLD after places.sqlite.
So in the original profile folder I have:
</p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD
    places.sqlite-shmOLD
    places.sqlite-walOLD
</pre>
<p>that didn’t help things.
Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’
</p><p>So I have:
</p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD
      prefs-1jsOLD
      prefs-2.jsOLD
      prefs-3.jsOLD
                  Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them
</pre>
<p>That didn’t help.
</p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop.
Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it.
</p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’).
</p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile. 
Same issues.
Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again.
Rebooted.
</p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open).
</p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox).
I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; …..
</p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile!
</p><p>The ‘default-release’ profile and the brand new one I created were never changed or touched; never added the word OLD to anything in there; made no changes.
</p><p>So Firefox wouldn’t close; so I had to do all of the above again (try to end task in task manager; delete parent.lock, and reboot).
</p><p>So now I’m at my wits end!!!
</p><p>I can’t find anything left to try.  : (
</p><p>I hope someone can help!
