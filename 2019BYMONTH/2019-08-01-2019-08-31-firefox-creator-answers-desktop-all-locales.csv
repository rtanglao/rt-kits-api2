Hopefully someone can advise on this. On the website <a href=""http://Pixiv.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Pixiv.net</a> Firefox seems to have trouble loading some of the tabs when I go from image to image after opening maybe 20 or so tabs. The content on the page is gray and requires a manual refresh. This does not happen in Chrome. Not sure if someone is able to reproduce this on another computer. Screenshot attached. I have plenty of memory 16GB with an i7 Processor. On Windows 7 Ultimate.
</p><p>To reproduce, search for a tag in pixiv like car for example. Then open 20 or so tabs and sift through them. Some of the tabs content will not show anything. Pretty much occurs every time randomly.
</p><p>Edit 9/2/19: I'll keep this question up since someone may want to reference and fix it. I moved back to Chrome, there are just way too many issues with FireFox that still need to be addressed, especially the over aggressive filter modes in In Private windows. Turning them off do absolutely nothing.

Today my Firefox browser (Version 68.0.2 (64-bit), Win 10) stopped displaying all pages. The loading spinner was rotating indefinitely, and nothing happened. Safe mode did work.

</p><p>Everything worked in safe-mode, but not in the default one.
</p><p>So I backed up all my bookmarks and decided to uninstall ff. But before that I made sure that I'm signed in to FF Sync, and the tabs are synced (there is a checkbox ""Open tabs"" which was checked and is checked now).
</p><p>After reinstalling Firefox I found out that the folder called ""Old Firefox Data"" appeared. I still have it.
I signed in to sync and found zero tabs there. None. All the bookmarks are in place, the history is there, but no tabs.
</p><p>Could you please help me restore the tabs?
</p><p>Copypasting ""Old Firefox Data"" into the ""Local Directory"" (from about:profiles) didn't help.

Recently assembled a new computer, quite expensive and powerful. And there was a problem with Mozilla Firefox. No other browser has such a problem. Namely: pressing the ""scroll"" button on the mouse does not work, i.e. I cannot hold down the ""scroll"" button and move the content of the page up and down and right and left. How can you turn on this button, as it was before on another PC. This is the first problem. The second problem is that when you create a new tab or open a page in a new tab, two of these tabs are created (attached image). Two identical copies.  It's as if the mouse is double-clicking. But that's not true. I checked in other browsers. The mouse is new and working. I also checked with all the disabled add-ons. Help me solve these problems.  Thank you.

I found my way into a place on FF where I was able to 'forget' a website which seemed to fix the <a href=""http://vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vegas.com</a> site. However after trying to make a reservation on the site later in the evening the same problem appeared. Pick travel date particulars and the site skips over what should be the next twp steps (booking the hotel &amp; flights) No amount of cookie and or history clearing seems to make the site work again. Seems to me that the security built in to FF is a tad too strict or something and keeps sites from loading correctly, Redbox still will not remember my log-in credentials from step to step while trying to rent movies on line. Anyone else have some suggestions? Disabling all Tracker / Ad  Blockers does not seem to help either.
</p><p>As before, these problems do not occur if I use MS Edge.
</p><p>Since my move to a new PC running Windows 10 64 bit and with the latest version of FF a couple of websites that I frequent no longer work. They will work in MS Edge, but not Firefox. These two websites are <a href=""http://Redbox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Redbox.com</a> and <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a> For Redbox their system can not seem to retain my login information during a session. Each thing I try to do asks me to reenter my log-in info. Can no longer rent movies. For <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a>, if I try to look at Air/Hotel packages the website always skips the pick a hotel and pick a flight steps and goes right to the option to pick a show to see. Again, this does not happen if I use MS Edge. What could be going wrong with FF new attention to privacy and security that is breaking these sites. I have shut off Content Blocking on both of these sites already.

Things then run routinely for a few hours or a day, before the whole routine starts over again.

</p><p>I'm using Quantum 68.0.2 with the Google homepage as my start page.  In recent weeks Firefox has begun to save my search history across multiple sessions (image 1), without any settings having been altered.  This is alarming, as not only have I instructed Firefox not to save search history (image 2) and disabled history in Sync settings (image 3), but as you see I've also set it to clear history when closing, which of late seems to do nothing.  Even after clearing history manually, searches I've made days ago still pop up in my Google suggestions after restarting the browser.  Everything you see in purple is stuff I searched for last Friday, and even had the computer shut off over the weekend.
</p><p>This happens even if I restart Firefox with all add-ons disabled.  I've trawled the forums looking for a solution, but everything I've found is pretty old &amp; involves ""about:config"" parameters that no longer apply as of quite a few versions ago.
</p><p>Notice I have Google search suggestions turned on (image 4), but from my understanding this is separate from saving history, and should merely suggest frequently searched keywords.  Of note is that the history in image 1 does not show up if searching Google from the address bar.

Firefox is almost getting useless due to this blocking,"<p>Firefox is far too extreme in blocking access to websites preventing me from browsing for ""connection"" and ""security certificate"" so-called ""issues/errors"".  It almost regularly attempts to block me from accessing websites such as, for example, CNN (!!)  for security certificate issues, and in many cases absolutely will not allow me to browse to some websites.  This gets to the point where I have to switch to a different browser to visit websites I have been using for &gt;&gt;decades&lt;&lt;.  How can I **completely** shut off ALL Firefox security monitoring to allow ME to decide what I want to view? 
</p><pre>Just FYI, I have NO PROBLEM with websites tracking my visits, I actually prefer that.  As well, I have NEVER seen any problems with security certificates endangering me at any of the websites I view, whether the website's certificate is current or not.  I am quite capable of judging for myself whether a website poses any danger to my PC, and I have an AV utility that does an excellent job of protecting my PC, I do NOT need any help from Firefox. I never visit websites that would even remotely present a danger to my system, I am not into games, dark web idiocy, or any other such dangerous sites and I know what to look for to decide the reliability of any site I visit.  I have NEVER, in over 25 years, been hacked or endangered, so I need no help from Firefox.

</p><p>If I disconnect my internet, Firefox 68 starts instantaneously.
</p><p>If internet is available, Firefox is taking 45~60 seconds to appear. Worse, while it is background-starting, it is also freezing my UI (Windows Explorer (W7-64)) during the entire time it is conducting these private transactions.
</p><p>After searching for a solution via the forum, reading the support docs for ""slow startup"" (why do they always steer me towards the ""it's not us"" solutions?), I decided to monitor FF with my TCPViewer.
</p><p>After what I found, I decided to create a Firefox account (I didn't want to), just so I could report this here, and hear what people might say about this. Is this happening to anyone else?
</p><p>TCPView showed me eight (8) local ports opened by Firefox (not a problem, part of the architecture, local is blazing fast), followed by 5 to 8 remote TCP ports-- some to a distant 443 (https, and secure), but also a few 80's (http, insecure).
</p><p>One transaction, which was repeated on two consecutive startups, was a pull of more than 550MB from a site belonging to Microsoft (per GeoIP).
</p><p>Please note that my Firefox has uBlock Origin as its only Add-On. I upgraded to 68 because 67 wouldn't stop popping the ""update available"" message, and now I've also added my own policies.json (so I am now free of the pestering). Are these factors?
</p><p>My bottom line question is, why so much remote data exchange before completing startup?

The technician put my files on a new laptop. I then downloaded Firefox onto the new laptop. I tried to login to my account, but it didn’t accept my last known password. The system forced me to create a new account and wiped out all of my information. Now that I can get into the system, I see that a recovery key can be created in case the password is forgotten. I don’t recall creating a recovery key before, but the system never asked me for one. It just made me create a whole new account and lose everything. Anyway, in the recovered data, there is a file called “Old Firefox Data” from 8/11/16 although strangely the file says last modified 4/15/17. I’m not sure what any of this means, but is there a way that I can restore at least some of my old bookmarks and information from this file?

One more like this and it will be strike 3 and I'll do whatever I can from then on to cause Firefox and its developers to wish they had not screwed up a browser that was working just fine.

In a non-persistent VDI environment, on occasion we have users that experience the dreaded ""Couldn't load XPCOM"" popup error message.

We are a VMware View shop using instant clones with what's called a ""Writable Volume"" which is, in essence, a file system filter that allows certain user data to be written to persistent storage and the rest is written to the non-persistent VM. Upon logout the persistent disk is detached and the non-persistent VM is removed/rebuilt.

Currently, to my limited knowledge, if a particular entry in the browsing-history is deleted, then all instances of that web-page are deleted from history ; e.g. if I visited a certain web-page of YouTube on 1st Jan, then again on 20th Jan, and then on 30th Mar, but wished to remove the last entry - I would right-click that entry in the ""Library window"" and select ""delete"" and that would result in all of the three visits getting wiped out. I am sure the features of ""most recent visit"" &amp; ""number of visits"" are useful for many but like I explained before, combining all entries in one creates a bigger problem of hampering the flow of recording one's activities (even if it helps reduce RAM usage). 
Currently, this is one of the main problems that I face while using Firefox (for over a year) and always forces me to go back to Chrome (where extensions exist to properly manage history, but are not available for Firefox because of fundamental differences in both programs, while the current Firefox add-ons regarding history are all useless).              
If anyone could properly guide me out of this problem, I would be grateful. Thanks in advance.

How do I change it to show the Print button like the older versions did?  (I have been all through the preferences and about:config files, but i can't seem to find the right thing to change.).

I use Altiris (Symantec Management Agent) to deploy Firefox. I keep having a problem where Altiris will have the updated version of Firefox, and then a minor update to Firefox is released and it breaks Firefox.  Like right now we have 68.0.1 packaged, and 68.0.2 just came out and Firefox automatically updates to that. Firefox won't work when Altiris installs 68.0.1 because of the detection check looking to see if Firefox 68.0.1 is installed, but it doesn't so it installs 68.0.1. Firefox then says that I'm using an old version and need to make a new profile and I lose my bookmarks, internet history, and logins. We would like to prevent this from happening.

Having spoken to the credit card issuers, it looks like Firefox blocks the outgoing request for authentication since neither MasterCard nor Visa had any record of a transaction being attempted or authentication being requested. Consequently, the authentication window stays open for ever with nothing happening. I have already alerted my MasterCard issuer, a major retail business, in the hope that their complaint to Mozilla will carry more weight than mine. In the meantime, I wonder if anybody knows of a tweak or change of settings that may resolve this problem until Mozilla role out a fix.

Problem I have just started getting is that the newly created window loses the Menu Bar etc, all the way down to the Bookmarks Toolbar.  This includes the 3 items in the top right corner - ""Minimize"", ""Size"", and ""Close (X)"".
Only way to close the window is to go to the Windows 10 taskbar and select the window to close it from there.  A screen shot is attached.
....
I suspect this problem is related - on the primary window, the work ""File"" is blacked out ... looks like a depressed black section of the menu bar.  If you look hard enough you can sometimes see the last 5th of the letter ""e"".  This occurs whether the window is sized or maximized.  A screenshot is attached for this also.

Its as though FF realizes that it has an instance open in full screen mode and that's why it opens the next instance in non-maximized mode. I am hoping someone can tell me how to have the second instance override this behavior so it will open maximized on monitor2 like it always does. Thanks.

1266862,2019-08-16 19:35:03 UTC,2019-10-30T23:04:08Z,Need help on reducing bookmarks line spacing,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>First of all, I would like to say that I am a Firefox user since 2007 (since we are in 2019, that's 12 years).
I like it and I thank all the Firefox people that worked on it.
</p><p>However, about two weeks ago I have updated my system from Debian 8 to Debian 10; and with it came a new version of Firefox.
</p><p>And I don't like the way this new Firefox version looks:
- it's ugly 
- it has out of proportion line spacing in the bookmarks
- it has out of proportion line spacing in the Preferences menus
- it is much less visual appealing than previous versions
</p><p>Nevertheless, under the hood, I don't doubt that it is more advanced and better.
</p><p>I just think it's a wrong move from the people leading Firefox at the moment.
Maybe they believe they have to follow the (stupid) trend that many other software houses are following: 
- non intuitive icons
- poor use of colors
- exagerated simplifying in icons design
- minimalistic screen organization
- menus with less options, forcing the users to edit configuration files
</p><p>All this leads to the user having to ""try and guess"", trying to discover how things work.
20 or 10 years ago, the softwares weren't so advanced, but they were more organized and with better menus.
Today, if seems the need is to build something beautiful.
But that beauty soon loses it charm after 5 minutes of interaction.
</p><p>This is the sensation I get from interacting with Firefox nowadays.
And it extends to the support forum, with lack of tast in the design, colors, etc.
Too many steps back, in my opinion.
</p><p>Using Firefox now is not as good an experience like it was some years ago.
We need something that works, that has good menus, that we like to see.
And not being forced to like something that others think it's the present trend.
Firefox is used for the internet, so it needs to be a very good tool.
Stop fooling around with it, please.
</p><p>Also, when I try to solve this problem using themes, I'm stumped because I find some many themes.
But the problem is that they are poor quality themes.
Much quantity, but poor quality.
And the search function, is horrible to say the least.
</p><p>Besides, I don't understand that Firefox now calls themes to simply adding an image to the menu bar.
Is that really a theme?
Is this really a good service?
I don't think so.
I think this is dumb.
And steers users away.
</p><p>I don't care for flowers or manga characters in my menu bar.
I just want well designed folder icons and line spacing that makes sense.
</p><p>Why doesn't Firefox gives the user the choice of using the previous themes?
Aren't we in 2019?
Something like: Menu - Tools - Themes:
- Firefox 55 theme
- Firefox 56 theme
- Firefox 57 theme
[..]
- Firefox xx theme
</p><p>Can you imagine how many hours are you wasting from your millions of users that use Firefox to work and would benefit of something like this?
</p>
<h6 id=""w_"">================================================</h6>
<p>Having said this, now I present my goal with this post:
I would like to know:
- how can I reduce bookmarks line spacing?
</p><p>I use Firefox to work everyday.
I need it to be functional.
I have thousands of bookmarks and I have organized them so they fit my screen.
</p><p>Right now, I am losing much time scrolling up and down within my bookmark folders, because this new version of Firefox has a bigger line spacing than the version I used before.
</p><p>Please see the attached picture.
</p><p>Thank you.

They are different subject versions, not copies  or editions of each other. Depending on which version I am using at the time, Firefox would routinely backup either version, and it can be seen in the Profile. Either version is also visible as a function of time and size, if I want to restore them. When I manually back either version up I do so to a separate folder in ""documents"". There has been no problems for over two years until today. I backed up Version A at 10:00 manually and Firefox also shows one at 10:06. Normal. At 10:15 I restored version B which naturally overwrites version A. Worked fine, as it has in the past. I edited version B using Firefox ""show all bookmarks"". On finishing I selected backup&gt;chose file&gt; version B and nothing happened. So I tried export to HTML with file name - nothing happened. I selected a book mark to open in new tab and it worked. I tried to delete the bookmark, and it would not delete. I can see that my account is synching and has been for about two hours.  This practice of alternating bookmarks version has worked without a hitch for a very long time.   
</p><p>I am concerned that if I exit FireFox the effort to edit the version B bookmarks will be lost because it is not in profile folder and not able to manually back up. Suggestions?

</p><p>This question has to do with the VERY poorly written v68.0.2 update.
</p><p>If you read my prior post, address above, I MUST KEEP V56.0.2 ALIVE IN ORDER TO SAVE REPETITIVE CONSECUTIVE SCREEN PRINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTLY - v68.0.1 HAD NO CAPABILITY OF DOING THAT, AND NEITHER DOES V68.0.2 APPARENTLY.
</p><p>FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF SEVERAL CONTRIBUTORS - I WAS TOLD THAT I JUST NEEDED TO INSTALL v68+ IN A DIRECTORY OTHER THAN ""Mozilla Firefox"" SUCH AS ""Mozilla Firefox - NEW"", IN THE C:\Program Files DIRECTORY.
</p><p>I HAD v56.0.2 RUNNING ON ANOTHER TASK, OPENED V 68.0.1, WHICH DEMANDED AN UPDATE - IT COULD NOT EVEN TELL THAT THE MESSAGE CAME FROM 68.0.1, INSTEAD IT UPDATED THAT TO 68.0.2, BUT IT ALSO TRASHED MY INSTALLATION OF 56.0.2
</p><p>WHILE EXECUTING THIS HORRIBLE UPDATE, IT DID NOT ASK WHICH DIRECTORY TO INSTALL IT IN - IT JUST PLOWED AHEAD AND DESTROYED MY V56.0.2 INSTALLATION, AS WELL AS MY ACCESS TO THE ONLY USABLE SCREEN CAPTURE ADD-ONS - SINCE V57+ DESTROYED THOSE.
</p><p>THE FACT THAT NOW EVEN UPDATES ARE SO POORLY WRITTEN, IT APPEARS THAT THE END OF THE ROAD IS AHEAD FOR MOZILLA.

Unfortunately, I am finding that the scroll bar is always ending up at the bottom when I click to move to the next page. The reason this is happening is that when I click to navigate to the next page from the previous page, I have to scroll all the way to the bottom in order to click to get to the Concur Expense Reporting page, so the scroll bar isn't smart enough to go all the way back up when it's on the Concur Expense Reporting page.  Any way to fix this?  Thanks in advance!

</p><p>Épp most frissült a Firefox 68.0.2-re (Win 10 Pro x64-en). És nem tudok vele képeket lementeni. Kétféle jelenség van:
</p><p>- megnyitok egy png vagy más formátumú képet (az url-ben látom a kiterjesztést), de jobbklikkes mentéskor a Firefox webp formátumú fájlt hoz létre. Hiába írom át a kiterjesztést, semmi sem nyitja meg a letöltött képet (hibaüzenet: nem megfelelő formátum). A webp formátumot sem (PS CC 19.1.2 és ACDSee van kéznél). A mentett kép ikonja a standard png, jpg, stb. ikon, nem a képfájl tartalma jelenik meg.
- ugyanez úgy is fennáll, ha a képet direkt (listából választva) png (stb.) formátumban mentem. A mentett fájl png vagy jpg kiterjesztéssel kerül a desktopra, de nem olvasható.
</p><p>Követtem cor-el segítségét ebben a thread-ben:

</p><p>Iskolai tananyagok összeállításához kellene képeket mentenem, ez nem szokott copyright problémákat felvetni. Ma legalább 20 képpel próbálkoztam, tegnap délután még minden OK volt.
</p><p>Tudtok valami megoldást?

My address bar in Firefox54 shows lots of options.  They disappeared when I upgraded.

Next line:  address bar  search bar pocket googleoptions home ......
Next line:  bookmarks
Next line: Prefbar
Bottom line:  open tabs
</p><p>Firefox68:
Top line: old style menu (File, Edit, View, ...)
Next Line: address bar &amp; search bar and that silly 3bars to show the menu.  (everything else has disappeared)
Next Line: bookmarks  (all OK)
</p><p>That's it. Even when I load multiple tabs, all I see is a tab that ""floats"" over the address bar &amp; if I open multiple tabs, they seem to partially ""hide"" behind the menu area so I can vaguely see them behind the bookmarks &amp; address bar - which is very disconcerting

<p>Hello.
I have a problem logging in to my Firefox Sync account.
I've set up 2-step login before.
When logging in, a 6-digit code from the authentication application is
required. Unfortunately, there is still information that the code you
entered is incorrect.
I have changed the password, but the error with the code still appears.
Unfortunately, after changing the computer, I do not have a recovery key.
Is it possible to delete my account so that I can create it again?
I have already accepted the loss of data, but I care about the address
to be synchronized.
Greetings.

After doing this a couple of times, I get dumped back to where I was, on the merchant website offering me ways of paying, including of course PayPal. I've tried searching through past posts, but they all refer to what's obviously a previous version of FireFox - eg suggesting I click on an Advanced tab that isn't there

1266673,2019-08-14 01:24:51 UTC,2019-08-14T22:21:20Z,Poor multi-tab user responsivness is caused by primitive FF multi-tasking/ threading.,"<p>Could this note be referred please, to the FF programming manager?  First my congrats on FF overall of course, to you and your many volunteers.  But I notice a large philosophical programming problem which you might consider.
</p><p>This problem mostly shows with multiple tabs open.  Web servers certainly are slow, and many pages' Html etc poor.  This all results in lots of delays such as reported during:
</p><pre> Waiting for ()
 Read ()
 Transferring data from ()
 Performing a TLS handshake to ()
 Connecting to ()
</pre>
<p>These display the moving ""working"" dot in the left of the affected tab title.  And less often, ""(not responding)"" in FF's title bar, which eventually gets cleared automatically.
</p><p>I have reviewed all 17 screens, and a number of the individual results, from today's FF forum search of:
</p><pre>  169 results for (not responding) for Firefox
</pre>
<p>None address the lack of prioritized co-operative multi-tasking/ threading, DURING such delays as ""Waiting for ()"".  During such a necessary wait, it is very slow at best, e.g. for a user to switch tabs.  Even to one which is ready for display.
</p><p>Responsiveness to user input should be the top multi-tasking priority.  Tab switching.  Rendering/ display of the foreground tab.  Scrolling that down.  Tab closing by user!, and ""X"" to STOP a page from loading -- give those user clicks priority.  Let's not have to wait 10 seconds for a right-click to open its option box.  Let the other busy tabs finish up their work, overlapped in the background priority-wise.
</p><p>This could be done now, but perhaps it would be difficult for volunteer programmers.  Worse case might require a custom replacement, for the effective TCP part of the default vanilla TCP/IP stack.  However I suspect a lot could be fixed short of that, with the correct management encouragement and guidelines.  At least if the continuous motion of the ""busy dot"" indicator in the tab title is a task, just change that to something like just gray-ed out while busy.
</p><p>My experience is with much headroom:  CPU (50%), memory, disk, and network bandwidth, per Task Manager.  NO McAfee.  Mainly just ZoneAlarm taking 30% of that CPU 50% usage.  This is not a problem with start-up delay.  And delays within only one open tab are necessary, of course.  Cheers

1266664,2019-08-13 22:00:47 UTC,2019-08-16T20:11:22Z,Updated via PortableApps to ver 68 and all of sudden Now have an enterprise policy applied.  How-to can I disable the policy for My Personal FireFox ? ?,"<p>I usually use and update my PortableApps version of FireFox, that runs from my Thumb/Flash drive, at the Public Library network's workstation due to my use of their facilities for research.  
The Library uses this same version of FireFox on each of their workstation, too.  About three weeks ago, PortableApps indicated that FireFox had an Update to version 68 ready for my copy of FireFox to use.  I accepted to update My Personal copy of FireFox to this version while using the Library's workstation running Windows 7.  
Now when I startup my personal copy of FFox from my PortableApps Flash drive, I immediately noticed that INSTEAD of showing the Home page that I had chosen many years ago and was still using, it had changed to the Library's selected Starting Webpage, as if I was starting FFox or Chrome from THEIR installed software ON this workstation (please see -- the attachment showing the Grayed-out selection about the Home Page).  
I have contacted PortableApps via IRC and they confirmed that they do not effect the installation of FFox other than install upon the logically identified drive as the target device.  They felt that there was some background process running and this process might have applied an Enterprise Policy file to this installation process.  They then suggested contacting Mozilla's support. 
I would like to properly address this change and also see what other preferences may have been affected.  I have posted this Question due to having been hurt by using a Generic solution (in the Past) described for a similar but not the same issue (i.e. How to Disable the Enterprise Roots Preference).  
Reading a bit further, there seems to be two methods of accomplishing this type of control (MS's - Group Policy -or- a policy.json file).  
In the meantime, I thought that I would seek Mozilla's Support more specific advise and help.  
I find this VERY annoying considering, I am using my personal version of software and they Only recently ( after using their network for years ) affected my copy without ANY notice posted on their network of this type of change for my consideration.  
My benefit to the use of a my personal copy is to be able to save found sites to My - Bookmarks/Favorites.  Otherwise I would not have this ability, but with notices, I would have found either other public networks or methods to have this functionality years ago. 
</p><p>I hope that someone may have a better process of figuring out how and what to do to in these types of situations.  Also what would be the best way to protect an otherwise operating Browser - Say backing up, What ! ? Prior to making changes ?  Thanks ahead of time !

I also use Cookie 5 for management of cookies and noticed it was not deleting Firefox cookies, but still worked with other browsers. I worked with <a href=""http://sweetpproductions.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sweetpproductions.com</a> to see if Cookie 5 had an issue but nothing found. Essentially, if I wipe out Firefox entirely ( I went as far as creating a new Firefox Sync account) things work for a while. Problems start to show up in this order:
1. No suggestions from my history when typing in the address bar
2. Old bookmarks show up, ones that have not existed in the new Sync account (I did, however restore my bookmarks from a clone of my SSD made a couple of weeks ago, so they may have been somewhere in there)
3. Cannot delete these old bookmarks
4. Export bookmarks to html creates a file with only folder titles, no links at all (I tried this to see if I could edit out the unwanted bookmarks there and re-import)
5. Export bookmarks to html fails altogether; no file is written
6. Cookie stops being able to read and delete Firefox cookies. The new cookies arrive, can be seen in my Privacy prefs, but don't show in Cookie 5.
</p><p>Most of this sounds like places.sqlite is becoming corrupted. I don't think that is affected by Cookie 5, as I understand it stores only history and bookmarks. I'm waiting to hear from SweetP to confirm Cookie 5 doesn't touch places.sqlite. I suppose I must try to confirm this by starting over again and keeping a copy of places.sqlite when it is fresh, then using it to replace the file in my profile when the problems start.

</p><p>It starts with Firefox preventing Macbook Pro from shutting down (OS 10.11.6 - late 2011 model).
It won't force quit
I have cleared the library and the cache.
I have uninstalled and removed the whole Firefox folder from Library/APplication Support.
The macbook then shuts down properly.
I have re-installed firefox.  
BUT without even opening Firefox just putting it in the applications folder, the mac now won't shutdown - the desktop and top menu bar disappear and the wallpaper just hangs.
I have run Malwarebytes to see if I have some malware issue - but it's come up clean.

This issue started a month or two ago. Previously, Firefox takes about 1 second to start. The next day, starting my computer, Firefox consistently takes about 5-10 seconds to start. Not only this, but it also takes 5-10 seconds for an already running Firefox to respond to links from external programs (e.g. Adobe Acrobat, Word), as well as opening a second Firefox window by clicking on the Firefox shortcut. Interestingly, everything is fast and smooth with normal browsing and opening a new window via Firefox Ctrl+N is fine. Other browsers and software have no issues (e.g. Chrome). This has been really frustrating as I'm heavily reliant on Firefox and I have tried the following methods to no avail:
</p><p>• Disabling all add-ons / Start Firefox in Safe Mode
• Reinstalling Firefox with fresh / no profiles.
• Disabling anti-virus software (ESET Internet Security)
• Uninstalling anti-virus software
• Flushing DNS and resetting adapter
• [WORKED] Starting Windows in Safe Mode
• Disabling start-up services and processes systematically without Windows Safe Mode [Firefox slow again]
• Disabling all services [still slow]
• [WORKED for a few days...] Clean reinstalling WINDOWS
• [WORKED for a few days...] System Restore (in between restore points I did almost nothing to PC, did not install any new programs, etc.)
</p><p>Sounds like a software issue, but if you want specs:
Intel 7700K, 16GB 3000MHz RAM, Z270, Nvidia 980 Ti, Crucial M500 SSD.
</p><p>What are your thoughts? To me, it seems like something that run in normal Windows mode is slowing Firefox to start. Possibly conflicting apps? But I couldn't figure out which. Obviously, I can't run Windows in Safe mode all the time, so I was wondering if you have a solution?
</p><p>Many thanks
Cam

</p><p>I only reboot the PC about once a week, and my wireless Chromebook worked OK accessing weatherbug. 
</p><p>The first thing I did was to clear Firefox’s cache &amp; cookies. That let weatherbug’s first page load, but I could not navigate, &amp; clicking on its different options just gave a spinning circle. Closing &amp; reopening Firefox gave the 502 Bad Gateway message again. IOW clearing cache &amp; cookies was good for a one time only first page load of weatherbug. All following attempts gave the 502 message.
</p><p>I rebooted the modem &amp; router but that made no difference. I didn’t expect it to because the Chromebook worked, but I figured why not give it a try anyway.
</p><p>I then rebooted the PC and that solved the problem.

</p><p>This error began after my PC suffered a significant error that crashed out most active programs, including Firefox; attempting to start Firefox again caused the relatively common ""Firefox is already running but is not responding. The old process must be closed to open a new window"" error to pop p, with the options ""Close Process"" and ""Cancel"". Clicking either button caused the error message to become unresponsive, and after a few minutes a second identical error would pop up (without the original one ever closing); sometimes when there were several unresponsive errors it would sometimes crash Windows Explorer if I tried to interact with new popups. In Task manager there were multiple Firefox processes running, but attempting to ""End Process"" would not end two of them, they simply stayed there active. By this point I'd resolved all other issues from the PC crash, as far as I could see, and no other programs were showing any issues at all.
</p><p>I restarted the PC several times but the error persisted; I was able to create a new profile in Profile Manager but this did not stop the error. I uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted the parent.lock files in the Appdata/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles folder (they were 'in use by Firefox' if I didn't uninstall and restart the PC first, even though no Firefox processes were listed as running in Task Manager). I then reinstalled Firefox, but I still got the same error popup (though it at least didn't become unresponsive and crash Windows Explorer any more - but I still have the un-ending processes in Task Manager).
</p><p>By this point I've (after backing them up!) uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Roaming folder, everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Local folder, and under Program Files (X86), then reinstalled Firefox again. The error persists, unchanged.
</p><p>Any further suggestions on what I could try would be welcome, I'm stumped by this. Chrome and Avast Browser work fine; Internet Explorer works about as well as it ever does. No new programs had been installed around the time of the problem (to my knowledge) and I've been using Firefox for years on this PC.

When I come back to the facobook page, and it starts to zoom in and out violently, the macbook processor starts to blow hard, because of the increased processor load.

No beep. No Cap. 
I thought something went wrong during the install, so I did it again.
It still didn't work.
I, avtually, had to do another full reset because, believe it or not, a wireless keyboard did something to my PC. 
After wiping everything, yet again, and after installing Firefox, the Shift Sticky Key doesn't work in the browser.
Is it Windows or the Browser?
Well, it works in Edge. And for some reason, only Edge.
So, what happened?
Why has the Shift Sticky Key been disabled?

</p><p>Therefore I was wondering whether if the website server supplies the full cert chain file to Firefox whether Firefox will use that to 'bypass' the lack of trust of the SpaceSSL certificate or whether the same trust issues will remain (since SpaceSSL CA is not in the trusted store of FF).

What/where is the Customize Palette window?  So I guess what I am saying is that although I have been using firefox for many years now, I usually go with the defaults and so I don't get into the Tools are much.  I may need a little more direction.

New problem, when I launch FF, there's a 10 sec delay to get to my homepage, google.  Wasn't like that before.  So, I disabled my vpn, and that fixed it. VPN didn't have any effect , good or bad, on 67.  
I tried edge, and it's fine, only FF 68 has the startup problem.  So, uninstalled 68, clean installed 67 to get rid of vpn effect.  Now it upgraded me to 68 and I have no problems with startup.....
The choppy sound problem is back.  Choppy when launching or going from page to page, but not while just reading an article.

I am not sure if this is a Google of a Firefox problem. In this past week there has been a new information frame appear. Before when one clicked on an image it would be highlighted amid the search grid with some associated information (original site, image size etc). Now this pops out as a separate panel to the right of my browser screem. Due to the quick way I need to work, this is cumbersome and annoying.
</p><p>Also if I right clicked and opened an image in a new tab, it would open with the image filling two-thirds of the screen on the left, which gave a decent view of it. On the right hand panel would be the information about site, title, caption etc. Now all of this is squished into a portrait sized panel that looks as though it has been designed for a tablet or phone. It also means with each image I am having to conduct an additional action to right click to expand to full size so I can actually get a decent view of what it is because it has been so squished down to only medium size by all the other data.
</p><p>My question is this. Up until a few days ago this panel was not there. It would occasionally appear sometimes, especially if I was logged into a Google account but mostly not and would be gone next time I searched. From my investigation of this it is something that appears with some browsers and not others. If this is something that does/doesn't appear in Firefox, how do i make it go away?
</p><p>My question is is how do I make this pop-up panel go away and just get the regular old image highlight? Much easier and less messing around to use, not to mention actually offered a better and clearer view of what the image actually was.

My tabs that usually automatically restored, didn't do so as usual. Didn't know if I could restore it (though knew it might be possible), but I was too busy at the time to learn it. Just had to accept it was gone to get done with my tasks the coming weeks. 
Sorry, long story. 
The problem: It happened again now, but I succesfully restored the session from sessionstore-backups with the .jsonlz4 file. 
Question is: I would like to restore last years session too. In the sessionstore-backups folder I can only find files from a month back. Is it ANY way to restore/find the URLs in the active tabs, from last year. I know it's a long shot, but it was VERY important to me! 
Thank you my fellow foxes.

I have all the dependecies installed in /home/linuxbrew/.linux and the build setting works previously with firefox 64.0. It seems the build system is looking for dependency in /usr/lib, which contains ancient version of compiler toolchain that can't build firefox. How do I tell the build system to exclude looking into /usr/lib at all?

aktuell ist mir aufgefallen das man im Firefox .lnk Dateien nicht Downloaden kann. Der Download schlägt immer Fehler. Dies wurde bereits mit mehreren Personen und Geräten getestet, allerdings tritt überrall der selbe Fehler auf.
Über einen anderen Browser besteht das Problem nicht, hier kann man ohne Probleme die Dateien Downloaden.
Ich bin verschiedene Lösungsschritte von Mozilla durchgegangen um das Problem zu beheben, allerdings war dies leider ohne Erfolg. 
Profil zurückgesetzt, Firefox neu installiert, Download Ordner geleert, Download Ordner zurückgesetzt, Cookies gelöscht usw.
Kennt vielleicht jemand das Problem ggf. hat jemand einen Tipp wie man das Problem beheben kann?
Über eine Antwort würde ich mich sehr freuen.
LG Alex

When the user then attempts to use the 'Attach to Email' function in Acrobat, it returns the error ""the file ""[location of users Outlook .OST file]"" is in use and cannot be accessed. Close any application that is using this file, and then try again. You might need to restart the computer.
</p><p>The issue does not present itself if the .PDF file, downloaded via Firefox is opened from the 'File Explorer' download folder. (EG by clicking the corresponding  'folder' icon next to the download, then opening the .PDF file from there or by any other means of accessing the file in question through File Explorer)
</p><p>There are also no issues downloading .PDF files and attaching them in the same manner, using other browsers or their versions of the download manager. (IE, Edge, Chrome)
</p><p>This issue has appeared on two computers tested so far and is repeatable/persistent.
</p><p>I suspect that the message regarding the .OST file is a bit of a red herring. I think the FF downloads library window is somehow locking the PDF opened through it and thus causing an error when attempting to pass the file over to Outlook to send as an attachment.

I went back to IE9. Yes 9, as Microsoft couldn't repair Windows 7 to get a later version installed. Anyhow, after my motherboard became erratic and the replacement meant Win 7 no longer worked at all, I decided it was time to 'upgrade' to Win 10. After a complete reinstall of my software from scratch I realised just how bad Edge is and thought I might see how Firefox was holding up. I thought the sync could be useful and was getting on with it until 68.0.1!
Since updating to this version automatically (the settings in options still do not work), it appears it is updating/resetting itself after every reboot. It restores the defaults and behaves as if it has just updated each time. Also after doing this for five times it appears to have broken ADBlock which advises it cannot work any more. I have had to uninstall it to get the tab to stop.
So, as my questions were never answered previously, I'll ask again:
1. How do I get Firefox to stop updating itself? Options 'check for updates but let you choose when to install them' clearly still doesn't work as it updates regardless.
2. How do I get to keep my preferences. Having to go through them all each time Firefox updates is a pain. Surely it cannot be too much to create an ini file?
3. How do I convince Firefox not to keep installing version 68.0.1 over itself?
4. As Adblock no longer works in this version (I'm sure they are pleased with this result), what good alternatives are there?

It of course suggests I log in from a familiar device or browser. So my question is, having updated it a few days ago and importing my old profile... is there any way to to roll back or get whatever it is firefox has that gmail would recognize my old browser as the usual? Its all quite embarrassing being locked out of my old gmail. If its impossible to do anything from the firefox end then thats that. Thanks.

I cannot update Firefox.  I cannot get any Mozilla approved add-ons to download.   I have tried to connect to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> using all of the Big Three browsers out there and I have the same problem of not being able to connect to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> or any of Mozilla's affiliated websites on any of the browsers.  I am using Windows 10 and currently have the Firefox 68.0.1build.  I have separately ran three different top-tier antivirus programs on my desktop PC and nothing noteworthy was found.  I completely uninstalled the antivirus programs and still no connection to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a>. I tried DNS flush and tried a different DNS server, I tried resetting the modem and router, checked the PC's date and time settings, ensured that no parental controls were enabled, ensured that JavaScript was enabled, removed all Firefox extensions, restarted Firefox in safe mode, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and still have the same problem.  I tried connecting to <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> with a free online proxy VPN and was finally successful although Mozilla's GUI didn't completely load correctly.  I am able to quickly and efficiently connect to every other website on the web with any browser including Firefox, but none of the web browsers including Firefox will connect to any Mozilla affiliated or Mozilla extension websites on my PC.  When trying to access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website, the page buffers for several minutes and then the page display's the error code PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR.  Sometimes I get an auto-update message on my Firefox browser that states that a new version is available and so I click to download the new version and all I get is buffering and no downloading.  Then a new message appears after a few minutes stating that Firefox didn't download correctly and that I need to reinstall Firefox.  I uninstall Firefox but cannot access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website to reinstall Firefox because after clicking the link to access the Mozilla webpage there is nothing but buffer and no access.  Using the free online web based VPN I was able to reinstall Firefox, but I still have to same issues.  If I run Windows 10 in safe mode with networking I am able to access all <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> websites and install Firefox extensions.  Is there any known fix to get this issue fixed while running my PC in normal mode apart from completely uninstalling and reinstalling Windows?

It could even be after add everything, but that is not the intention. I just wanted to merge all history and favorites into one bank and remove any duplicates.
For that, I need to know the SQL commands to handle these files properly, with ""append"", ""purge"", ""index"", etc.
By not oligarching SQL, I'm looking for someone who understands more than me to give me the way.
</p><p>I am not quite sure, but it seems that the ""favicons.sqlite"" file should also be involved in the manipulations.
I saw that there are several tables of each other.
I would have to write SQL commands to split the banks by month.
</p><p>Any idea?

</p><p>Alguém aqui entende um pouco do banco de dados do Firefox?
Eu falo do banco local, padrão SQL-Lite.
É que pretendo juntar o Histórico de vários perfis diferentes numa única base de dados.
O arquivo ""places.sqlite"", que fica na pasta raiz de cada perfil deve armazenar esse histórico.
Como ""appendar"" todos os registros num único banco?
Caso haja algumas duplicidades, qual o comando SQL para removê-las?
</p><p>Tenho também instalado o SQLiteBrowser.
O que me falta é a familiaridade com a manipulação de registros nos bancos.
</p><p>Explicando melhor, eu não pretendo sobrepor arquivos em pastas. Todos os arquivos das pastas de perfil ficarão intactas. Eu não quero abrir essas tabelas no Firefox. Até poderia depois de ""appendar"" tudo, mas essa não é a intenção. Eu queria apenas juntar todos os históricos e favoritos num único banco e remover as possíveis duplicidades.
Para isso, eu preciso conhecer os comandos SQL para manipular direitinho esses arquivos, com ""append"", com ""purge"", com ""index"", etc.
Por não dominar o SQL, procuro alguém que entenda mais do que eu para me dar o caminho.
</p><p>Não estou bem certo, mas parece que o arquivo favicons.sqlite também deve ser envolvido nas manipulações.
Vi que são inúmeras as tabelas de um de outro.
Eu teria que escrever comandos SQL para dividir os bancos mês a mês.
</p><p>Alguma ideia?
</p><p><br>
Anexo à essa pergunta, envio a estrutura de tabelas de ""places.sqlite"" e de ""favicons.sqlite"":

1. Sometimes, all my tabs in Firefox just won't open or load incredibly slow. I can go open them on Chrome and they load up real quick, so it's not a website or connection issue.
2. I use a lot of different Google sites. I'm not totally sure what I did. I think I wanted Google search to be different from work related admin tasks. Anyway, if I open <a href=""http://admin.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">admin.google.com</a>, it totally freaks out. First the tab starts swapping between purple (Google Search) and orange (Work). Then it starts opening tab after tab after tab until I have to force Firefox to shut down. I guess I need to go in and edit settings for some of the containers, but I don't see how to do this?

It works fine if I just print the whole web, but if I use the print function by the Outlook web, the pop up window has all the information, but the page printed only consist of the header and footer. 
I have tried refreshing, restarting and reinstalling firefox, non of these work. I also deleted all my extensions and add ons, no luck. :(
I could work around by pressing ""save as.."" with right click, save it as a .htm file, and print it with IE, but that is too time consuming. 
Please help. Thank you

I use the technique recommended by Firefox help page and can successfully delete the bookmarks but they reappear after a few minutes. I have not synced the desktop to any other device. I have also noticed that Firefox seem to automatically saves some pages to as bookmarks. It also shuffles the bookmarks on the bookmark Toolbar. They seem to move round and get swapped by other bookmarks automatically. I just installed ""Bookmark Clean Up"" and deleted heaps of bookmarks (65) using that Add-on. A few minutes later they all returned back. What am i doing that causes this ? Its driving me up the wall. Thanks

Bookmark Clean Up
