The problem seems to build relatively soon after each restart when the HDD starts persistent activity even when nothing much being actively used.  Previously would leave system running for weeks before any signs of restart being preferable.
Thorough scans, check on drive capacity, file integrity and fragmentation levels, clearing cookies and site data, etc don't reveal anything amiss.     It could of course be unrelated to FF such as if any conflict between Bitdefender and Win10 inbuilt security though none reported.    Open tabs are typically held over a restart.  restarts can be quite slow as though some temp cache being cleared.

Since updating to 67.0 Quantum, and until last night, when I started FF, the toolbars showed up, but the main page was blank.  If I clicked on the home icon, my start page (<a href=""http://news.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">news.google.com</a>) loaded fine, and away I went. 
</p><p>Yesterday, in an attempt to fix the above, I uninstalled and reinstalled FF.  Since I did that, the following happens:
</p><pre>- Starting FF shows a completely blank page. 
- Pressing the FF icon on the taskbar so that FF minimizes and then expands shows the toolbar.
- Pressing the FF icon on the taskbar again as above loads my home page.
- At this point, I can access the settings menu, but clicking anywhere else on the page does nothing, until
- I press the FF icon on the taskbar to minimize and expand switches to whatever I've clicked on. 
</pre>
<p><br>
The same thing happens typing URLs in to the address bar. If I drag to highlight, I have to minimize/expand FF to show the highlighting; when I type in a new address, I have to minimize/expand FF to go to the new address - and I have to go through the same minimize/expand dance with the taskbar icon. 
</p><p>It's like I'm having to load individual frames of a movie, rather than the movie running smoothly.
</p><p>And, to make it even more fun, when I start with add-ons disabled, FF works fine. 
</p><p>I have uninstalled, downloaded and reinstalled multiple times, including as administrator; 
I have refreshed multiple times with no success. 
I have disabled the few addons and extensions that are installed in my FF and restarted, with no success.
I also updated my IS suite (Norton) and removed and re-added FF to my trusted list.

I'll appreciate for any help! I can tell it in more detail.

1260571,2019-05-30 09:49:00 UTC,2019-05-30T12:04:16Z,How to recover data from *memory* cache (not disk)?,"<p>My 11 year old typed in a big blog entry on Wix for a school thing and then accidentally deleted it. He's one of those kids that really has to work to write much, so he's *really* discouraged and it's worth some effort on my part to recover. Wix has no recovery tools I can find, and there is nothing in the disk cache. However when I fired up about:cache I did find several potentially interesting files in the ""memory"" section. When clicking on them, I get a page with the title ""Cache entry information"", a bunch of header info etc, and then a big chunk of what looks like hex data with checksums or something e.g:
</p><p>00000000:  1f  8b  08  00  00  00  00  00  00  03  ec  bd  db  92  1b  57  ...............W
00000010:  96  a6  f9  2a  50  5c  8c  b2  7a  18  91  7e  84  bb  73  6c  ...*P\..z..~..sl
00000020:  ac  8c  a2  a4  4c  96  e9  34  22  2b  d3  ba  2b  db  68  7e  ....L..4""+..+.h~
etc...
</p><p>To complicate matters further the machine he was on is an old unstable one, so to capture the data before it died again (and presumably wiped the memory cache), I went through the cache and saved all of the likely looking files.
</p><p>Some of them are pretty big, so I am optimistic there is something in there at least, but I can't figure out how to access them. Naively it seems like there should be some way to get FF to interpret them as arriving from a server, rather than just displaying the data as text the way it does if I load the file. I've also tried editing out the decorative HTML from the cache file I saved and making a file that looks like a server response, using only the headers &amp; pre-formatted text from the cache file, but no luck. Any advice?

This may be because I Have been wanting to do it to:
</p><p>- Open all tabs from Synced Tabs, then bookmark all tabs 
(because FF Beta for Android has no way to bookmark all tabs (that I can find))
</p><p>- Reopen tabs I had just sent to OneTab, then bookmark all tabs
</p><p>Maybe I am hitting Ctrl+Shift+D too soon after I have opened all the tabs.
I have been waiting a few seconds to see that the tabs are definitely open, but 
especially if there are a lot of tabs I want to simply save as bookmarks, and get on with something else,
I don't want to have to wait for every page to fully load - that could take ages and how will I know without eyballing everyone.  
(When I've only just sent them to OneTab, then reopened, why are they not cached but that's a different issue.)
</p><p>Recently I have been saving all bookmarks, then counting the open tabs vs the new bookmarks.
This is a dumb thing to have to do manually.
</p><p>Presumably the reason it is failing to catch all is due to them not having yet loaded fully or something.
</p><p>Ideally this can be fixed, but at least if I know what FF needs to successfully bookmark all open tabs (which it does do sometimes even before every single one has fully loaded), I can work around that functional shortcoming.
</p><p>I'm sharing data, but this has happened on another PC too - much higher spec than this one I'm using today.

I need some help.
About 15-20 days ago, I had to re-install my Windows 7 (32-bit) OS and all software including Mozilla Firefox Quantum  (32-bit). 
Since installing Mozilla Firefox Quantum 67.0 (32-bit) - when I use a ""TAB"" to listen to streaming: Live internet radio or Podcast, all is good. The problem is when I open a second ""TAB"" to surf or view info. When I start to click on anything (ex: next page), the first ""TAB"" playing the Podcast will stop playing and return to the beginning of the Podcast. This only happen when opening a second ""TAB"".
This never happen before. Can it be the new update to level ""67.0"" or a bad installation of Firefox?  Should I un-install Firefox and then re-install Firefox?

1260390,2019-05-28 18:40:10 UTC,2019-06-05T08:03:40Z,FF67 is deleting a session cookie too soon.,"<p>A new problem has occurred since updating to FF 67.0.
</p><p>My default configuration is to block all cookies. For those sites I wish to allow, I create exceptions to either Allow or Allow for Session.
</p><p>On one of the sites I use I have an exception as:
<a href=""https://CompanyName.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://CompanyName.com</a>       Allow for Session    (name changed to protect the innocent)
</p><p>There are a number of subdomains used and so all subdomain cookies are allowed for the session.
</p><p>As of FireFox 67, I could no longer log into the site. I found that it was stuck in a loop reloading the page.
</p><p>If I allowed  all cookies, then the login would work. Once logged in, I could block all cookies again and everything continued to work on the site. So it was only the process of logging in that was failing.
</p><p>First thing I did was disable all cookie related add-ons. That didn't help.
If I changed the setting for <a href=""http://CompanyName.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CompanyName.com</a> to Allow, it worked.
Next I tried setting <a href=""http://CompanyName.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CompanyName.com</a> back to Allow for Session and tried each subdomain with the Allow.
What I found was I need to change one specific subdomain to Allow, so now my exceptions list is like this:
<a href=""https://CompanyName.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://CompanyName.com</a>              Allow for Session
<a href=""https://login.CompanyName.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.CompanyName.com</a>    Allow
</p><p>So it seems as though the necessary cookie for <a href=""http://login.CompanyName.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.CompanyName.com</a> was being removed early so the log in could not be completed. Once a log in was successful, I could look at the cookies and see them for this subdomain (as well as the others). 
</p><p>I can't see anything I did wrong, so I'm thinking there may be a bug somewhere in FF67.

Teď u víkendu jsem cca 2 hodiny nebyl u počítače, vrátím se a FF po restartu, z asi 15 původně otevřených panelů obnoveny pouze dva první. Když jsem se uklidnil a zjistil, že to už neobnovím, otevřel jsem alespoň ty, u kterých jsem si pamatoval cestu. Nicméně nový start FF, zase určité panely zavřené (např. mail centrum, mail seznam). Při každém novém startu se zkrátka můžu ""těšit"", čím mě FF překvapí tentokrát.
Může mi někdo poradit, jak zajistit, aby byl FF fungující, bezchybný prohlížeč?..
Přiznám se, že kdybych neměl ve FF spoustu záložek, historii, uložená hesla, a nesynchronizoval ho s dalším počítačem, už bych se s ním asi rozloučil. Takto bych mu rád dal ještě šanci, pakliže to nebude znamenat přeinstalování na hodiny a ztrátu zmíněných dat.

Until now, once I clicked a link to a web page sent to me via E-Mail (I am using Thunderbird for mail), FF nicely opened that link in a new tab. But since the update to FF 67, clicking in a Thunderbird mail web link will not only open the link in a new FF window instead of a tab but, to make things worse, this new window will miss all the addons and plugins which my FF used to provide. This means, links from e-mails will open in a new FF window with no plugins available. Also missing are all other customizations such as bookmarks. The new window opened by clicking web links in e-mails seems to run on an empty profile.
</p><p>I used to like how FF handles Thunderbird 's e-mail links but this new behaviour makes FF almost useless to me. I am seriously thinking about downgrading to a previous version. Unfortunately, TB 67 installed even without leaving a system restore point...

However, for medical reasons, I need to have the tabs underneath the url bar. It seems that, by craning my neck to look up at the tabs, I managed to cause my neck to spasm so forcefully that I had to go to the hospital. The pain was excruciating.
</p><p>It made me smile that the doctor gave me a prescription for Firefox 56 when I left the emergency room in a neck brace, shot full of muscle relaxants, and a warning to dump Firefox Quantum unless a solution can be found.
</p><p>I did try to copy and paste chrome CSS code...but that doesn't seem to work on newer versions of Firefox. I hope someone has a solution...in the meantime, I am back to Firefox 56, which puts the tabs at, not above, eye level, without having to cram my browser down to the bottom of my iMac screen.

If I go down through the list and select one match and click on it, I can investigate the detail.   Then I want to

Sometimes it doesn't but not often.   If I have done a search on a surname, when it goes back, I will have to do 
the search all over again.  Time and resource consuming.  I tried it with Windows 10 and Edge and it works properly. Then I tried it with Google Chrome on both of my UBUNTU machines(desk and laptop) , and it works properly.

1260190,2019-05-26 13:24:56 UTC,2019-05-31T19:29:27Z,Firefox 67 breaks shared profile between Ubuntu and Windows10,"<p>Hi, 
</p><p>I use Firefox on a Windows 10/Ubuntu 18.04 dual boot system and share the profile of the Windows partition to use the same Firefox information with both installations. After upgrading the Firefox Win10 version to 67.0, I get the error message uploaded as a picture. The Ubuntu Firefox version is also 67.0, so there is no older version that modifies the profile information. 
</p><p>I found this thread 
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1259820"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1259820</a>
describing a similar question, and the chosen solution to delete the compatibility.ini from the profile folder revived the profile. However, this is not a permanent solution. Using Ubuntu Firefox after Windows Firefox is unproblematic, whereas the error reappears in Windows Firefox after using Ubuntu Firefox. I have to delete now the compatibility.ini every time I use Windows Firefox after Ubuntu Firefox, which is rather annoying. 
Obviously, the Ubuntu and the Windows version of Firefox 67 interpret this .ini file differently. Is there anything planned to synchronize both versions of Firefox 67 better? Or any other solution that solves this problem permanently? And no - I don't want to store my profile information on an external Sync server. 
Thank you for your time reading this. Any help is much appreciated.

So I deleted Firefox and reloaded it without success. I deleted the add-ons, the Cookies, Caches to no success. Finally I found that my profile could be the reason and I deleted the whole Firefox-Folder completely to start from anew. When I download the new Version comes ""either you have no profile or the use is denied"" and everything stops.
If someone starts the first time with Firefox he would not have a profile either. So how can I get back using Firefox as my browser again?

O único acesso que tenho ao Firefox agora é por uma velha versão 38.0.1 ESR, que não faz tanta confusão com os Perfis.
Eu mantinha dois Perfis no gerenciador e quando atualizei estava usando o Firefox mais novo, versão 59.01. Assim que ele concluiu a atualização, nunca mais reconheceu nenhum outro perfil do usuário, e aparecem tantas mensagens de Perfil não encontrado, e não consigo eliminá-las pelo Gerenciador de Tarefas, que elas só somem com Logoff ou Reset.

También se cerraron todas las sesiones que tenía iniciadas, incluido sync.
Lo peor ocurrió cuando volví a entrar a Sync, ya que sincronizó el teléfono (donde aparecían mis marcadores del escritorio como los tenía hasta ayer) con el escritorio, por lo que ahora tengo un montón de marcadores y datos antiquísimos (y la mayoría bastante inútiles) en ambos navegadores, y perdí muchísimos datos de suma importancia.
Por cierto, antes de sincronizar intenté descargar mis marcadores del teléfono, pero aparentemente esto no es posible (al menos no facilmente), lo que me parece una pésima decisión, sobre todo si piensan borrar los datos y no dejarnos elegir en qué sentido sincronizar.
Espero una solución pronto.

</p><p>Please note: 
1. I was using the mouse. I did not touch the keyboard.
2. I say ""... (newly) ..."" because although I`d been in Google Maps earlier, upon right-clicking the Back Button it shows the current instance of Google Maps is a new one in the History, after the game which is now the previous page. In other words I have not somehow gone back. (This counts against it being something to do with the fleeting impression I`ve gotten sometimes that the mouse is being interpreted as being in a different position than the pointer appears on the screen. In other words it`s not a case of I clicked on the game, but it got taken as a click on the Back Button, because I`ve not actually gone back).
3. This is not the first &amp; only time something like this (sudden, unrequested page loading (or, similarly, sudden unrequested tab switching)) has happened (There`s been a few occurences, but I don`t recall them in such detail).
</p><p>What`s going on?
</p><p>(It`s like sometimes the mouse has appeared to be briefly dragging an image that is from a previous page/other tab (I don`t recall exactly) not even on the current page, like there`s some invisible ghost of the previous page still on the screen or something). (Memory pointers/mapping getting mixed up?).

Where in the settings can this nonsense behavior be switched off or is it at least in the about:config? All this arrogance of telling the user ""how things should be"" is most annoying. But reason cannot be expected to come back to the ""mozilla foundation"" (ever since you got funded you are void of reality) after the addon/extension apocalypse...ever. You should scrap it all, go back to FF21 (the fastest ever browser) and start from scratch, keeping the learned lessons firmly in mind. You will die if you do not get real.

</p><p>Hello all! I'm having a strange problem after an automatic update to the newest version of Firefox on my system.  I'm running Firefox 67.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.
</p><p>Every time I try to load a webpage, the browser seems to get stuck somewhere in the process of fetching the data from the site—the page remains white and the status indicator on the bottom left is either absent or perpetually stuck on ""Waiting for &lt;host name&gt;..."" or sometimes ""Connecting to &lt;host name&gt;..."". This happens indiscriminately for new tabs and tabs that are already open but not loaded. I can load about: pages like normal, but when I go to about:addons and select ""Get Add-ons"", it's the same story—the online content never loads into the page.
</p><p>Other browsers load all web pages like normal, as does Firefox in safe mode. Since everything worked as normal in safe mode, here are some things I've tried to fix the issue, none of which have worked:
</p>
<ul><li> Disabling all extensions.
</li><li> Disabling hardware acceleration.
</li><li> Switching to the default theme and renaming my userChrome.css file to make Firefox not use it (I don't have a userContent.css).
</li><li> Disabling the JIT JavaScript compiler.
</li><li> Disabling JavaScript altogether.
</li></ul>
<p>I honestly can't think of any other reason why pages would load in safe mode but not normally. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If there's any specs, log files or command line output that I should post here just let me know.

How ever what ever i try, i get a message ""unable to dowload due to connection failure"" and tried everything, even re-installing firefox, still the same. Is there a way to dowload the fix, save in and run it as a file ?
It is pretty annoying as i can't add any add ons and don't know what to do if i can't even download the fix from the website. Any help would be appreciated. 
</p><p>Thanks, Phil.

I've done all things suggested for speeding FF but even a clean install loads pages slower than any Chrome-based browser. Both on Windows 10 as in Linux. I remember in the 3.x era FF was very fast. I really hope the FF team starts from scratch with a new, lighter version of FF. My question is why is it so slow to load pages? Even Edge is faster. It's telling when long-term FF users like me ditch it. Please, FF needs a total overhaul.

1. Disabled all add-ons, extensions, themes
2. Started FF in Safe Mode
3. Using Task Manager, ended all FF and Mozilla processes, then created an additional profile for diagnostic purposes.

Good day!
Previously, in the “search” line it was possible to read the search options offered by the browser, in the sense that when you hover the cursor over one of the suggested lines, this line was opened with full text.
Now, when I hover the cursor on the proposed line, it does not open, I do not see it completely, but I see only the initial words of this line.
How to make visible the proposed search string options when you hover over them?
Thank.

</p><p>Basically the problem is as follows:
</p><p>When extrapolating polling data from Google Forms, there is usually a little green button in the top-right corner of the ""responses"" section that sort of looks like a wrapped holiday gift. This button is what you click to pull all the Forms data submitted by respondents into a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

</p><p>Does anyone know if this update or an update on Mozilla's end has suddenly caused a comparability issue? It's been a few weeks since I've used this button so I can't pinpoint exactly when it disappeared, but it had to have been pretty recent.

</p><p>On Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), I run Firefox (64-bit) and Thunderbird (32-bit), each with two profiles.
</p><p>Until this afternoon, when Firefox updated to 67.0, clicking on a link in Thunderbird would open a new tab in the currently running instance of Firefox.  If Firefox was not running, it would open ""Profile 1.""
</p><p>Now, Thunderbird will only open links in my ""Profile 1"" Firefox.  If I have ""Profile 2"" running, Thunderbird ignores it and starts a new instance of Firefox using ""Profile 1.""  With both instances running, Thunderbird opens a new tab in the ""Profile 1"" instance.
</p><p>I updated to Thunderbird 60.7.0 (32-bit), but it did not change the behaviour.  So, this seems to be a Firefox change.  Is there a way to go back to having the running Firefox instance handle the external launch of links?
</p><p>This is the behaviour that I want: clicking on a link, anywhere, will open it in a new tab in the currently running Firefox profile, only opening the default profile if Firefox is not yet running.
</p><p>Thanks in advance!

I have not yet made the switch to Firefox 66.0.5, but I am trying to.  There are so many limitations in Quantum, and it is really hard to ignore them.  i.e. - I can't set Firefox to open the Downloads (Library) window with F3 because you can't create a shortcut for the Downloads window and you will also open up Find Again if you press F3.  But I'm trying.  And I think I am making some progress.  I had to install Linux for the first time in my life and edit the Firefox binary omni.ja.  Oh what joy!
</p><p>So anyway, I ran into a new problem.  The Downloads (Library) window.  It used to have the 'Clear Download's button on the top left side.  It's so strange to have moved it to the right side, when there is no advantage.  I mean it is actually a big disadvantage to move it to the right side, and very inconsistent.  If you click History, the search bar is flush on the right side.  If you click Bookmarks, the search bar is flush on the right side.  But if you click Downloads now, the search bar is no longer flush on the right side because of the search bar.  Not only that, but it's been a lot more intuitive, faster, and easier to click that 'Clear Downloads' button when it was on the left side.  Now, I'm always looking for it, always dragging my mouse long distances, losing more time, making more effort, experiencing more headache...
</p><p>I've been playing a lot with userChrome.css code, and I learned how to use the Browser Toolbox.  But it's not letting me see, highlight, or select any elements in the Library window.  What can I do?  I just want to move the 'Clear Downloads' button the left WHERE IS BELONGS.

</p><p>I could get nothing else to work, so I requested a reset, knowing I would loose bookmarks and passwords.  I don't know what happened after I began the reset, but I thought it was done, and I had not lost anything.  My old password worked again, so I counted myself as lucky.  
</p><p>Now I find that everytime I open FireFox that the reset screen pops up, insisting I do a reset and loose it all.  I no longer need or want a reset, but other than closing the tab, I can not turn off the reset option permanently.

Dear friends! 
I can not register the Firefox account. Upon registration, the browser tells me that my e-mail password is incorrect. But this is not true!!! 
I have made a few attempts, and each time Farofex notes that the password is wrong.
At the same time, this does not correspond to the truth because I freely use the same e-mail with the same password and I have no trouble logging into my e-mail account.

I'm on a Windows 10 64 bit computer running Firefox version 64.  A friend of mine pointed out that I wouldn't be having this problem if I bookmarked every website I wanted to go to instead of just keeping them all open all the time, and I guess she has a point, but aside from being a bit lazy, it's also about having found a particular spot within the website that I want to be able to get back to, and you can't keep bookmarking all of those.  I'd appreciate any help anyone can come up with to help me find some or all of the tabs I lost in that window.  Thank you very much for trying!

</p><p>First off, I must say that this behavior happens with both the installed and portable versions of the latest stable 32-bit Firefox: when I click on a link in, say, Thunderbird, and Firefox is not running yet, it opens a new window with no addons, as though from a new, clean profile, instead of resuming where I left off when I last closed it, as I set it to do. 
</p><p>I can't for the life of me understands why that happens. It seems as though I have two different versions of Firefox (I'm certain that's not the case...), one that I start manually when I need to browse the Web, and another one that would be triggered by third-party apps, the two not sharing the same profile, of which I'm sure I have created only one. 
</p><p>I thought it could have to do with the fact that Portable Firefox comes in a 32-bit/64-bit package, with the third-party app starting the launcher instead of the 32-bit executable, but I've now deleted the 64-bit folder in Portable Firefox altogether, so that can't be it. 
</p><p>Where does that strange behavior come from?!

Porém existem vários Certificados A1 no sistema.

O correto, em meu entendimento, seria que o navegador abrisse em primeiro lugar a janela dos Certificados e possibilitasse a escolha para só depois abrir a janela para inserção de sua senha;
Certificados A3: Como sabem esse tipo de certificado é armazenado em um cartão e depende de uma Leitora de Cartões e também de um sistema, que no meu caso é o da Serasa e tem o nome de SafeSign; No ""SafeSign"" existe uma aba para a integralização com o Firefox. Ao acionar a referida integração aquele sistema reporta que a integralização foi realizada com sucesso. Ao acessar algum site que exija Certificado Digital, clicamos no link respectivo e, simplesmente, o Certificado A3 que está na Leitora e que está ""operacional"" (podendo ser acessado com o IE e o Chrome), não é reconhecido pelo Firefox. Em seguida é aberta aquela mesma tela das senhas antecedendo à seleção dos certificados acima descrita para os certificados A1.

I don't know when it started, but in the last weeks I often have the problem that if I click the left mouse button into the scrollbar outside the slider, the slider/page moves not once but twice, as if I had clicked twice.
</p><p>Indeed, the delay before a held-down mouse button starts to auto-repeat is really small in Firefox. So if I'm not clicking very very short but just with a little delay between pressing and releasing the mouse button, it starts auto-repeating and sends at least two click events.
</p><p>Comparing this with other programs it seems not to be a GTK issue but a Firefox setting. E.g. gedit has a much longer delay before it starts auto-repeating.
</p><p>Is there a way to adjust this delay in FF? I couldn't find anything about this topic. Or could one disable auto-repeat for the scrollbar field outside the slide (but not the arrow keys)?

Problem: While you start typing, you see the text on the screen, but when you hit enter or select another position in the document, the new added text disappears.
FireFox is now running at version 66.0.5 (64 bit)

Following the advice of a Mod, I updated to Firefox 66.0.5. 
Now in my e-mail, e-mails from Nintendo don't show images at all (see screenshot).  Going through all possible official and unofficial guides, nothing helped, as most guides say click on the lock and ""disable protection for now"" button, but this new Firefox version doesn't have such options. Today I also noticed on the streaming platform Twitch, where small ""treasure chest"" images should pop up from time to time through an extension, the image was completely black (should be of a treasure chest). This bug is not present on any other updated browsers, a viewer on Chrome confirmed he sees them normally.

If I disable all add-ins and plug-ins (there are only three of them) and then restart Firefox, it does not fix the problem. However, if I open Firefox in Safe Mode, it works fine. I have an old profile which uses the same add-ins and it works fine. I have FF 66.0.5. I'm not sure if the problem was created by an update.

Here's a summary of what I've experienced:
</p><p>1. My local newspaper site (<a href=""http://thechronicleherald.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">thechronicleherald.ca</a>) will freeze up for several seconds when you click on any story before it eventually releases and works.
2. The message boards at Edmunds (<a href=""http://forums.edmunds.com"" rel=""nofollow"">forums.edmunds.com</a>) which use message board software from Vanilla, use drop-downs when composing a message to add photos, links or emoticons. These have become usually non-responsive though every now and then they work.
3. Attempting to log into my <a href=""http://homedepot.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">homedepot.ca</a> account I could not get past the sign-in screen as it returned error messages about entering a valid email address and password even though those were auto-filled, and the ""sign in"" button was unresponsive.
4. I can no longer update a previously posted review on <a href=""http://Amazon.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.ca</a> because for whatever reason it will only take me to the page where you create a new review when you click the edit function. 
</p><p>These are the ones I encountered just today. I do not like using Chrome because I have been faithful to Firefox for over a decade but this is becoming ridiculous. All of the above work fine in Chrome. Using FF 66.0.5 on latest update of Windows 10.

</p><p>ich habe das Problem, dass ich keine Ausnahmen im FF hinterlegen kann, da diese Option deaktiviert ist.
</p><p>Diese Einstellungen werden zentral in der Firma durch GPOs und die autoconfig Datei gesteuert -  jedoch ist hier das Problem, dass wir diese Option gar nicht als Richtlinie gesetzt haben.
</p><p>Hintergrund des Problems ist, dass ich bestimmte Seiten den vertrauenswürdigen Seiten hinzufügen muss (analog Trusted Sites im IE), damit meine User bestimmte Inhalte auf einer Website aufrufen können.
</p><p>Ich selbst habe mir unsere GPOs genauer angesehen und es ist keine GPO aktiv, die besagt, dass ich diese Funktion nicht nutzen kann. Auch hier habe ich bewusst zum Testen die GPO angepasst, dass die vertrauenswürdigen Seiten automatisch durch die GPO gepusht werden, was leider nicht der Fall ist.
</p><p>Ein ehemaliger Kollege hat damals auch die autoconfig datei erstellt und angepasst, in der die User gewisse Einstellungen auf den Client gepusht bekommen. Hier habe ich selbiges Problem, dass meine Tests hier erfolglos waren. Zum einen finde ich in der Doku noch im Mozilla Wiki die richige Einstellung zum setzten, dass ich Ausnahmen hinzufügen kann.
</p><p>Nachdem beide Versuche über die GPO und die autoconfig Datei leider fehl schlugen habe ich den Firefox komplett zurückgesetzt, so dass dieser mit den Standardeinstellungen kommt (ohne Autoconfig datei und GPOs). Auch hier habe ich das Problem und bin leider nun etwas ratlos und würde mich über eine Lösung sehr freuen.

Pomalu se pak načítají zpět. Když přesto pak na nějaké video kliknu, přehrávat se po chvilce začne a již není problém s žádným videem, dokud Firefox nezavřu. Po příštím spuštení se chyba opakuje. Chybu neeviduji u videí na jiných webech (čt24, youtube, ...).

Perhaps the best clue, not discussed in any help articles I've viewed so far, is that Windows 10 Settings &gt; 'Choose default applications by files type' lists only Google Chrome (my previous default browser) and Microsoft Edge - no sign of Firefox!  if I set the pdf file default to Chrome, then its coloured circular logo appears to the left hand side of all pdf files listed in any folder I've viewed so far in either PC and pdf files are displayed in Chrome; likewise with Edge, its logo appears instead and it opens and displays pdf files.

Since this issue with Firefox is creating about 50 to 100 system errors per day, I've tried to resolve it in multiple ways. Making changes in Component Services will not have any affect. Also, under Internet Options, select Advance. Under Multimedia, uncheck ""Enable alernative codecs in HTML5 media elements*   - This also has no affect.
</p><p>I understand what Quirks mode is, so I know I cannot change how developers create their web pages. Does anybody have any suggestions on what I can to do mitigate the errors in the System event log?

</p><p>I'm experiencing some troubles with browsing currently, especially with wordpress based sites. Images in carousels are showing up after a long delay, and for a half of a minute or so all I can see is a grey square instead of photos. Screenshot attached. No issues with thumbnails or icons, just with carousels and slideshows which is strange. 
Tested via Chrome (74.0.3729.131) and Safari (12.2) - everything works just fine, so it's not the connection. 
Tried to clear the FF (66.0.5) cache according the guidelines, no success. For additional info, I don't use extra plugins or ad-blockers and in a private window I get the same result. What else should I try?

1. Why did you change the name from Favorites to Bookmarks. Books and Bookmarks are not expressive of the actual technology, it is misleading and obsolete. Trying to differentiate yourself from other browsers by changing to obsolete terminology is a stupid idea. Please wise up. It just adds to confusion. 
2 Why do I need to decide where to put them. Menu/ Toolbar/ Other. It is confusing. Then I forget where they are. I want one choice. Save. If I want to sort them into different folders I can organize it myself. A toolbar might be useful, but I don't want to be forced with the decision every time I save a website. Now I have to search for my Favorites/ Bookmarks with several clicks. I want one click access. 3. The same with History. The term History infers a chronology. I want to see the chronology in one click. Showing random selection with another click needed to show the chronology is a stupid waste of another click. Whoever thought this would make things easier, made things harder for me. I swear every time I try to find my ""Bookmarks"" or History. Conclusion Simple and intuitive is better! The option to complicate things by sorting into folders is good for people who need it. One click access to Favorites and History is obviously more intuitive.

</p><pre>a few day after the last update ( 66.0.5),  my browser began to be really slow to upload web pages, to the point that even internet explorer is faster and more stable.
</pre>
<p>I've already search in their FAQ and done pretty much everything they suggest ( disable ipv 6, check firewall...) but nothing work. I've even tried the safe mode still nothing. I only don't have pluggin aside from adobe flash player ( up to date) and what mozilla put by himself ( Codec video OpenH264, and a decipher module for widevine content), beyon that i've got only Adblock plus, and avast online security.
I'm on windows 10, and when mozilla slow down to the point where he can't even go on google or youtube in less than 2mn real time i usually close the program. When i re-open after half a minute, mozilla tells me that the program is still running, and that he need to close it first. The thing is: usually the program close immediately, and when i check in my task manager i don't see firefox running after closing it. Yet it still tell me that the previous session is still running. even if i wait like a minute.
Since the FAQ doesn't help, and that it began a few days after their new version, is there a way to contact them?
I'd never though i'd see the day when IE would be better than mozilla honestly.
Regards,
A'den

</p><p>I am currently running FF 59.0.1. The reason that I am still at this level is that the last update to to this level WIPED ALL my open windows and tabs forcing me to loose MANY hours of work. Being so burned I turned off FF automatic updates.
</p><p>Now being hit with the loss of all of my add-ons due to the latest catastrophe it looks like I will have to upgrade to make them work once again. Neither the ""xpinstall.signatures.required"" hack or the now completed ""study"" did anything to fix the add-on issue.
</p><p>So now I need a way to backup my open windows and tabs before updating FF. Obviously whatever method is used MUST be restorable to the current version in the case that it is needed. 
</p><p>Thanks,
Steve

my updated Firefox (66.0.5 64 bit) can't save to external media (USB) and internal ntfs disks anymore - access denied...(Linux-Partitions work; as well as the USB-Sticks and the ""Windows""(NTFS)-Partitions via file manager). 
Changed permissions (via software-panel) are not saved.
I tried refreshing, reinstalling and other suggested solutions, nothing works.
So i plan to override/complement the prefs.js with a (at the moment non-existant) user.js in the profile folder, but
i cannot find the neccessary string to do this (i searched in about:config without success).
Maybe changing its value in about:config would be enough.

1258977,2019-05-11 10:43:17 UTC,2019-05-11T11:55:12Z,Forced To Update To Quantum - Everything I Rely On Is Broken!,"<p>I've got to ask this, but was the problem with Firefox extension a ploy to encourage/force users of legay versions of Firefox to upgrade to Quantum?
</p><p>Myself and I'm guessing many other users have kept on with pre v56.0 because it works the way some people like and everything works the way people are used to.
</p><p>I have personally used Firefox as my default browser since since it first came out years ago because it just worked the way the user wanted with it being highly customisable.
</p><p>Firefox Quantum is like a family member who has been disabled in an accident, where you still love them, but they can't do a lot of the things they used to do.
</p><p>In my short time using the abomination AKA Firefox Quantum, I have came across several, what I consider ""downgrades"".
</p><p>1. The search bar no longer works properly, where clicking the the search arrow or hitting [ENTER] does nothing when Google is the default search engine for instance.
</p><p>So, instead of hitting enter to initiate the search, the user now has to use the mouse to click on the magnigying glass icon, then select a required search engine from the drop down list.
</p><p>How is that conducive to a efficient work flow?
</p>
<hr>
<p>2. The ""Move Tab To New WIndow"" is now a sub-menu when right-clicking on a tab.
</p><p>Again, another step to get to where I want to be.
</p><p>3. Well known and well used extensions no longer supported.
</p><p>4. The crappy user interface, with it's lack contrast and low-fi appearance (specifally the bookmark folder icons).
UI elements like the ""Back"", ""Forward"", ""Home"", ""Refresh"" and ""Settings"" buttons need colour  and not the lazy, ""less is More"" approach.
</p><p>5. ""Spell Check As I Type"" also no logner wroks (typoed on purpose to check while typing this).
</p><p>I'm guessing that Firefox being primarily developed as a mobile browser with a little bit development thrown in for us dinosaurs that still use laptops and PCs , god forbid and with the push to make Firefox more ""Mobile Friendly"" and able to sync with more devices, then the OG users of Firefox will have to become the casualties of war as their beloved themes, extensions etc are relegated to history.
</p><p>Flashgot no longer works with nothing even remotely useful to replace it.
</p><p>Simple extensions like minimize to tray were so useful, but no longer supported.
</p><p>It wouldn't be so bad if these features were integrated into the browser, but nope!
</p><p>It's as if Firefox is being dumbed down in order for it to be more ""Mobile Friendly"".
</p><p>So what the alternative for users/dinosaurs like me?
</p><p>Well, personally, I'll use the older pre v56  version of Firefox and put up with the nag to update.
</p><p>Hmm, only thing is, the extensions were crippled a few days back, allowing no end of adverts and other useful features to stop working due to all my adblockers and other extensions being disabled.
</p><p>Personally, I'm inclined to believe this was a deliberate act/experiment by Mozilla to see if ""Legacy Version Users"" would finally update to the Quantum as that was fixed quickly.
</p><p>No mention of a fix for the legacy versions and I dare say this will not happen if the ""Legacy Version Users"" update and keep using Quantum stay quiet.
</p><p>There is still a lot of users around the world who need a ""Power User"" vesion of Firefox, like it was before as we are not all dumbed-down ""Generation Apple"" users who need our hands held with dumbed-down programs/applications.
</p><p>Whereas the older versions of Firefox just worked, Quantum in a work just SUCKS!
</p><p>I apologise if I come accross as inflamatory, but get fed up with ""Updates"" that reduce usability and afffect my work flow.
</p><p>It is just not efficient!

Neither could I.  Nothing I did, or the repair person did, could get FF to operate, so he reinstalled the OS only because I wanted to retrieve my bookmarks that are extremely important to me.  After spending the money, I've done everything FF says about retrieving my profile and nothing works.  If my profile isn't retrievable (my bookmarks I need), then FF should AT LEAST pay for the reinstall I did ONLY to make FF work on my computer again and retrieve my bookmarks.  If my bookmarks are retrievable, then how is it done because some of the directions I followed did absolutely nothing but undo all my settings and I had to spend more time redoing all the settings.  If they're not retrievable, I hate FF and Mozilla and will never, ever ever use anything to do with them again and discourage every person I meet from ever using them at all.

</p><p>¿Alguién sabe como solucionarlo?... a ser posible sin manipular el registro de windows.
</p><p>Adelanto que opciones que había en about.config ya no aparecen. Creo que lo he intentado todo.
</p><p>Dicho esto...
</p><p>También aprovecho la ocasión para mostrar aquí mi queja (no encontraba donde hacerlo) y a ser posible que LLEGUE A OIDOS DE LOS DESARROLLADORES de Mozilla.
</p><p>Este mensaje quizás sea yo el único o primero que lo escriba pero estoy seguro que MUCHOS pensarán lo mismo, aunque no se atrevan a dar el paso de quejarse o mostrar su disconformidad.
</p><p>¿Qué ha sido de Firefox?... ¿qué hay o que queda de ese navegador ""libre"" por el que se caracterizaba y nos ""vendían"" en el que los usuarios tenían la preferencia?... 
</p><p>Muchos usuarios migramos de otros navegadores a Firefox porque estábamos hartos de ""prohibiciones"", hartos de tener que aceptar si o si las propuestas de sus desarrolladores y ahora resulta que, de un tiempo hacia acá, Firefox se está convirtiendo en lo mismo.
</p><p>En vez de cambiar o pulir las deficiencias que arrastraba desde sus comienzos, como por ejemplo la lentitud en iniciar y en cargar las páginas respecto a otros navegadores (que, aún así con Quantum, todavía deja mucho que desear), optan por acercarse a lo que todos los usuarios hemos huido al migrar a Firefox... a la falta de libertad en poder configurar y personalizar un navegador como nos venga en gana.
</p><p>Hace dos o tres días se desactivaron las extensiones y ahora hay que actualizar si o si el navegador.
</p><p>De esto último me he dado cuenta al actualizar la versión 66.0.4 pero no le eché mucha cuenta y por lo visto viene de actualizaciones más atrás.
</p><p>Aunque se active la casilla de ""Buscar actualizaciones pero permitirle elegir instalarlas"" cuando reinicias el navegador vuelve a desactivarse y aparece activada la de ""Instalar actualizaciones automáticamente (recomendado)"".
</p><p>Parece ser que el motivo de esto es la seguridad, me parece perfecto, pero creo que NADIE va a querer infectar a conciencia su equipo... ¡¡es absurdo !!!, por lo tanto déjenme o mejor dicho ""déjennos"" tomar la decisión que queramos, no nos OBLIGUEN a tomar la que ustedes queráis y sean FIELES a lo que tanto habéis PRESUMIDO que era Firefox... un NAVEGADO LIBRE.
</p><p>Antes el que que quería actualizar automáticamente lo podía hacer y el que quería actualizar cuando le viniera en gana también, pero ahora habéis hecho que sea OBLIGATORIO... ¿no es mejor que cada cual opte por lo que quiera?... después se quejarán de que pierde protagonismo respecto a otros navegadores... si es que se lo estáis ganando a pulso... y hasta creo que, de seguir así, lo váis a conseguir.
</p><p>Ya estoy leyendo en muchos foros que hay usuarios HARTOS y que están acabando con su paciencia... y mucho están aguantando, y diciendo que si sigue así buscarán otra alternativa.
</p><p>¿Hay alguna forma de poder instalar las actualizaciones cuando uno quiera y NO cuando quiera Mozilla?... por favor agradecería que me lo dijeran y que no fuera manipulando el registro de Windows (como he leido en muchas páginas).
</p><p>Muchos usuarios (incluido yo) agradeceríamos que no se desactivara esa opción y se pueda volver a la NORMALIDAD.

</p><p>Sometime in the past 24 hours a Firefox update was (surreptitiously) installed that has now disabled five extensions I regularly use (some for work) saying they're now ""legacy"" and allowing only to ""Remove"" or ""Find Replacement.""  
</p><p>Clicking ""Find Replacement"" just takes me to the generic Mozilla add-on search (ie square one).  Searching for my ""Instapaper"" plugin finds the plugin but clicking download gives an error.  Same thing with ""Privacy Badger"" and the ""Web Developer"" app I use on a daily basis for work, plus an ePub clipping app.
</p><p>Until today Firefox was my primary browser.  But stunts like this that pull-the-rug out from under users is really, really not right.  You shouldn't disable multiple extensions that so many depend on without warning.  If extension devs need to update the platform they're using, focus on forcing them to upgrade, not on suddenly disabling multiple add-ons.
</p><p>WTF Mozilla... until today you were my #1 recommended browser.

Windows. Firefox latest. Open a page OK
Top left is left arrow
Under it is the tabs bar OK
Under it are 3 black horizontal lines and when I left mouse button click them they slide the screen accross nicely to the left and put a grey circle (filled) behind the 3 lines.
GREAT I like the wide screen and I dont like all the rubbish down the left.
My Question is HOW can I save this setup configuration.
I have spent tens of hours and no joy.
It always reverts back to dross down the left side of the screen as soon as I close the page or open another.

<p>[""navb"" puts 4 triangular navigation buttons in the left margin, a la Edward Tufte. The buttons should not appear to move if you leave the mouse alone while running down the headings.  For most major headings, the first triangle is white, pointing up, and 2 pixels wider than the black button shown, which goes to the final header.]
</p><p>This made the large triangles disappear for minor headings, without disturbing the small triangles.  No other approach I could find prevents jitter when running through a list also containing  headers with buttons like

Hi Support!
Since a few days ago, I've started having a strange issue with my Firefox not being able to browse the web, at all.

<p>Any address / URL I type into the Firefox address bar, will simply revert to 'about:blank' after several seconds of 'loading'.
When this happens there is no error or anything, simply a blank white page as if nothing happened.
This happens regardless of whether it's a Private or a regular instance.

<p>1. Deleting all Cookies, Data and History.
2. Restarting Firefox by killing all processes
3. Disabling + Removing (Uninstalling) all Firefox Extensions (Currently non are installed)
4. Making sure Windows Firewall does not block Firefox
5. Making sure COMODO Internet Security Firewall (Software) does not block Firefox.
6. Uninstalling, then re-installing Firefox (Chose option to Restore old user's configurations)
7. Restarting PC
</p>
<ol><li> Note:
</li></ol>
<p>This happens only with Firefox.
All other browsers are able to browse normally, I'm sending this report from Chrome.
If necessary I can create a video of this issue reproducing.

I am using 51.0.1.  I have disabled upgrades. I have disabled xpi checks. I have set my whitelist to ALL. I have changed the reported version in use to keep you from forcing an upgrade ...
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY CONFIGS!
</p><p>I will decide whether an extension i have used for YEARS is a problem!  I not you.
Please give me a config property for v51.0.1 that will prevent you from doing ANYTHING without my active agreement and participation.
I depend on the add-ons I have installed. I use them and they work.  This is twice you guys have screwed me in one week.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY CONFIGS!
I know I can set all Mozilla files to read-only but that requires me to cycle on and off to perform some tasks and I can just see those greedy fingers looking for a hole to meddle into
</p><p>I repeat from my last complaint:
A feature without an OFF switch is a defect.
</p><p>Please tell me how to fix this DEFECT and keep your fingers OFF of my desktop

1258700,2019-05-08 03:35:00 UTC,2019-05-08T07:07:17Z,Bookmarks suddenly got deleted and I'm wondering why,"<p>OK, I reinstalled Windows and everything else few days ago. Upon reinstalling Firefox and logging into the account, it synced and added all bookmarks, extensions, addons and options back to how they were before they got corrupted by ransomware I stupidly got (which is reason I deleted everything from my PC in the 1st place). All good. Been using Firefox for last few days, it synced few times, no issues. Not on Windows, not on Android. Great.
</p><p>But 10ish minutes ago it suddenly deleted all bookmarks I made prior to data corruption few days ago. Both from PC and the Android. While using the PC version. Just, poof, gone. As well as folder structures and separators. Restore finds nothing but default ones so that doesn't help. Thought it had ""deleted bookmarks section"" but that's apparently on Opera.
</p><p>Everything else remained the same. Options, extensions, customised layout, you name it. Except ~1000 bookmarks which I forgot to backup after successful resync because, well, there's a lot of stuff to do when you reinstall everything on main PC and neverfuckingever did I have an issue with Firefox's version of a sync.
</p><p>So, what the hell happend there? Tech-wise. I can guesstimate why it happened on PC but why on Android as well? Makes no sense to me for the latter.
</p><p>EDIT: I know about restore and how it works as well as backups which I failed to make. I know I made mistakes and well, shit happens. I'm not looking for solution to the problem (which would be nice but I doubt it exist) but an explaination on why it happend on both my devices from a technical standpoint.

Can anyone help me please?
I am trying to use  ""Messenger for Desktop"" to phone Facebook friends. I can hear them but they cannot hear me. My inbuilt-microphone is selected as default &amp; works with my Zoiper Softphone.
The suggestions here (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1228717?mobile=0&amp;fpa=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1228717?mobile=0&amp;fpa=1</a> ) do not work
One of the reasons I am always slow to update Firefox (I have 66.0.4) is that the ""help"" available always has been rendered useless by innovations.
I believe ""desktop for windows"" requested mike access once, &amp; I believe I hit ""allow"".....but there seems no way at all to verify, check, change or modify this permission!
If I hit (i) / Permissions / Cogwheel / Microphone  I simply have an empty list for sites than have already asked permission. The ""allow"" / ""deny"" options are long gone.
There is no way to ""force"" a permission or set one up.
Similarly this page (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-manage-your-camera-and-microphone-permissions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-manage-your-camera-and-microphone-permissions</a> ) has suggestions that do not work..
If I go to the website  (<a href=""https://messengerfordesktop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://messengerfordesktop.com/</a>)  A request does not pop-up as stated.
And the section on managing permissions is also outdated. When you arrive at Permissions/Microphone/Settings there is no way to INPUT a site. There is only a blank list for sites that have already asked permission.
Please can somebody tell me how to FORCE a permission?

Back then, when updating to a newer version from 54.0.1. I got the message, that some extensions like Adobe Flash / Macromedia Flash were dangerous and are permanently disabled, which made me stay on version 54.0.1.
I only use Addblock Plus to get rid of some malicious Adds (the benign Adds stay) and Norton Security to stay protected.

So, I am following up here.... (and I could post this follow up there -if you want to re-open that thread, for continuity of the issue?)
</p><p>---
</p><p>I tried your solution to update the certificate, but it did not work.
</p><p>Note, I could not figure out where to check the certificate was updated (as you posted in the screen capture of image #2).
</p><p>The first step seemed to work (clicking on your link and clicking OK on the popup to download the certificate).
</p><p>The RESET of the lastupdate value also seemed to work, and after restarting Firefox it now shows VALUE of 1557118303.
</p><p>But the adblcok plus stll not working.
</p><p>Note, I tried to download the certificate using step 1 again, and that time an ALERT said CERTIFACATE ALREADY INSTALLED...
</p><p>What can I do now?

Hi Matt, I was able to start testing in Firefox 52 ESR. When I install the hotfix extension, nothing happens, other than showing up on the Extensions panel of the Add-ons page. In the Browser Console, I see this message: TypeError: browser.experiments is undefined That means the main command of the extension doesn't run, so it's a dead end.
</p><p>Next idea:
</p><p>Overview
</p><p>(1) Install the certificate the hotfix would have installed (2) Trigger Firefox to re-verify your extensions (3) Wait until it is back to normal
</p><p>Steps
</p><p>(1) Install certificate
</p><p>I extracted the certificate from my Firefox 66 and saved it on my webserver. Obviously if you don't trust me, you should not install it.
</p><p>Two possible methods: click to download through the certificate installer, or right-click &gt; Save Link As to save a local copy and then import it.
</p><p><a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/sumo/signingca1addonsmozillaorg_20190504.crt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/sumo/signingca1addonsmozillaorg_20190504.crt</a>
</p><p>Screenshot #1 shows the download method. Don't check any of the boxes, just click OK.
</p><p>To import instead:
</p><p>Go to the Options/Preferences page, Advanced section, Certificates panel, then click Certificate Manager. Make sure the Authorities tab is selected, then click Import. Find the file you downloaded and open it, then you should get the same dialog as in Screenshot #1, don't check any of the boxes, just click OK. Then you should see the new cert in the list in the Certificate Manager, as shown in Screenshot #2.
</p><p>(2) Clear the time Firefox last re-verified
</p><p>This will set Firefox up to check much sooner than it otherwise would check.
</p><p>(A) In a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful or accepting the risk.
</p><p>(B) In the search box above the list, type or paste xpi- and pause while the list is filtered
</p><p>(C) Right-click the app.update.lastUpdateTime.xpi-signature-verification preference and click Reset on the context menu
</p><p>Screenshot #3 illustrates the expected result.
</p><p>(3) Restart Firefox
</p><p>You can exit Firefox normally, then start it up again. In my tests, it took less than 60 seconds for Firefox to verify my extensions. Screenshot #4 is ""before"" and Screenshot #5 is ""after.""
</p><p>Hopefully that will work for you.

1258414,2019-05-05 16:07:53 UTC,2019-05-05T16:35:51Z,Can it be that with regard to Bug 1549078 the Firefox-user has to have the setting app.normandy.enabled set to True?,"<p>Hi there,
</p><p>With regards to the 1549078 bug (that's the one about ""what's happening with our Add-ons""):
</p><p>1. I normally have Studies disabled so I had to enable the setting to get the “hotfix-update-xpi-signing-intermediate-bug-1548973”.  But the setting wouldn't stay put: whenever I enabled it, then closed and restarted the browser the setting was lost. About:studies didn't show any study.
2. I saw a commenter (Dave) mention app.normandy.run_interval_seconds and how he set it to 1 sec temporarily and I started remembering that I had disabled the setting altogether. After enabling normandy and setting the interval to 1 sec, and restarting Firefox, the temp fix was active, and the Add-ons were working.
</p><p>So I concluded: you have to have normandy enabled (which enables Heartbeat, Firefox' User Voice). So maybe that's what hinders the getting of the fix.
</p><p>I have a question: Do I have to let Studies be enabled for the fix to be working?
</p><p>TIA,

I get ads by the tons now that I have never gotten before, someone has figured out how to disable permanently your add ons and pretty much makes the program useless now.  Every time I try to install an app I get the message there is no connection with no explanation of why there is no connection, even if I go to the add ons own website, the connection is killed by something in the Firefox.

</p><p>Debemos recordar que hay millones de usuarios afectados, y que estas personas, podrían valorar cambiarse de navegador y pasarse a Chrome si el problema de las extensiones, va a ser metido en un cajón y revisado ""algún día de estos"" o si ya hay un equipo de personas que trabaja constantemente en solucionarlo en unas pocas horas.
</p><p>Creo que si millones de usuarios se descargan tu producto y lo usan, debería haber un sentimiento de agradecimiento por parte de Mozilla, que les diga de forma más clara, cuando van a solucionar el problema.

Today I suddenly get a message that it can't be verified for use with Firefox and has been disabled. No warning, no consultation, no chose! Yet another example of arrogant 'we know better than you' attitude. This is unacceptable. I have multiple up-coming medical and other appointments etc which are now unavailable. The hotfix appears to have been applied and I have reset the verification requirement to false and restarted Firefox. Still no sign of Reminder Fox. If it can be remotely disabled then it should be able to be re-enabled. It is my risk and my right to run whatever I wish on my own computer and it is not the prerogative of Mozilla or anyone else to unilaterally and without consultation to over-ride my decision. I am forced to ask for help in this forum as it appears to be impossible to actually ask FireFox support any questions.
The options provided by Mozilla are unhelpful. There is no reasonable alternative with the functionality that Reminder Fox offers, and no alternative that will even accept Reminder Fox data. The developer is no longer in business - probably driven to quit by the actions of Mozilla development!
I would be most grateful to anyone who can provide either a fix for this problem, or a method of contacting Mozilla support.

</p><p>I used Firefox 56.0.2 because I NEED to use legacy add-ons that ensure security and safety, these add-ons have no alternative in Quantum and no update.  All of my other Add-ons have versions that support this edition of Firefox.
</p><p>TODAY three of my important Firefox add-on were DISABLED BY FIREFOX, with no warning or caution and without my authority.
</p><p>The updates were
</p><p>LASTPASS
UBLOCK ORIGIN
GHOSTERY
</p><p>I think it is extremely unlikely that these three companies unilaterally and randomly all decided to stop using the add-ons on the SAME DAY.  I might have left those companies reviews expressing my concern by now that they have been disabled I can’t leave a review. So there is this fake positive picture painted of reviews on Mozilla site.
</p><p>So I can only presume that it was MOZILLA FIREFOX that FORCED this on me, pitting my loyalty of one set of add-ons with another.
</p><p>I am DISGUSTED by this behaviour from Mozilla, oh yes I am sure they will want to blame the add-on providers but it will be under their suggestion, rules or whatever.
</p><p>I still can’t update the legacy add-ons (which still work) nor is there any alternative in Quantum.
</p><p>I was quite happy in my time shell using add-ons I trusted and relied upon, that are secure in their own right, SO WHY IS MOZILLA MESSING WITH ME.
</p><p>I can guess the responses will be just go ahead an upgrade Firefox, but WHY SHOULD I BE FORCED KICKING AND SCREAMING into a version of Firefox that does not meet my needs.
</p><p>The bigger question is WHY WOULD I TRUST MOZILLA FIREFOX when they can mess with my productivity and give me this problem at their whim when I can choose Opera, Chrome in all of it’s variants and not have this kind of problem.  They may be as bad but they have not hurt me already.
</p><p>So before I go I have to ask this community if they can help me.
</p><p>1.	Is there a fork of the old firefox that allows the install of legacy versions of add-on, i.e. one that does not have Mozilla poking it’s nose in?
2.	Is there a setting in About Config that may enable me to override this disabling of the above add-ons?
</p><p>I have not listed the legacy add-ons that still work because they are clearly not the problem and I am sure that there are many thousands of users that have different legacy add-ons that face this same problem.
</p><p>It was bad enough that EVERY time I used firefox I got these “your version of firefox is critically out of date” nagware messages and that even after closing them I got more nagging when I scrolled done.
</p><p>It is MY computer, MY risk, MY choice, if I can’t TRUST Mozilla to let me work in peace then I really do not think I can risk using a later version of Firefox.
</p><p>If anyone has any constructive advice THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTIONS ABOVE to get this working again I would appreciate it.

1258239,2019-05-04 21:14:46 UTC,2019-05-06T17:00:22Z,New addon not compatible now FF66,"<p>So today on my work computer ( i am still having issues with my personal computer(s) 10.6... ( see/read the previous ticket which is been closed not that it solved anything) because lastpass addon signature signing is not valid according to Firefox and nor can I download an older version that is compatible ). I went to do something on my work Firefox profile which I just recently created less than a week ago. I immediately noticed that tree style tabs was not open for some reason so I went to toggle it back on because sometimes it gets popped off, I couldn't find the icon so I went over to add-ons where I immediately notice that I had ""no""? add-ons I'm sorry they're called extensions now in the new button that said unsupported. And guess what was in the unsupported category lastpass and tree style taps with a big message about not being verified and that I should click for more info which tells me to contact the developer and blah blah blahat signing is required in Firefox 57 and above.... and now all of a sudden Now I have a big yellow bar ""one or more add-ons cannot be verifiedd and has been disabled"". So I went back and looked at the version of last passed since I apparently have an outdated version!!! 4.27.2.10 last updated May 2nd 2019 okay so what's the next course of action? I can either remove the addon or find a replacement, find a replacement doesn't find lastpass. However a search does, and guess what version it is............ it is the same version! If it weren't for auto fill on IOS and android I would go back to a text document because this is getting ridiculous, because it is not on all of my devices and it spontaneously disappears.
</p><p>I know this is a Firefox problem but this will require going to Mozilla to get this thing fixed.
</p><p>That's all I can think of for now other than frustration frustration frustration frustration frustration and I probably need to reopen my old ticket, which said wait for an update that we'll never come because the addon system changed.
</p><p><br>
</p><p>So I just went to my personal profile, same issue. Both profiles have been open ) simultaneously with no issues( since yesterday with the only thing changing that the computer has been put to sleep and woken back up. Here's a screen shot of all my add-ons on there..... Oddly enough the only thing that survived is ""multi pass"" which I haven't gotten around to touching yet.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><br>
So I just closed out of everything, unchecked reopen windows on login, did a full restart. And my work Firefox profile has my 2 extensions back but my personal profile does not. And Firefox things ""these extensions do not meet current standards so they have been deactivated"". My work computer is brand-new and I received it in October .... so? My personal Firefox profile was created in October or November 2018, and work profiles was created within the last two weeks (i moved from Safari too many tabs and i needed side tabs...). All should have current add-ons using ""current standards"" but Firefox doesn't think so?
</p><p>I know this is a Firefox problem but this will require going to Mozilla to get this thing fixed, so well unlikely I will be CCing to firefox/Mozilla.

Last night, I searched google for the webroot secure website to find a tech to help with the initial problem prompted by Mozilla's actions last night.
Because the webroot filtering was disabled, I unfortunately went to a BOGUS webroot site. I used their chat option and gave them my key code, and other very pertinent info. as I described the problem with Firefox's actions. They were supposed to call back - they have not. Why?
Well, today, after Mozilla RESTORED my add-ons, I went to Google again to search for the webroot site to talk to a tech - Ha...the very site I used last night (that now has my personal info) was the one site that WEBROOT filtering warned me not to visit and told me to ""go back to safety""
You can understand my total frustration and anger that this event has caused me. Your own actions has caused me and my computer to NOW BE COMPROMISED.  I now have to try and abolish my primary email address, my personal  phone number and WAIT for Monday to talk to Webroot Technicians. They have emailed me back and asked that we handle this issue on the phone - but they are not there until Monday. I have been compromised, my antivirus has been compromised and my computer has been compromised - all DIRECTLY because of your missteps and your mistakes.

I am connected to my usual home network, and everything works just fine on my other devices. LastPass is of critical importance to me and is the only password manager I trust. If I cannot use this with firefox's new update, I'm definitely switching back to chrome. Please tell me there is a way to re-enable my extensions, and that I will be able to work the way I need to on Firefox.

b) ignore YOUR interest aka ""keeping you safe"", focus on USER interest aka ""I can do that myself, keep my personal addons in place!""

</p><p>I am pretty sure I'm not the only person with this issue. This is not a rant but a breakdown of my experience with it. So please read it and do something about the problem.
</p><p>Today when I turned on my PC and opened FF (first thing I do) the first thing that struck me was that ALL of my addons are disabled for no good reason and I have to ""find replacements"" for them. That just removes at least an hour of my time only to set up a browser that was fine and dandy just yesterday, without an option to keep the old version or postpone the decision. My work heavily relies on some of those addons, so it's incredibly irritating. Even worse, when I click ""find a replacement"" on one of them, it doesn't actually look for replacements, it simply lands me on the addons page. So that means I have to re-establish my whole environment with new addons. Some of them have no replacements. And even then, when I find a replacement for the first one in my list: AdBlock Plus, it shows me a few other AdBlocks (again, my choice of ABP is because it has some features other adblocks don't have), it says ""Download failed. Please check your connection"". At which point I don't even know what to do.
</p><p>This situation is completely ridiculous and backwards, there was no update or warning that you're changing some policies and since so many addons don't work (even themes!) I can only assume this came as a surprise to many addon devs as well. This looks pretty much like the transition to FF 57 except it's way worse because it came out of nowhere and I don't see a way to get back my FF customization.
</p><p>So please, FF team... oh god, I can't even simply ask you to do it properly at this point, it's completely f**ed up. Please fix this mess of a situation asap. FF is already being far behind Chrome in popularity and I wish so much it was a technically superior product, yet mismanagement like that only puts it into an even worse position. And as an extremely passionate and dedicated fan of Mozilla, I fear the worst, that I could at some point switch to another browser.

I am very upset that not only did firefox disable my extensions, but blocks downloading them from the firefox extension site. The reason that I have been a firefox user since it was Netscape Navigator is the ability to customize the GUI to work for me. As it stands on log in today, I might as well go use edge. 
I simply do not understand why firefox insists on removing customization ability, how does it hurt firefox if I want to have a freaking status bar at the bottom of the screen, or my tabs below the tool bar? 
Is this going to be fixed and if so when? Or will I have to hack together some sort of kludge in the css styles like I did to move my tabs?

But a few moments ago when just sitting idle on Wikipedia, I got a popup from Firefox saying the addon isn't recognized anymore and has been removed. Looking into the settings for further info, it said stuff about it no longer being verified in Firefox and took me to some page that described the issue but it didn't explain much, just something about ""improving"" or updating itself to be safer; removing my ad blocker sure doesn't make it safer. It had a link to take me to other addons to replace the missing one but there apparently are none. Just a bunch of Firefox addons I'm not interested in. Adblock Plus is literally the only addon I use.
</p><p>(For the record, I got the same error message for the Trend Micro toolbar, that it was no longer ""verified"" so had been removed, though I didn't have it enabled.)
</p><p>I went to the Adblock Plus site and tried downloading/installing it again and this time, Firefox refused, saying the file appeared ""corrupt"" so it would not install it. (That's a lie. I installed it just fine the other day.)
</p><p>I'm now posting this from (a competing browser) because I refuse to surf the Web without a reputable ad blocker installed--a previous computer was ruined (WITH up-to-date antivirus software running) because of a hijacked ad. Is Firefox now banning Adblock Plus? What am I supposed to use in the meantime?
</p><p>I much prefer Firefox over (competing browser) but I can't use it like this. It is literally not safe. :(
</p><p>Just realized, too, that I can only browse a certain site on my tablet with Firefox for mobile and its Adblock Plus addon, which (mobile version of competing browser for Android) doesn't have. Is that going to stop working, too? So now I can't visit my most-used website while on a tablet?

I have used the same profile for almost 3 years now and after fresh Windows installation after every few months, I restore the profile that I backed up before installing Windows. Today, after restoring, Firefox reads bookmarks, logins, tabs, but does not read history. Generally if you visit a site, the link would grey out and you'd know you have already visited it, but it doesn't do that anymore. It greys the new links I open, but not the ones I opened last month or last week. I'm using Firefox 64 x86. It auto updates, so it's safe to assume that it was exactly the version I used yesterday.
Thank you.

Some user cannot store any passwords in firefox. Just after the login i click save on the password-save-notification, aferwards i check the stored passwords in the settings, and it's empty.
Just few users are affected. Other users are able to safe the password on the same Website/URL. I did some tests: I created a new Firefox profile and even a new Windowsprofile (which causes a new %AppData% folder and new User-Registry) and tested it on different VMs. Nothing helps. 
According to an help-article, the passwords are saved in the files key4.db and logins.json which are located in the firefox profile in %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*random*.default\
I noticed that those files are not existing in the profiles of the users with the issue. In the profile of other users, this two files are existing. I checked the file permission of the folder, the user has full access, so this shouldn't be the cause.
I have no idea. Can someone say why some user cannot store passwords in Firefox, or why those two files are not existing for this users.

I use very often private links (but also ""normal"" links), so this is very uncomfortable and inconvenient for me. Please provide a config setting for opening links in new private tabs instead of new private windows. Or if it exists, tell me how can I set it. I know that there are extensions for this, but I do NOT want to install an extension for every ordinary setting. This should be possible without installing any extension... For example, in Chromium this is the default (it opens private links using the previously opend private window).

If I do a Search at the top of the Bookmarks Sidebar on the info associated with various Bookmarks that are missing, it appears the folder is there but misplaced somehow. In the Search info, the location of the URL is not listed in Bookmarks, if it were it would be easy to find where the URL is. I have selected Sort BY Name but and looked around in some folders but that hasn't helped find it.
</p><p>If I had IE 11, all I would need to do is find a previous Favorites file, open it and and drag and drop the missing folder into the Favorites but I cannot do that with Firefox. (It would be very nice if I could since I have many backups of Bookmarks.) Since I discovered the one missing or misplaced folder in Bookmarks, I have added more URLS to my Bookmarks so using the Restore option will not be good unless I can somehow bring back in folders that I have updated since.
</p><p>Because there appears to be NO phone Support by Mozilla, which is very poor, I cannot get this quickly resolved. I am running Windows 10 (1809) and have Firefox version 66.0.3 (64-bit).
</p><p>How can I find what appears to be a misplaced folder in my Bookmarks or restore it and keep my later saved Bookmarks?

Sorting by name can't be that difficult to do!
