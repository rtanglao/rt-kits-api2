I cant go to restore previous date, because I have fresh windows with no dates accept today. I cant import from file, because my computer crashed and had to format and reinstall windows without planing to do that, so I didn't had chance to export file.
I was hoping that Sync will do it's only purpose and have my bookmarks synced. But it didn't, it didn't even gave me some previous version of sync, it gave me nothing... What should I do now?

</p><p>I have recently updated my PC with a new RAM and a new SSD (the old hard disk is now the secondary repository) and I have installed Windows 10 on it. However, I have a very particular problem: all browsers crash after a few minutes (if not seconds) after I launch them. I can play with no problems some games on Steam, but browsers - which should be much easier to run - crash. Starting from yesterday, also other programs are crashing from time to time.
</p><p>I share with you my specs
OS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (fully updated to the latest version)
CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 965 (sometimes it goes beyond 60°C for a few seconds, but not during crashes)
RAM: 2x8 GB DDR3 1,600 mHz (dual channel)
Motherboard: ASUSTekM4A87TD/USB3
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 (Asus Rog Strix version)
SSD: 465GB Crucial CT500MX500SSD1
HHD: 931GB Hitachi HDS721010CLA332
</p><p>I also share a crash ID: bp-a9c808c6-3f2f-4364-b716-b018c0190730
</p><p>I have tried replacing the new RAM with the old one (2x2 GB) with no effect at all.
Needless to say, all drivers are updated (GPU drivers through GeForce Experience software).
</p><p>Hope you have some suggestions!

I have to downgrade to FF 67, and disable all updating, and I had to disconnect my network connection to do that since FF updates automatically by default. I tried the latest 69b build as well, and got the same problem. I disabled and re-enabled hardware acceleration. No change. It seems that complicated sites running  a lot of Javascript that do anything with cookies some how kill the tab. If the tab is restored, it just crashes again.

Firefox v67 has done a good job saving/restoring all of them each time I launch the program. When the browser informed me of the v68 upgrade, I allowed it to install. At first launch after the upgrade, I was presented with a single fresh FF window with no history and no options to restore previously closed tabs/windows.
I fiddled with it a bit... investigating options, closing/re-opening the browser, trying to see if there was anything to recover, including peeking into FF's disk storage, but to no avail.
I began opening new windows/tabs to rebuild my normal setup. After a couple of days, from within a non-browser app I launched a URL (like pulling up online help). In response to that system request, a separate instance of FF launched and this instance restored all of my original pre-upgrade windows/tabs!
And note these are separate instances (see attached photo of Process Explorer). So for example, I cannot drag a tab from a window in one instance and drop it onto a window in the other instance.
</p><p>So now the big questions:
What is the minimum amount of tab/window loss I can incur by shutting down each instance?
In what order should I shut them down?
When I re-launch after closing both instances, will FF only restore one set of windows/tabs?
And will it be from the most-recently-closed instance?

However, the console log routinely hides most of what I write to it. I can plainly see that, even though the script executes from the beginning, the log starts somewhere in the middle of the script execution, and vital information that I *NEED* is always cut off ""above the fold"".
</p><p>I would be willing to settle for:
1.) Seeing ALL the console log entries my script writes, not just the small subset Firefox decides to show me
2.) Logging to a file instead of the console
3.) Using a remote logging service, if there is a free one that works (IE not Loggly). 
4.) Running a webserver on my computer and logging via remote calls to that
5.) A way to use JSON.stringify to append the log to tags in the open web page... I actually had this working, but Firefox logs objects as ""[object object]"" so I can't see them. I already know they're objects, I need to see what they contain!
</p><p>Any of these would work for me. I just need to be able to look at the log and see the order the various parts of my scripts executed in. 
</p><p>What would NOT work for me is:
</p><p>1.) Using the script debugger. The problem I'm seeing is very sporadic, and my script uses jQuery, the amount of javascript that executes very quickly is really large, so manually stepping through script execution would require literally hours or days of tapping away, without even being sure the error will occur for me to see. I really need to just be able to use the web normally, and then, when the error occurs, being able to look at the log and see the script execution documented exactly as I set up my console.log commands to do. 
</p><p>The fact that I just spent the better part of two days unable to find a simple solution to the problem of just viewing my script's log entries, is making me think Firefox is not an adequate browser for javascript development. Am I making a mistake trying to develop on Firefox? Is Firefox no good for troubleshooting javascript on?

It may be busy, or it may have stopped responding permanently. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if it will complete.

</p><p>This happens with different scripts, on different webpages.
</p><p>And while displaying this window, Firefox actually stops loading and processing anything until I click ""Continue"", ""Stop script"" or the close-button of the window.
Firefox does not try to continue to work in the background or so. No, it actually causes the real unresponsiveness. Only if I click the message window away, it continues. And it never did not continue yet then.
</p><p>I know that I have a rather slow computer, but I do not want Firefox to annoyingly remind me of that. Browsing would be fine for me without this message. 
</p><p>I of course searched about:config, and also this forum, but did not figure out how to disable this annoyance for example by increasing a timeout or changing some other value...
I tried altering many preferences like dom.max_script_run_time , dom.max_ext_content_script_run_time or dom.max_chrome_script_run_time , but that did not resolve it.
Googling for ""Unresponsive add-on script"" I only found others having this problem (without working solutions) and references to the sourcecode.
I will not disable the add-ons. I do not need a fix for an allegedly unresponsive add-on script, because everything in this regard works just fine; i just need an option like: ""Always continue, and never ever dare to ask me anything like that again"".

</p><p>The reason being: Reader Mode could be used to enhance the web experience. I sometimes use Reader Mode in already hard to parse through websites (ad infested sites, with anti adblocker features) and some sites don't account for those who have dyslexia. Reader Mode can bridge the gap for these people and others who might wind up on legacy / really old websites that wont be updated (thinking of Space Jam).

I have followed the printer reset procedures in article  <a href=""http://mzl.la/1BAQqop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mzl.la/1BAQqop</a> and re-installed the printer too.
Have run FF in safe mode.
In all cases the problem persists.

One laptop recently developed a problem when typeing the oligarch password. Incorrect random charactors were being entered instead of the chosen keystroke. Verified by using a keystrike logger.

</p><p>I started off having problems with quite a lot of extensions installed, but I've done some investigation and so I'll describe the most basic form of the problem.
</p><p>I'm running Firefox Quantum 68.0.1 (64 bit) on Ubuntu MATE 18.04.2 LTS on a 4GB RAM VirtualBox 6.0.8 r130520 (Qt5.6.2) guest under a Windows 7 host. 3D acceleration is enabled in VirtualBox and I have the guest extensions (version 6.0.8) installed.
</p><p>To start off from a clean Firefox configuration, I move the .mozilla directory aside to some random name and start Firefox. In a new tab I visit <a href=""https://panopticlick.eff.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://panopticlick.eff.org/</a> and choose ""Test Me"". The test process starts but as it comes to the results page the tab crashes. This is a fresh configuration so there are no addons, themes or extensions other than the defaults. I've tried disabling hardware acceleration in the preferences but it doesn't fix the problem.
</p><p>If I restart Firefox in safe mode the Panopticlick site works fine.
</p><p>When the tab crashes I don't seem to get any information; about:crashes shows no crashes, perhaps because Firefox hasn't crashed, just the tab.
</p><p>What I've read so far suggests that if it works in safe mode but not otherwise the problem is an addon or extension, but I don't have any. Is there any way to get any more information about the crash?
</p><p>For what it's worth, other sites - but not all - show similar tab crashing behaviour which can be avoided by going into safe mode. <a href=""http://ebay.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.co.uk</a> seems quite prone to it, but it doesn't always go wrong immediately; I've mentioned Panopticlick above because it seems to be a reliable way of reproducing the problem and doesn't require any authentication before it goes wrong.
</p><p>Thanks.

In the mean time, something was happening to the other computer (the one I'm having the sync problem with) with regard to it wanting me to sync again and again, over and over.  I login and it seems from the yellow triangle with exclamation mark that the browser wants me to re-sync.  maybe I dont know what I'm doing.  No, I certainly dont know what I'm doing.

You go there and your block autoplay in firefox works when you visit the site the first time.
Then you see a video you would like to play.
You press the play button.
You watch a video.
But then...
After you press play well...
Autoplay is reactivated and the only thing to do is to exit firefox, do a thorough cache clean then start over again.
I know you are hard at work...there!
Wish this could be fixed....

I have used firefox for years and love the sync facility for passwords. Recently firefox  became very slow and sometimes even froze. Went looking for a solution on the intenet and tried everything to no avail. Eventually uninstalled and removed every trace of firefox. Renistalled and everything was ok for a short while. Soon back being incredible slow. Chrome seemed to work much better and was acceptable. However while doing a test on intenet speed I got an error message from the site saying a firewall maybe preventing access. Made me think. No firewall problems on my router as my other computer with firefox on the same router was fine. Windows defender switched off.  I then remebered I accidentally ended up with real time protection from malwarebites premium trial . I did not ask fot it.  I switched real time protection malwarebites premium features off and rebooted computer . Everything fine since then. Firefox super fast and chrome a lot faster too. Hope this helps someone

The thing is why I am writing also here (also informed F-secure also), is that total privacy (that ofc is the idea of Mozilla and Thunderbird). The one part of the cyber attack or rather attacks are (tried to) hide themselves by using ie. in the Mozilla, Mozilla Dev Ed. and Thunderbird as ""fronts"" to do their illegal stealing of all private info. The attack actually pings every 2 minutes everything about what I have done (software,  settings, keylogger etc...) and sending it forwards.

If i may ask just put some msg, that this is about the Mozilla issue, because I would not rather want my Linkedin to turn into Instagram or something else (I hope you take no offence and can undertand my wish, it is only that, a wish)
</p><p>I suspect Illegal usage of MS Azure (as info is sent to both Akamai (MS Azure server base in Holland) and to Amazonaws (to be exact I suspect Amazon S3). The attack does not end there, it is also connected to my both cells (Samsung s9 and Huawei Honow  7S). WIn 10 home has client server, group admin policies, Async, Active Directory, SharedDNS etc... 
</p><p>Also information is sent to the cells by cookies and bc.googleconsent. So everything is connected together.
</p><p>I am using F-Secure safe (in both Laptop and both cells) and it can go trough and fool the anti-virus, but when looking at the ie. right of the apps on android, it seems that they have been given huge boost (the most rights I have counted is 112. Meaning that they can take over everything in my phone, make calls, close calls, find out every connection, take over bluetooth, wifi etc... Also Firefox is influenced there just as it is on the Laptop (HP Omen).
</p><p>I am sorry for my hurried input, but as the thing is so huge, I think that if the main company (Mozilla) is willing, I think this needs a direct communication, or with some other goodhearted person.

During the interview I had to resort to my email about scheduling details and a pop up to ""Refresh"" Firefox came up.  Being somewhat tired I allowed it.  And being partly blind I failed to notice that my Yahoo email had the  "" Say signed in"" in their default ""Go"" position.  I signed out of my email but when I reopened the computer several minutes later,I noticed all my emails were there for anyone to read.  Since this involved a patent situation, where IP stealing is always a problem, this was a concern.  I logged out and was able to closed the email access only 10 or 20 minutes after the initial breach.  But I wonder if the Firefox ""Refresh"" created a restore point so that a person with administrative authority on the computer could do a system restore to the point of Firefox ""Refresh"" and gain access to all my sensitive emails.  Unfortunately the Yahoo default ""stay signed in"" often tends to put the user in rape- ready position.  Subsequent refreshes or restarts may inadvertently leave the front door open for hacking of all your emails involving lawyers, accountants, mistresses, political improprieties etc.

There are two questions regarding the preservation of links to a web page in the form of files with the extension * .URL.
1. I opened in Firefox, for example, 50 tabs with various web pages. And I need to save each of the open web pages as a separate * .URL file. I repeat: do not bookmark all these addresses, but quickly save them as separate URL files. Is it possible to do this using the Firefox toolkit?
2. Previously, in Firefox, I could create a URL file by simply dragging the link from the address bar to Explorer or any file manager using the mouse. Now I can not do this. This option is no longer available in Firefox, or is it still possible to resolve this using settings?
Thanks in advance for your help.

This works great as the addons auto download, and the remove button is removed from the add-ons setting page in Firefox after the policy is applied. However, I've noticed that if you goto Firefox's addons website and search for an extension that is installed, that site gives you a remove button. If you click the button, the extension does get removed. Neither rebooting nor reapplying the group policy restores the extension even though the extension is still listed in the policy. They only way to reinstall it, is to manually browse for it on the site again and install it. It seems that removing the extension should not be possible given the policy.

</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Professional, latest updates installed (Version 1903)
</li><li> Clean Windows installation, barely any applications installed
</li><li> No Firefox add-ons installed
</li><li> Have tried reinstalling Firefox several times
</li><li> Firefox Safe Mode is even worse, it is unusable, drawing only tiny pieces of the window or nothing at all
</li><li> Disabling Hardware acceleration for Firefox has the same effect as Safe Mode
</li><li> Although I think a virus is highly unlikely, I've run a full scan anyway with nothing found
</li><li> No other applications have this issue
</li></ul>
<p>More info:
</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Professional is running inside the latest version of Parallels Desktop
</li><li> Connected to a 4K 32"" monitor running at 100% scaling
</li><li> Changing scaling removes border but as soon as I resize once, white border reappears and I cannot resize
</li><li> Just tried disconnecting external display and running on laptop screen at various different resolutions, still no luck
</li></ul>
<p>Running inside a VM seems like the main point of difference - However I would have thought disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox would make that less relevant (instead, Firefox loses its mind with it off...).

I update it regularly, it's convenient for me to see notifications of new updates and install them whenever I see fit. I recently noticed that Firefox creates a folder on every computer C:\ProgramData\Mozilla\updates, which is not good for the portable version, really. The only way to stop this I found was to completely disable updates via distribution\policies. I don't want to. How do I get firefox to notify me of updates and download them to a USB flash drive (it will be perfect if i could specify folder for this purpose) instead of leaving files on other people's computers?

This uploaded message is about extension info but it also happens when a new version is available (what I have noticed).
Maybe something to point out is that I have my taskbar on the top of the screen (so it flashes on the bottom as you can see).

1265349,2019-07-24 02:14:14 UTC,2019-07-24T12:09:50Z,"Firefox updated two times while my computer was asleep and I was gone. When I got back, all my bookmarks and history were gone.","<p>I simply want to add this, as it might help someone else. I'll be describing what happened, how I figured it out and how I fixed it, in the hopes that it will help someone else without them having to dig intothe middle of a 2 page answer down the page with a lot of useless into.   I can't believe I actually managed to muddle through it by myself, as I was relying on the ""help"" pages. Some of them are pretty good but some are not and some are useless. 
</p><p>Here's the deal: everytime FF downloads, I have to redo some of the settings. I keep it set so that it will not install unless I say so. It did anyway. Then 2 days later, (my computer sat idle as something else came up) FF downloaded another upgrade and installed it. This time it also reset it to install automatically, and restarted with the welcome screen, period.  I did not know this until I went to resume my work.  So when I went back to the computer, I discovered that nothing I'd left was there. AND no history or bookmarks. Confusing as hell. I tried to follow the instructions, but just went in circles.  It was trying to get me to connect with my phone, but my phone was still using the older version of FF, and it wasn't working. So I started reading the help pages and getting more and more confused and frustrated. 
</p><p>Sorry you are going to get the long version of this story because I am still venting. 
</p><p>As I was to eventually learn, FF created a new profile on my laptop and set it as default. I bet I read at least 40-50 ""help"" pages before I stumbled across that.  So typed in about:profile and there they were, Two of them. Then things got easy. Well, easier. The two were identical except for the labels and a string of numbers. And one said it was default and the other said default something else. But each had a button I could click to see them in the browser.  One was my old stuff! So I left it up while I checked the other. Yep, the bare bones one. I changed the first one, with all my goodies, to default.  
</p><p>But that meant I had to shut both down for the next step. Because I had no intention of leaving the other one on the computer, though I know it would have been harmless as long as I didn't click on it. So to make it easy, I shut down FF and opened the profile page in my FF account using another browser, double checked that I was about to delete the useless profile, and did.  Went back to FF, and it opened up looking just as it should, cluttered with tabs, all my bookmarks and history intact (I use the history as an easy way to get back to sites I use a lot in my research, - basically use it as key words.)
</p><p>Everything is as it should be now (as far as I know. With a lot less pain than the method of attack suggested elsewhere. Even managed to get the phone linked in, though I don't plan on using FF on it anymore. Another discovery along the way was Duck Duck Go. Love it as a search engine, love it even more as a clean little browser on my phone. 
</p><p>This should not have taken as much time and effort as it did. It makes sense to me now that a new profile identical to the old would behave this way. Yeah, I guess something went wrong with the migration, alright.  but why did it take people who should be familiar with it so long to figure it out?  and then made the fix more complicated than it needed to be?  And why did the second install not simply replace the one that was there? I am both inquisitive and stubborn. And if I didn't like the way FF works and have serious concerns about other browsers, I would simply have given up and gone to some other browser. Betcha some people did. 
</p><p>Ok, this is way longer than even I thought it would be, but I don't much feel like editing it down to a more reasonable length just now. Feel free.

I use Firefox as my default browser and have had no problems with it until two days ago, when it suddenly developed a massive delay. it shows up in multiple ways. When opening a webpage, my CPU will jump to about 50% and I cannot scroll for a number of seconds, as many as 10 seconds. Also, highlighting/copying/pasting operations have as much as a 10-second delay before they appear on screen, and I sometimes cannot type in a search box for several seconds or text I do type doesn't appear in a search box for several seconds. I've tried refreshing Firefox and also starting it in safe mode with add-ons disabled, but the same symptoms happen then. I uninstalled and reinstalled and that had no effect. I performed a complete uninstall using Revo uninstaller, rebooted and reinstalled and even then it still has the same symptoms, even though I haven't added any add-ons or extensions. I've run malware scans and disk cleanup with no improvement. I can browse normally with IE or Chrome and they show none of these symptoms, but I prefer Firefox. Please help me determine what suddenly changed on July 20th or 21st, 2019. I've used Firefox for years and never had a problem like this, and no amount of refreshing/reinstalling/rebooting/disabling add-ons or extensions seems to have any effect. If it comes down to a complete format/reinstall of Windows, I'll likely just use a different browser but I'd really like to get Firefox working again.

And because the rest of the address bar is reduced, it's difficult to edit the address on the fly (e.g. I want to change a single value in the url, but have to scroll to find it).  There's nothing to grab to shrink it (like between the address and search boxes); nothing on right-click; can't find any extensions that address it; DigiCert website was not helpful; internet search turned up nothing...

</p><p>I have had issues for few days now when using Google Sheets. It started last Wednesday July 17th  (everything worked smoothly on Tuesday).
</p><p>Issues: 
- big delay on commands
- slow reaction only on this page
- constant message ""website is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do?"" with options to ""wait"" or ""stop""
</p><p>After browsing for solution there was nothing aiming at this specific problem. So, my first troubleshooting step was to refresh my Firefox profile. While doing so, issue dissapeared for few seconds, but returned after. I have noticed that it was around moment my extensions started popping in browser.
</p><p>Anyways, today I opened Firefox in safe mode to troubleshoot extensions. Everything worked fine so I decided to disable extensions one by one. Since I had only 4 of them and 2 were disabled already there was no much work there.
</p><p>The last one enabled was Mozilla's Pioneer. Issue persists. I give it a go, and there it was. The one I'd suspect last. Reenabling others works pretty fine.
</p><p>So I wanted to share this if somebody stumbles upon same issue. I would also like for Mozilla to try and solve this issue with Pioneer.
</p><p>Best regards,
Josip

Of course I can close the tab, but repeatedly doing it is annoying.

My projects involve two frames...left frame is table of contents, right frame is the ""main frame"". I hide the table of contents until the mouse goes over to a certain part of the screen...when this happens, the contents frame ""pops out"". When the mouse leaves the contents frame, the frame hides itself again.
Since the last Firefox update, (July 18 2019, I believe), the pop-out / hide functions aren't working. The frames still load in, but they won't pop out or hide when they're supposed to. They stay at whatever size I resize the frame to.
In addition to this, my personal project pages are no longer loading in the fonts they are supposed to. Everything seems to be defaulting to the system (or Firefox) standard.
</p><p>More Information: The pop-out / hide functions only seemed to ever work with Firefox. I never could get it to work with Opera / Chrome / IE. This is the main reason I stuck with Firefox for so long.
</p><p>Is this an error that is going to be fixed, or a byproduct of a change that's been made that I'm just going to have to live with?
I can provide more information if needed.

When I'm editing a field of text, eg. in Google Docs, I've occasionally started editing or selecting text one character to the right. Like as if in that split second I just happened to send the keystroke when the ghost caret appeared. But because it was so brief, it is near impossible to replicate.
</p><p>I've tried Firefox in safe-mode and there was no ghost caret. So I removed all add-ons/extensions, but the ghost caret still appears even if I have no extensions installed, which is why it's so baffling. I've refreshed and re-installed Firefox, both didn't work.
</p><p>This ""ghosting"" only happens in Firefox, not in IE nor Chrome.
</p><p>I used a screen capturing software and recorded this problem, then extracted a frame from the video to show the real caret and ghost caret side by side. Hope this better illustrates what I'm seeing. I have Dark Reader activated so the ghost caret can be easily seen. If Dark Reader isn't activated, it would be impossible to see due to the white background.
</p><p>I do most of my work on cloud based platforms so this ghosting is very annoying and distracting. Or worse, could it be a keylogger or malicious program causing this?

The found-text highlight colour is a very pale blue, and is only as big as the word. 
</p><p>I would like to see, and so suggest, something along these lines:
</p><p>- a brighter result highlight, more vibrant and contrasting than pale blue (this could be customisable &amp; maybe themable too)
</p><p>- a border around the result, or at least an oversized highlighted region
</p><p>- an eye-catching animation to draw your vision towards the search result, such as a pulse in scale, or a large box fading in and shrinking to wrap around the result.
</p><p><br>
This is very simple to reproduce to check what I am saying, if you haven't already noticed this! Just open a document with many pages and columns and images, zoom out and choose one of the page spread options, and then Ctrl+F search for a word.

When opening the archive from the directory, however, I don't experience this problem.
PS: Downloading the same archive from ""private browsing"" with all addons disabled, still produces the same result.
</p><p>My guess is it has something to do with the way Firefox opens the file in the first place.
It should be noted that UAC is disabled, I am in the built-in Administrator account as well as completely disabled UAC (EnableLUA) from registry.

</p><p>is this any Firefox very very bad joke or i get/read something very wrong?
How is that blocking extension is collecting unlimited users data and its Firefox Recommended...?
</p><p>how is that possible Mozilla to allow something like this to happen, company which fight for privacy and freedom to allow such suspicious things and even recommend them...?
do this means fight = ""fight"" and privacy = ""privacy"" (so both are not really what they supposed to be...?)

Click Restart Firefox to finish applying it. We will restore all your pages, windows and tabs afterwards, so you can be on your way quickly.""

I CAN successfully start Firefox if I use safe mode, but as soon as I try again without safe mode, the issue described above immediately happens.
I've tried disabling the update service, but nothing seems to make a difference.

<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/</a>
</p><p>mozilla is going to block third-party tracking cookies by default (based on a blacklist). I don't understand the difference between the ""trackers"" and ""cookies"" -&gt; ""third party trackers"" option in the firefox settings.
The news tells me that ""just"" the cookie option will be enabled by default, meaning that the trackers are still loaded.
</p><p>Lets talk about the effects in case of google analytics?
When I activate the tracker-block option or use adblock, I will get errors in the developer console (or in add ons) that google analytics isn't found/loaded.
When I activate the upcoming third party tracker cookie option I DON'T get this message - so analytics is still executed. Isn't analytics simply not working anymore at all because it is using its cookies OR are there only SOME functions of analytics that will not work anymore?
</p><p>Could anyone clarfiy this for me?

Gosh, but I hate Firefox Sync!!  I didn't realise that I was permanently signed in to my account across both devices once I had, just for a laugh, signed in 1 week ago.  As a result, my bookmarks had automatically synced across two users on the same device, which I didn't want to happen.  As I didn't want this, I deleted - when logged on as user 2 - the bookmarks that had been synced across from  user 1.  Then when I logged back in as user 1, those bookmarks had been deleted there as well  becasue of that damn Sync function.
Is there ANY way I can get those deleted bookmarks back as user 1?  I have permanently signed out of Sync now and hope I never see the damn thing again.

Many website owners and CDN providers want the web servers or proxy servers to be able to do load balancing. For example, when the server is overloaded, redirect the request to some other servers; or based on the client IP address, send the client to a server that can provide better performance.
What they can use today is the 30X redirection. Which has many limitations:
1. breaks the cookie, if you 30x redirect to another hostname or IP address.
2. breaks https if you redirect to another IP address.
We need another way of telling the client/browser to only change the IP address but keep everything else the same. I'm proposing a simple addition to the HTTP protocol: new status code, for example: 312 with 2 new headers: ""x-redirect-ipv4"" and ""x-redirect-ipv6"". When a server wants to redirect the client to a different IP for whatever reason, it just returns this status code with headers with the IPv4 or v6 addresses. When the client (Firefox in this case) receives this, it picks one of the returned IPs and makes exactly the same HTTP(S) request again to that IP.

</p><p>I've gone through all the typical process of eliminations - verify it's not just my Firefox, my machine, my application, etc.
Scenario:
1)..Launch Firefox and visit a website that displays a Google Map.
2)..Click a link to leave that page and then return back to the page (either back-button-history or via a link).
3)..Notice that the tiles of the map are not displayed.  It appears as though Firefox is trying/failing to use some sort of its own cache(?) of the map tiles and is failing to render them.  Most other map layers will display (i.e.: markers).
</p><p>Easy to reproduce on Google's own API demo page:
1)..Visit:  <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map</a>
</p><pre>    and notice the sample map (see screenshot below as ""before"" image).
</pre>
<p>2)..Click a link on that page, so that you leave that page.
3)..Go back to the previous page and notice the map doesn't display the tiles (see ""after"" image attached).
</p><p>Observations:
1)..The above scenario fails on all sites I've tested, through different users/machines/demographics.
2)..The above works great in IE11, Chrome, Safari, just not Firefox.

General behaviour:
All Tabs are in his own container – cookies are deleted after closing such Tab. JS and flash is deactivated by default – they only receive referrers from the same domain – and the IP, UserAgent, Canvas and other values are fake.
I do not use any social media or other big player services, like YouTube, with accounts. All accounts I use are just on small web community boards and shop systems.
</p><p>But: At the end of the day the advertising industry and big players are able to identify me more or less. I see stuff that is too close to me to be random on a daily basis.
</p><p>So I am asking myself: How?
</p><p>The only thing to blame myself that I am aware of, is that I use FireFox on my a few desktops and mobile phones and set it up quite the same way. But every device of mine is behind VPN hops and use his own DNS, so it should not be any of that.

1264966,2019-07-18 09:35:35 UTC,2019-07-20T05:31:55Z,Three issues i've encountered with FF pdf built in viewer.,"<p>windows 10/FF 68.0+ a few add-ons
</p><p>Hello all
</p><p>i wanted to use FF as my default PDF viewer and since i wasn't able to do so in the Windows settings, i right clicked on a file and chose my default program.
</p><p>-first issue; all my pdf files took the FF icon instead of the default PDF one.
only solutions I've found was changing things in the registry which i wont do and the other one(not sure if it works)was to reinstall FF which i prefer not to do since everything is nicely set up.
</p><p>-second issue; in FF options i chose ""always ask""in case i accidentally open a PDF file when clicking on a link in google search,not noticing it's a PDF document.
the issue is that when i chose 'open' from the pop-up window,it opened a blank page,not the actual PDF i (haven't checked what happens with 'save'.)
so i reverted to 'preview in Firefox'.(also i don't recall this happening with previous windows os;7-8.1)
</p><p>-third issue(the worst one which caused a moment of panic :); choosing 'firefox to automatically open a file type' cause the opening of infinite blank tabs one after the other.
it seems to be a very old bug and I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed yet,
the solution is not to chose this option.

</p><p>so for the moment being I've reverted to Edge as the default PDF viewer.
</p><p>the main issue for me out of all these three, is to get those icons to show the correct description and not the FF one. 
</p><p>Thanks.

I would do something about that, but most of the laptop settings are behind a parental admin lock.
So when Windows reboots, any Firefox window gets closed. Opening it back used to prompt a session restore page and nothing else. But now, reopening causes these symptoms:
I'm logged out of ""Sync""
There's a tab about a Privacy Notice or something
There's a 'new tab' with a popup talking about the features of Firefox or something
Any Top Sites I pinned are GONE
""@amazon"" is pinned for no reason
I think my search sites settings are gone
Pretty sure I added a search bar to the toolbar, but not anymore
The theme reset to this default dark blue
Signing back into Sync does not solve any of this
What do I do about this madness???

</p><p>- updating Firefox (Arch Linux had a new version of the package which seemingly only changed the .desktop file used to launch it)
</p><p>- rebooting
</p><p>- reinstalling Firefox

I can't change every password!,"<p>I am so sick of Google, I decided to give Firefox a try again.  For the first time, it offered me Monitor, which demonstrated I have suffered a data breach, apparently at multiple sites, and they have all gotten hold of the same one of my passwords.  Even though I suspect Y'all are aware that the breach was not my doing, Firefox is set up to treat me like an idiot after the fact, going into detail about safe passwords and using password manager apps--the whole thing about not using one password for multiple sites and all that, which I've been aware of and responded to cautiously and reliably for about the last fifteen years, of about twenty that I've been online.
</p><p>The problem is that I am very internet savvy, so that info, as helpful as it is meant to be, is useless to me and a bit offensive.  I have been using LastPass for about the last five years.  I have nearly 300 unique passwords.  It is useless to me to be told that some strangers have access to one of my nearly 300 passwords.  What am I supposed to do with that information, change all my passwords?  Why did they not provide me the password that was part of the breach, so I can hunt it down and change it?  Right now, all it's done is set me up to worry, when in fact, the forces that absconded with my data, presumably as part of huge data breaches involving major companies, probably have no interest in me whatsoever!  I think presenting things in this manner, as well meant as it may have been, is a bit irresponsible and condescending.  Not everyone out here is an idiot, even if we may not be computer techs.  Is there any way I can learn which of my many passwords was part of this breach?  What else am I supposed to do with this info, when I already have unique passwords for all of my many accounts and I use a password manager?
</p><p>I mean no offense in presenting my frustration and understand you all are volunteers and not responsible for the problems as I have outlined them.  I hope someone can  help me sort this out.

obracím se na Vás se žádostí o pomoc s vyřešením tohoto problému: Ve firefoxu jsem byl zvyklý editovat a exportovat záložky do html souboru pro zálohování. Toto mi fungovalo dobře naposledy v únoru. S dalšími aktualizacemi firefoxu tyto funkce přestaly fungovat, firefox se zasekává, při pokusu o editaci záložek jako jsou smazání nefunkčních záložek nebo export záložek do html se prohlížeč zasekne a obsadí více než 2Gb operační paměti. Záložky ale nevyexportuje, nahlásí, že spí, zablokuje procesor na více než 100% a přestane fungovat. Dnes tj. 16. července 2019 odmítá ukládat i nové záložky. Instalovaná verze firefox 67.0.4., opreační systém Linux mint 18.3. Nepomohla ani přeinstalace firefoxu. Návod na exportování záložek na vašem webu nefunguje. Co mám dělat?
</p><p>Další problém, který s firefoxem mám, prohlížeč po ukončení se zcela neukončí a běží dál. Je nutné ho v prohlížeči systémových procesů ukončit ručně.
Při běžném prohlížení běžně obsazuje až 1Gb operační paměti, což je poměrně hodně.

I go to a site and click the link to comment. I had no problem getting to that point before, now i get a message that says ""this page sin't re directing properly.""
WHY? 
I read that maybe i need to clear the cookies.
GLAD TO.
but I cannot  find out where they are to clear them out. I look all around in security, i look all around in general.
i am so sick of this happening. I have to go to my outbox to fetch the email.
You KNOW THIS IS GETTING TIRESSOME
this browser isn't working for me anymore. I don't find it helpful, i don't find it is protecting anything it is just a nuisance.
SO I AM LOOKING FOR OTHER BROWSER.
IF YOU USE CHROME YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A PERSONAL TRACKER, I'M SURE EVERYONE HAS READ THE NYT ARTICLE.A
SO I LOOKED INTO mozilla pale moon and then looked into reviews and came across this""
Why You Shouldn’t Use Firefox Forks Like Waterfox, Pale Moon, or Basilisk.......... and it goes on and on about each. I didnd't read about all because I just want a fast, responsive browser that isn't going to make me crazy.
it said good things about firefox quantum -- I DO NOT KNOW if that is what i have now, i don't think so, but I do not want any headaches, i never want to be blocked from a site over friggin' cookies nd not be able to quickly clear them out. 
and then it says this:
""Even if you don’t completely trust some of Mozilla’s business decisions, your browser is just too important to be left to a small community of enthusiasts. We think it’s best to go with a big project with a large number of developers that receives a lot of attention to security. That’s why we recommend against using these smaller Firefox-based browsers, and why we also recommend against using alternative browsers based on Google Chrome. Here are our concerns with some of the more popular Firefox alternatives...""
I haven't read on, but look, I if until i can find what i can live with, I would be grateful for some help in finding out HOW NOT TO MAKE THIS BROWSER HARASS THE HELL OUT OF ME BY BLOCKING ME FROM GETTING AN EMAIL, WHEN I BLOODY WELL KNOW CNN IS A FINE SITE, AND PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HUNT ALL OVER HOW TO CLEAR COOKIES, WHERE ARE THEY? I 
HAVE ALLOWED ALL THESE SITES EVERYWHERE I CAN SEE TO IMPUT EVERY SITE SO THAT THE BROWSER KNOWS THAT IS IT OKAY.
</p><p>I WOULD BE SOOOOOOOOOOOO GRATEFUL JUST TO FIND A WELL SECURED BROWSER THAT ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ME WANT TO SCREAM BECASUE i CAN'T GET TO A SITE I WELL KNOW IS FINE, AND NOT A BOUTIQUE BROWSER, BECAUSE I THINK I CAN WELL SEE WHERE ""A SMALL GROUP OF ENTHUSIASTS"" CAN BECOME DISRUPTIVE TO PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND AN EMAIL.
DOES ANYONE AT ALL THINK YOU CAN PLEASE HAVE A SUGGESTION? 
EVEN IF IT IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MOZILLA?
or GOOGLE.
THANKS AND I APPRECIATE  IT IF YOU CAN GRASP HOW IRRITATING THIS IS AND JUST TRY TO HELP......
THANKS AGAIN SO MUCH!

I works fine until I put my computer to sleep. It is not connection problem because everything other than videos work. And with other browsers, videos also work. This problem started to happen recently for no good reason  - no windows update or FF update that caused it.   Does firefox play videos on it's own or does it depend on some external components? Tab icon shows me infinitely  loading animation. However, when I open dev tools and network tab, it shows me that it's downloading 771kb, which is the correct size of that video. When I right click and choose view page source then I can also see the contents of mp4 file. So it looks like file itself is downloaded but there is some component that does not get notification.

</p><p>Hello,
</p><p>WebVR implementation in Firefox has improved significantly but still some bugs are prohibitive from using it reliably. More specifically, integration with SteamVR appears to be problematic. Here's a test scenario.
</p><p>How to replicate the problem:
</p><p>0) Ensure SteamVR is installed and operational, using a compatible VR kit.
</p><p>1) Visit <a href=""https://sketchfab.com/AliceVision/models"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sketchfab.com/AliceVision/models</a>
</p><p>2) Open one of the models and select the VR icon (bottom right).
</p><p>3) Once the 3D model is presented in the VR headset, close the 3D model from within the web page and return to the list of 3D models (main page).
</p><p>4) 1st issue: Notice that in the headset, SteamVR shows that it's waiting for the application (Firefox in this case) to respond. This should not normally happen, i.e. when Firefox has no content to present, it should present a default 3D scene, for example: a dome with a firefox logo in the middle. Also, if you click on the System Button on the VR controller, the SteamVR Dashboard pops up BUT it does not offer the option to disengage/disconnect Firefox from SteamVR. That keeps SteamVR locked into Firefox. If you wait long enough, you get the ERRORS shown in the attached images.
</p><p>5) Open another 3D model and click on the VR button. The new model should appear in the VR headset.
</p><p>6) 2st issue: The VR controller is not longer tracked by Firefox.
</p><p>I hope you find the above useful and easy to replicate. If you need additional information, please do let me know.
</p><p>Kind regards

After I created the new profile, I went to the section that reads:
</p><p>Important: Firefox must be closed down while copying files between profile folders. Also, Step 1 refers to your ""old"" profile folder - the profile containing data you want to copy to a new profile. If you can't open a profile from within Firefox, see Finding your profile without opening Firefox.
</p><p>I found this instruction a little irritating—if in step one ""profile"" means ""old profile folder,"" then why not say so?   But the big problem is that, with the warning that Firefox must be closed down, I closed FF.  
</p><p>Then I came across this:
</p><p>Open your profile folder:
From the Help menu, choose Troubleshooting Information. The Troubleshooting Information tab will open.
Under the Application Basics section, click on 
Show in Finder
. A window will open that contains your profile folder.
</p><p>Well, these instructions forced me to open Ff again—but to my dismay, when I went to the Application Basics section, and looked at Show in Finder, it wasn't my old profile that showed, but my new one.   Since I only found my old profile picture in the first place by following the same instructions to go to Application Basics when I was told to make a copy of the old profile, which was at that time my current profile, I only got to that profile because it opened automatically—I didn't remember the path, so I don't know how to find it.   But since I did make a copy of it to my external hard drive, I opened my Old Profile from there.
</p><p>Then this:
Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click Quit Firefox.
</p><p>So I quit FF.  
</p><p>Then this:
Hold down the control key while you click on a file you want to copy and choose Copy.
Open the new Firefox profile folder.
</p><p>I found this confusing; why in the world would I be told to click on a file to copy before I was told to open the new profile?   And where WAS the new profile?   
</p><p>So I opened FF again, went to Application Basics, and then opened the new profile, then closed FF again.
</p><p>So I was once more at this step:
</p><p>Hold down the control key while you click on a file you want to copy and choose Copy.
</p><p>But it occurred to me that, rather than repeat this step for each individual item, why not just drag the first sub-folder from the Old Profile to the New One?   I tried that, but got a message saying that the folder was invisible, so I selected everything in that folder and just dragged it into the new profile.
</p><p>I clicked on everything in the second sub-folder in the Old Profile, but when I dropped the selection in the New Profile, I got a message saying that there were copies, so I stopped.   Since I didn't know why there were two sub-folders in the Old Profile, I thought that, in order to make sure that everything from the Old Profile Folder was in the NPF, I created two sub-folders in the NPF, one entitled ""0 untitled"" and the other ""O untitled 2.""   Then I selected and dragged everything that I had transferred from the first sub-folder of the OPF into the NPF *before* I had created sub-folders for the NPF, and I dragged them into ""0 untitled.""   Then I revisited the second sub-folder of the OPF, selected its contents, then dragged and dropped them into the NPF sub-folder ""0 untitled 2.""   
</p><p>When I got to the section ""Your important data and their files,"" I was a little confused, because at first I thought I had to transfer these manually because they were not in the OPF, so I searched for them, but when I selected the ""places.sqlite"" and tried to drag and drop it, I got a message asking whether I wished to delete the file from the Cloud—since I didn't, I didn't.   Finally it occurred to me that perhaps they were in the OPF, so I looked, and they were.
</p><p>The article ends without any instructions as to what to do once you have finished transferring files from the OPF to the NPF, so I simply clicked on FF, which opened without the data.   I closed FF, then shut down and restarted my computer, but when I opened FF, still no data.   
</p><p>I thought perhaps that I had been wrong to drag and drop, so I opened the copy of my OPF on my external hard drive, then opened FF again t the Application Basics so that I could open the NPF in the finder.  When the NPF opened, I was surprised to see that the two sub-folders no longer had the titles I gave them, but had rather the strange string of numbers and letters reminiscent of the names of the invisible folders in the OPF.   
</p><p>Should I create another new profile folder and then go through the laborious process of selecting one file, clicking copy, then going into the NPF, without the sub-folders, and then click ""Paste""?  If I do that for one sub-folder from the OPF, should I create a first sub-folder for the NPF, and then put all the laboriously transferred files from the first sub-folder of the OPF into the new first sub-folder of the NPF, and then repeat that process when I transfer the files laboriously one by one from the second sub-folder of the OPF into the NPF?   
</p><p>I am at a loss, and would appreciate help.

En realidad esta addon sigue funcionando y hace correctamente su función básica, que es descargar archivos.

</p><p>Puesto en contacto con los desarrolladores de esta app parece que el problema está en que la app no es compatible con las actualizaciones de Firefox. En definitiva que me veo obligado a cambiar de navegador y mantener una versión antigua del Firefox para poder usar el Ant Video Downloader como a mí me gusta. No como me obliga Firefox a usarlo.

Chrome and Safari are not having this issue.","<p>I recently had a font management program affect the fonts on my computer in an unexpected and unwanted manner. Immediately after this happened Firefox was no longer rendering type correctly on a number of webpages. Some were completely compromised with ""Last Resort"" (i.e., rounded boxes with question marks for each character) replacing all text, and some with only certain portions affected. At the time I did not check other browsers to see if/how they were affected.
</p><p>I replaced/reinstalled the Mac system fonts, and reinstalled around 90% of the additional fonts that I've collected over the years, however, Firefox was still having issues. At this point I uninstalled Firefox and pulled down a fresh copy, cleared all caches, and checked both Chrome and Safari. Firefox is still not working correctly and the other two browsers show no sign of the problem (if they ever had it all). Attached are screen shots of my My Yahoo! page in Chrome and Firefox showing the results of the issue.

1264562,2019-07-13 15:21:55 UTC,2019-07-18T06:07:04Z,The star icon menu is clunky,"<p>I switched to Firefox a couple of years ago when Quantum came out. I'm satisfied with it but the main reason I keep using it is grounded on ethics rather than usability (which is fine for me but won't win the stone hearts of more cynical users :-)  ). I had this sort of superficial opinion: ""Chrome is better, but I don't want to use it."" Today I wanted to give Chromium another try. I thought about what it is that makes it better and figured out it almost completely boils down to the star icon functionality: I'm a heavy bookmarks user and Firefox makes me slow, compared to Chrome.
</p><p>First, it doesn't use the latest location in which I saved a bookmark as a default (this was also requested, not by me, on <a href=""http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;p=14770920)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;p=14770920)</a>. I often add a row of pages to a single bookmarks folder, but rather than selecting the tabs and adding all of them at once by dragging and dropping as Firefox allows, I prefer to check them on by one: add one, close it, take a look at the one that follows, either close it right away or add it, and so on. In Chrome it's done with a couple of shortcuts in quick succession, in Firefox its much clunkier because one needs to set the directory every time.
</p><p>Then a really annoying and sort of antiquated-feeling characteristic of Firefox's star icon menu and bookmarks sidebar is that type-ahead motion in it (when I type the first letters of the name I want to move to) breaks on spaces. This kind of motion is the only one that is practical once one has a few hundred directories, but if I have a list of directories like ... ""The Rolling Stones"", ""The Who""... I can only match up to ""The"" then I'm on my own.
</p><p>These flaws slow down the menial job of adding bookmarks a lot. Other things that could bring an improvement in my opinion would be an ""Open in folder"" context menu item for bookmarks search results, and the possibility to restrict searches to defined folders. I think what I've described should be done natively and not by extensions.
</p><p>Keep up the good work and thanks for what you do.

This used to allow me to run multiple Firefox windows with different profiles using bash scripts that were all symlinks to the same file. Today I find that if I want to use multiple profiles simultaneously, I have to
1. Use about:profiles to get the profile manager
2. Find the profile I need
3. Click a button to start a new window with the profile I need.
Compared to running a bash script, this takes a lot more time. I don't see a good reason for trading the command line option for this new system.
After reading the documented command line options at
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options</a>
it appears that I'm supposed to use ""-new-instance"". However, I never had to do that before the most recent update. After some experimentation, It appears that ""-new-instance"" is ignored. After looking around, it appears that the latest Firefox update broke ""-p"" on macOS. A workaround is to use ""-no-remote -P"", but I'm left wondering why the need to break something that has worked for many years.

</p><p>I'm pretty good with computers but haven't delved into the nuances of userChrome.css, and I *think* that's where my solution lies.
</p><p>Background: due to something I can't nail down in my security settings, the Instapaper plugin isn't able to function as intended, but I discovered that I was able to get the Javascript bookmarklet to behave. Good deal--one less plugin to drain my system. HOWEVER, I'm one of those nerds who keeps oft-used links in the toolbar with the text removed. That means this link has the generic globe for an icon--and I really want the Instapaper I as a visual cue.
</p><p>I've been digging around online trying to find the solution, but while I've gotten as far as determining that I need to tell FF what icon to use in a userChrome.css file--none of the info I'm finding quite matches up with the variables I have to provide. I don't understand how to specify the bookmarklet without using the name field (as it's blank). When I try using the full Javascript string bad things happen, and I'm not sure how to explain wildcards within the context so I could just use ""<a href=""http://instapaper.com"" rel=""nofollow"">instapaper.com</a>"" or something.
</p><p>I am so frustrated by this seemingly easy task! Plus, I'm used to being able to do some searching and sort things out. Not this time... brain hurts! Can someone please show me what the code snippet to accomplish this looks like? 
</p><p>I don't care if the ICO is remote or sits in the chrome folder locally.

I switch back to Tab 1, the text box has lost focus. I type characters and they go into space. I have to click on the box before entering text.

If it's not YouTube's fault, then is there a way I can fix this at all, so that no videos show the greyed-out padlock?

Firefox say: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost/... (Reason: CORS request did not succed). Problem is firefox doesn't send OPTION request to web api. So server part is not in game. When I change address to web api to https, firefox sends OPTION request. 
IE, Edge, Chrome, Opera works fine. Problem is firefox only. Why? How can I change settings to send ajax request to http when web application is on https? I cannot change web api to https! 
I try send request through XMLHttpRequest in javascript. I tried to set up security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false but nothing change. I tried to add &lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""upgrade-insecure-requests"" /&gt; tag into page but nothing change. 
When I downgrade application to http it works fine. So I think there should not be problem on server side. There are following headers on server side:
""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""*""
""Access-Control-Allow-Methods"", ""POST, OPTIONS, GET""
""Access-Control-Allow-Headers"", ""Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, x-requested-with""
</p><p><br>
There is function which is in web application:
function SendData(url, data, handler) {
</p><pre>       var invocation = new XMLHttpRequest();
       invocation.open(""POST"", url, true);
       invocation.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json;charset=UTF-8"");
       invocation.onreadystatechange = function () {
           if (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200)
               handler(invocation.responseText, this.status);
       }
       invocation.send(data);
   }

It only happens when opened the html-files locally. If you upload the same files to a webserver, everything works fine. With 67.0.4 (and all previous versions) the website works fine both ways.

There seems no way out of this except to switch off the PC and reboot.
This only happens in normal mode, web pages display normally in Safe Mode.
Tried Refreshing Firefox, disabling all Plugins, disabling hardware acceleration; I have no Themes or Extensions; new Profile - none make any difference.
When the map starts to load, it gets to the point where text (i.e. place names) are rendered but the text is garbled and then the monitor goes to sleep.
Any ideas anything else I can try? Can I somehow debug the rendering of the map?
Or am I resigned to always using Firefox in Safe Mode - does this matter anyway?

</p><p>I do not want my ""AUTOFILL"" being used, yet FIREFOX BUILT IN TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ON!
</p><p>I also use CC Cleaner and it exposed a MAJOR SECRET BUG IN FIREFOX and you can NOT TURN OFF AUTOFILL!
</p><p>The ""Fake"" autofill is reset to always be ON, and if you try to actually Block it, your FF will reboot back to AUTOFILL ON!
</p><p>You can got to Security and  select ""Autofill"" to be off, but its a FACT, IT STAYS ON!  A 2nd security program states the BROWSER PLUG IN is not Off but On!  When I manually turn it off with a 2nd program, it automatically closes FF and reboots back on with AUTOFILL ON!?
</p><p>So Once I turn on FireFox and my autofill in security says OFF, it actually stays on.  Looking at programs browser plugin in CCleaner, it reverts and says FF Autofill is ON!  When you try to clear it and change it to OFF, you FIREFOX Automatically CLOSES!  Then when you restart FF and look again, CCLeaner says its ON.
</p><p>I was wondering why I'd get the same stuff on pages, and I set my Security Autofill OFF.  So you ""assume"" its off, but if you look close, you'll see stuff you typed yesterday, is still valid.  Yet I reset all cookies and run CCLeaner and several other security programs.
</p><p>So why can't you actually TURN OFF FF ""AUTOFILL""?  Their is a SECRET that forces FF to keep autofill ON, even when you select it to be OFF!   
</p><p>Does anyone else find this scam on, where your computer catches FF Autofill being on, when you select it to be off?
</p><p>So all your typing in FF, you may select Autofill ""Off"", but your computer actually reads that Autofill IN FF as still being ""ON"".
</p><p>So is FF only ""Pretending"" to its users to think your ""autofill"" data is OFF, but ITS ACTUALLY BEING SENT?  If not, why is other security programs picking up on the Autofill typing being sent as ""ON"", inside the actual FF program?   Why would a computer security program reading FF, read the blocked autofill data as being ON, while your FF security controls say its OFF inside the FF Browser?  
</p><p>This opens up your computer to having all your typed data secretly stolen, and if you use your CC or bank info or passwords, they are really be SENT!  What a FF scam....  So was this purposely made or what?
</p><p>I never remember having any ""Autofill"" Plugin, until the last few months.  So is this a new addon, that they use to backdoor into FF and steal all your personal data?

I have been using Firefox on my MacBook since 2012, and been syncing to my Android phones since 2015-ish (a Huawei, then Samsung, then another Samsung, replacing them as they broke). I never had any problems. I can't remember if I was able to access already synced bookmarks from broken phones, but since I move my mobile bookmarks into desktop bookmark folders pretty often, I was never bothered enough to check. Last October, my MacBook's logic board broke. Not long after, my phone broke. I got a secondhand iPhone, and signed into sync, but nothing synced up. I assume because my devices are already dead and no longer syncing? Is there anyway for me to access my laptop bookmarks? I still have the hard drive from the MacBook.
</p><p>I finally have access to a computer again, this time a Windows desktop, and logged in to my Firefox sync to see if I could find any of my disappeared bookmarks. Nope, but something weird happened. I have about 200 bookmarks on my iPhone, and the first 139 migrated to the desktop. They show up under the 'Mobile Bookmarks' folder on the desktop, but I can no longer see them on my iPhone. The most recent 20 or so bookmarks are still available on my iPhone, but don't appear on the desktop. What just happened?

I have chosen Firefox through Custom Programmes (as against 'Non Microsoft) in Win7 and as the default browser in Firefox options (it keeps telling me Firefox is NOT my default browser but won't accept 'Make Firefox my default browser' option). In choosing options for File Associations (in Windows) only Chrome versions are available, and I can neither uncheck those options within Chrome section NOR choose to use Firefox in the Firefox section. I need to keep Chrome available for a few select items so cannot uninstall it. I am desperate. Talk about invasive!

I've recently been experiencing an issue with Ghostery for Firefox version 8.3.4 on Firefox 67.0.4 (and recent versions) on Windows 10. When visiting Twitter or clicking links that lead to pages on Twitter's domain, I am often faced with the ""log in"" page - even though I am already logged in. By bypassing the cache (ctrl+shift+r) I am able to continue to Twitter as normal. Despite Twitter being categorized as a ""trusted"" site in Ghostery, the issue persists. Completely pausing Ghostery also does not resolve the issue. However, when I disable Ghostery, the issue does not occur and I am not forced to bypass the cache when using Twitter. This issue occurs on my laptop PC as well as my desktop (also running Windows 10 and the latest versions of Firefox and Ghostery); both run the same synced Firefox account. This has only recently begun to happen and I am unable to replicate the behavior on any other websites. It seems that Ghostery is the culprit, but it is unclear to me what is causing this odd behavior.

1264110,2019-07-08 03:26:26 UTC,2019-07-10T20:19:50Z,Firefox updates seem to ignore my privacy and security concerns as addons that address them get obliterated during updates.,"<p>This has been a MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ME for me since at least the time Quantum was released.
</p><p>My goal during an update is to be able to continue using the release that is to be replaced until I am satisfied that the new release with its new profile includes as many of the preferences, add-ons, passwords, and other settings that can be carried forward from the previous one as possible (e.g., all that do not cause major conflicts or other serious problems not easily resolved).
</p><p>The majority of the add-ons I use are related to maintaining the privacy, anonymity, security, and integrity of the browser as well as the data which it handles or manages.  Quite a few are redundant so I usually have several installed but disabled at any given time.
</p><p>From my perspective It makes little sense to enable Firefox to send anything to Mozilla (e.g., allow Firefox to phone home) before I am reasonably sure the new installation of Firefox is running well, with the same or a similar set of security and privacy add-ons in place, especially when I was not made very aware that enabling this would make restoring the add-ons I cherish easier in some way.
</p><p>Storage is dirt cheap these days.  Even on this laptop, I can add another 2TB of fast SSD storage via an external port, then move at least a 1TB of stuff off the 1TB internal SSDs -- in other words, I like the idea of having the option of making a complete backup of the entire existing Firefox  Beta release I have been using with all of its pointers to my data on this system, other systems, in the cloud, etc.  before letting the installer create the new installation for the upgraded Beta Release.
</p><p>I gather a system reboot (or at least a browser restart would be in order at this point.  After that, it would be wonderful if I was presented the option of migrating all of my old preferences, other settings, and passwords to new profile of the new installation.  I doubt many of the add-ons I use are so obscure that they would not get tested by at least a few people doing QA for the upgrade so if any might pose problems, I could be told they could not be migrated with the rest that can be carried forward in a routine manner.  (Specific instructions as to how to handle the exceptions would be nice.  Some hints about why the particular add-on does not play well with the upgrade would give users a place to start investigating.)
</p><p>What bugs me the most is that I am dead in the water until the add-ons that I use to block a shit-ton of tracking, fingerprinting, and other kinds of cookies, as well as those used by outright malware disservices found on some sites are in place to make the Web a much safer place for me and the things I use it for.
</p><p>I completely understand why the upgrades to the first releases of Firefox Quantum required most users to re-install most addons and set most of their preferences, but after a major release upgrade or three to Quantum, things should be back to a lot more automated routine that preserves the functionality the user had in the previous release as much as is realistically feasible when the new release is installed in its own separate place with its own profiles, thus giving the user the fall back option of continuing to use the old release until the new one is tweaked enough to be workable for the user.
</p><p>Remember: if you do not want to shed users because they get tired of having to restore things from scratch and perhaps losing a lot of important data or functionality along the way, you have to give them as clear and reliable means as possible of getting from where they where (presumably) somewhat satisfied with the old release to as good or better level of satisfaction with the new release, without making them jump through a lot of difficult hoops or perform what seem to be several arcane rituals.
</p><p>In short, the default process should be to carry forward as many add-ons and user preferences as possible during an upgrade (given the user the option to start from scratch if he likes clean installs or happens to be enough of a masochistic geek to want to go through setting up two dozen add-ons and many specific settings).  On occasion, I will put of with the painful process of cleaning the junk out of an old browser or system configuration, but usually I try to do that as part of routine housekeeping and like it when what should be a simple system or browser upgrade does not end up seeming like going through a full tax audit.
</p><p>Regards,
TMG

This is despite the fact that we only have one version of Firefox installed and some computers have the -release profile whereas others don't for some reason.
</p><p>I am aware that a number of people have reported this. However, it's not clear if this is a bug where there is only one version of Firefox installed or intended result.
</p><p>My main question is going forward will Firefox be using the -release format or the .default profile?
In other words, was there a bug in a Firefox version causing it to create a -release profile even if there if there was only one Firefox version installed or is it just a case of some computers have not phased in the new profile name yet. This would explain the inconsistencies between computers.
</p><p>The reason that this is a problem is because I use a script to install ublock origin and also to copy a user.js preferences file to configure Firefox. I am now having to copy to both -release and .default profiles on every computer and I have designed the script to install ublock to a -release profile.
</p><p>I would prefer to have one profile moving forward, but need to know whether this will be .default-release or simply .default.  Thank you

</p><p>There is a single profile that resides on the Win10 SSD that the Linux installs can see, via mounting the Win10 partition. Up until recently, V56 of Firefox was working fine, except for the usual bugbears of huge memory usage etc. Now with some free time, I've decided to finish off the hard disk -&gt; SSD transition. I now have a problem with PW's being ""lost"". Bear in mind all three installs are seeing the same ONE profile.

Win10 - V64 can read/display the passwords correctly and log me into sites.
Linux - V64 CAN NOT display the passwords hence can't log me into sites.

- what is retained on FF servers, 
- how can parts (eg passwords) be removed from FF servers, or from one of the devices?
- what is overwritten in the synced profiles
- what happens to conflicting settings
- what determines which setting will prevail in the case of a conflict
- how to remove unwanted tabs/settings which have been synced
- what determines which bookmarks/passwords/tabs/addons end up where?
- what determines which addon settings prevail if there is a conflict?
- are addons settings even synced?
- does it change tabs order?  If so, what determines the order?
-Does it ADD tabs to both devices, does it REMOVE tabs?
- does it retain containers?
- how do you update a sync and ensure up to date data is transferred?
- on a device, eg iphone, what is the procedure to switch between different synced profiles without getting them mooshed up together?
- etc etc.

I would like to ask you for a help with downgrading of the user profile.
I have updated to the latest FF69b2, but it has too much bugs, app freezes, pages are loading exptremely slowly, ajax doesn't work properly.
Therefore I want to go back to the FF68b14, but I can't, FF68b14 says that the profile was already used by a newer version.
The only option is to create a new profile. I would like to try it anyway. 
Do you know where is the version number of the profile stored? I tried to replace all ""68.0"" within prefs.js but it didn't help.
There should be possible to go back to the previous version, or the user has to be informed about irreversible conversion of the profile, which isn't this case I believe.

Why is this? I've tried doing the sessionstore-backups trick but that doesn't work. Unless it can be explained otherwise, this seems to me to be bad update execution, which is a defect. That I have to go to a third-party URL to have it extract my old URLs from my previous session is a workaround to a problem that the team should highly prioritize fixing. This is a good measure of a problem - if someone has developed a website to address a problem, then the application is not sufficiently addressing the problem. Also if the app is going to completely wipe user settings, the user should be notified beforehand.

The application will load completely in other web browsers, i.e. Explorer, Chrome, so it's not a problem with the app. All my add-ons are up to date, Firefox is up to date (67.0.4) as of today's date (07/04/19). Firefox Quantum is running on a Windows 10 64 bit Desktop PC. So my question is, what else is happening when Firefox starts in Safe Mode, besides disabling all add-ons, setting theme to default, and turning off Hardware Acceleration? Because whatever else it's doing, fixes the problem. FYI: The application that I'm trying to load is GSN Casino from Facebook (and before suggesting that the problem may be Facebook, or GSN related, remember, the problem doesn't occur on other browsers). Thanks in advance for any help that you can provide.

Once installed, if removed, then it adds it automatically.","<p>We are using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) as a portal for Guest Wireless.  We have installed a certificate signed by Entrust (All of our certificates are signed by Entrust).  
</p><p>We opened each certificate (server, intermediate and root) for the Guest Wireless portal and verified the chain of trust by matching the Subject Key Identifier (SKI) of each certificate to the Authority Key Identifier (AKI) of the next certificate in the chain.  We placed the Intermediate and Root in the proper place in Cisco ISE as well as the Server Certificate.  We also opened a case with Cisco TAC to verify that everything on the Cisco ISE server was configured correctly.    
</p><p>Here is the problem we are having:
When a user is using Edge, Chrome or IE as their default browser, the portal presentation page shows a valid certificate.  When a user is using the latest version of Firefox as their default browser, they get a non secure certificate warning if they have never visited a site that uses the same Entrust Intermediate certificate.  If a user has previously visited a site with the same Intermediate certificate then they get a valid certificate.  We verified that the user that gets a non secure certificate warning has the Entrust Root certificate in the ""Authorities"" section of Certificate Manger.  
</p><p>The Intermediate certificate does not appear to get installed in the Firefox browser when the user first connects to the portal.  We manually imported the Intermediate certificate and the page loads with a valid certificate.  We then go into the options settings and remove the Intermediate certificate, close all open browsers, reload the windows 10 workstation, connect to the portal and the page shows a secure certificate.  When we look in the ""Authorities"" section of Certificate Manger the Intermediate certificate is listed.       
</p><p>My question is, why do we have to manually install the Intermediate certificate for this to work in Firefox?

</p><p>A few weeks ago I logged into an online account (Strava) and noticed an unfamiliar email in the suggestion box that appears below the email entry box when an email is entered. I ignored it at the time but recently logged into Facebook and saw the same email in the list of remembered login emails. I found the person who owns the unfamiliar email address through my university’s internal lookup service; I have never met the person and I never let anyone access my computer without my knowledge and consent. I am concerned that this person could somehow be accessing my Firefox account and/or other online accounts and the rest of the data on my machine. Is this concern valid given what I’ve noticed? Under what circumstances will Firefox remember an email address so it can be suggested at a later login (ie, does someone have to log in to the particular device being used, or is there another circumstance in which Firefox could remember a login email?) If my concern is valid, what should I do?  Note that I have never had Sync enabled, to my knowledge.

So what I really want to do is merge the changes I have made to my login info since the power surge into the login info I had before the power surge.  I have kept bookmarks I made since the power surge in a separate folder on the new system.
</p><p>Is there a way to run both the old FF and the new FF in separate accounts on the new Win 7 system?   And would that allow me to export login info and bookmarks between the versions of FF?

Recently I had to do some cleaning and downloaded a few important MS updates. I am very selective as to what updates I will install.
</p><p>Then my previously stable FF started hanging. For backup I can run Chrome portable but even that wouldn't run. I tried to stop the Firefox.exe service and it would not go away without a reboot. This is a particularly nasty problem and the most offered solution is to stop hardware acceleration, which didn't work for me. Then I discovered parent.lock file in the profile and with an unlock app I could eventually kill FF.
</p><p>I did a clean re-install after searching and finding all those Mozilla files in the system folders and registry entries (why no app to do this?). After a clean re-install with the default profile, the lockup problems would come back. I even tried installing a 32 bit version with the same result.  I eventually solved my problem without a solution anywhere!
</p><p>Go to Windows programs and features, then turn on windows features and despite the warning, I turned off Internet Explorer 11. OK I accept that some MS update or newer version of MS Internet Explorer might have solved my problem, but this worked for me and took a long time to find. I also accept an up to date version of FF may work differently with better security, but I like my old version and the 3rd party addons that aren't compatible with new versions. 
</p><p>Now if I watch the Firefox.exe process (there are sometimes 2 or 3) they go away at every shut down and Chrome my backup, which doesn't use a lock file, works in an emergency for any sites needing higher security

Importantly, I am talking about the search box at <a href=""http://Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Google.com</a>, *not* the Firefox search box (the issue does *not* occur when I use the latter).  It's kind of like what you see happen to the screen when activating the Windows Snipping tool, before taking  the snip, though not quite *that* faded.
</p><p>In the attached image, the left half is *without* the cursor positioned in the search box, and the right half -- which shows the fading -- is *with* the cursor positioned in the search box for typing. 
</p><p>Some points: (1) This does not happen when using Google Search in Chrome or IE. (Firefox is my default browser, BTW.)  (2)  This does not happen on either of my other two Windows 7 pc's, which also use Firefox 60.7.2esr (32-bit).
(3) Disabling add-ons by using Safe Mode doesn't change the behavior.
(4) Disabling Hardware Acceleration doesn't change the behavior.
</p><p>My main concern with this behavior is in case it indicates the possibility of some kind of malware.  My secondary concern is whether it might indicate some other current or potential problem with my system, although I haven't noticed any other issues thus far.  Other than that, I don't mind the behavior, as it doesn't slow me down or prevent me from accomplishing anything.

In my mind Firefox stands for a free Internet. But it seems so fade to ""Firefox stands for a leftist Internet"".
</p><p>We got Pocket and moz://a 3 years ago and it's horrible.
As an official Firefox-Feature I would expect Pocket to be political neutral. 
But (At least here in Germany) from the Big Newspapers you get only to see the ones who are clearly leaning left in Pocket. Never saw a conservative article in Pocket, and I look at it pretty much every day because I am too lazy to remove it from my phone. (Although on my PC I have removed it).
Germany is pretty balanced with about 50% Conservatives and 50% progressives in it's population. Still, Pocket is obviously biased towards the left.
</p><p>Do I have to begin with moz://a ? 
Yeah, some articles are for Internet-Freedoms. Thats totally okay because It is how Firefox works. A FREE Internet.
But not a left one. Still we get Articles like 
<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/change-makers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/change-makers/</a>
(Considering Stuff like Black Lives Matter for your ""Brand Identity"" which is pretty much the same as promoting the klu klux klan.
They are violent, their leaders say in public they want the ""white race eradicated"" etc. I just can't believe you support Extremist groups.)
</p><p>Nothing against casual lefts. But I don't wan't every product I use politized. Neither Right nor Left.
I just want a product doing what it should do.
</p><p><br>
So, As I am not really involved in the background processes of Firefox, please tell me if Firefox now became officially left. Because then I have to search myself a new browser and stop my business donating to it.
