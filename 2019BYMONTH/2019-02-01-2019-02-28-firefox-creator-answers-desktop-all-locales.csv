Nothing in the Foxfire troubleshooting section has addressed this issue. This is the only site that I have had a problem with. Do you have any suggestions?

</p><p>I'd like to know if firefox supports an equivalent to <a href=""https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#AutoSelectCertificateForUrls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#AutoSelectCertificateForUrls</a>.
</p><p>Essentially I have a web app client that connects to multiple servers. For each server it needs to provide a client certificate. I know FF allows to save the answer after selecting the certificate via dialogue but the issue is that I have 1...N  servers and that can get really annoying for the user. I'd like something like chromes AutoSelectCertificateForUrls that allows me to set a regex url pattern for cert selection without prompting the user that I can push a s a configuration to all enterprise users. Is there something I can use for FF that would suit?

Either manually, or with an add-on. Any ideas/help on this topic will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

</p><p>My usage habit is basically I've usually got hundreds of tabs up on a few different windows up to sometimes 10. Memory seems to creep up with browsing and doesn't really seem to go down even if I close a large number of tabs or whole windows now. A while back there was another version that would leak but it got fixed (within the quantum releases not the really old memory leak that was super bad.) Just wondering if maybe this version has a leak as well. 
</p><p>Side note: I DO love the crash recovery, because it works better than anything else. If I try to close all windows and then relaunch and restore session it never seems to recover everything. But if I crash it via task manager on purpose it has near 100% ability to restore. I'd rather not have to do it that way but it's what works. I'm a very heavy user and outside the norm a bit.

It never restarts.

1251520,2019-02-27 14:41:06 UTC,2019-03-01T15:41:15Z,Unresponsive menus render on top after waking from sleep,"<p>First off, I'm running 65.0.1 on Windows 10 on a new laptop I purchased in the last month. I'm having trouble figuring out how to describe the issue I'm having, and I'm not sure if I have all of the terminology correct. I've tried searching for others with similar issues and haven't found this particular problem.
</p><p>The problem I am having occurs occasionally after waking from sleep. On some (but not all) windows, certain menu elements will render on top of my screen and will be unresponsive. For example, this most commonly occurs with the address bar drop down suggestions, but also occurs with permission boxes such as requesting location access. I believe I have also seen it happen with the downloads box (what comes up when clicking the down arrow, not the separate window that comes up with Ctrl+J).
</p><p>When the problem occurs, these elements render on top of the screen and block anything behind them. They are also unresponsive to any input. They will persist in the same location on screen that they initially appeared, and will not move with the window if I move the window to another part of the screen. For example, the address bar takes up the full width of the screen when maximized. If the suggestions box gets stuck across the whole screen, then moving the window to fill half of the screen doesn't cause the stuck element to resize as well. 
</p><p>These stuck elements are also specific to the particular Firefox window, and do not render over top of a separate window or other applications. It is also possible for them to stack, as I have had the suggestions box and a permissions box stuck simultaneously.
</p><p>I can get them to go away a few ways. One is to re-activate the element, which allows me to interact with it normally, at which point it will disappear when it should. For example, if the address bar suggestions are stuck on top, I can start typing in the address bar. This causes new suggestions to pop up, at which point I can interact with it normally again, and it will disappear as it normally would (such as after selecting a suggestion or cancelling out). Sometimes this is more difficult, though, as in the example with the location permission box. I would have to go to a website that triggers that box to appear, at which point I can interact with it and close it by selecting either option on it. At this point it is easier to clear the stuck box the second way, which is to close and reopen the entire window. When the specific window that the UI element is tied to closes, it will also disappear.
</p><p>I've noticed this occurs after putting my laptop to sleep and then waking it back up. It doesn't happen consistently, however, and I can't quite figure out what other conditions are necessary to replicate it.

After downloading it and getting set up ,and telling my security programs to consider it a friend,  I noticed that Firefox loads a skeleton of a webpage, almost always . By skeleton , I mean very few pics, very few active links, just text. Blank spots where the thumbnails, links, and pics should be. Also on pages that do load and display photos, they disappear when the cursor is placed over them  . Some webpages are still useable, others are not, due to this swiss cheese effect.  Everything it decided to blank would fall into the ""potential threat"" category, so I did some reading, and experimented with clearing history , and unchecking the boxes blocking cookies and trackers, just to see if I could pinpoint the problem and allow the trusted sites or pages past it's filter. I had little success, and cannot really see myself living with the abbreviated versions of every webpage  , which I don't think is what the huge majority ofFirefox users are relegated to . I just can't find that magic setting , and not due to lack of time or effort spent looking . I'd appreciate any help offered.

Here's where it gets weird.  It's not in Firefox's list of extensions!  Since McAfee loaded it on my computer, I contacted their tech support, asking it how I could load it onto my wife's Firefox browser.   I was told the extension was for Chrome and they didn't make one for Firefox.  I spent several minutes trying to tell the tech their Web Boost loaded into Firefox, the icon is there among my extensions, and the damn thing works.  All the tech could do was load the extension into Chrome, which my wife hadn't uninstalled from her machine.

Recently I switched my family to Linux like I had a while back and there was a complaint about the file chooser (GTK) that Firefox on Linux uses, and after a decent amount of searching we were unable to find a way to change it.
It is a nice file chooser but it is lacking an option to have a thumbnail view instead of just a list view which makes some of my family's browsing harder than normal (picking images for things like Ebay).
</p><p>I was curious if there was a way to change the view of the file chooser, or replace the file chooser with the native file manager (Nemo in this case).
</p><p>Thank you for your time :)

Firefox recognizes the PIV card and asks for my PIN when I go to the site I'm trying to access, but is never actually able to authenticate.  I believe that this is because the PIV card has multiple identities on it (I know this for certain), and the one I want is the second one; I suspect firefox is defaulting to the first one, for which I do not have the PIN.  Is there a way to get firefox to allow me to choose which PIV identity I want to to use?

Since then Firefox will open ok, and will view all pages ok with the exception of Youtube videos and Firefox support pages both of which crashes a tab when I try and access them.  I have already tried clearing firefox caches, refreshing firefox, and have done a reinstall of firefox.  The problems remain exactly the same. I have searched high and low for a solution but can find nothing relevant. All of the pages that crash Firefox work fine in Edge.

Ubuntu/Xubuntu 18.04.1/18.04.2 LTS
</p><p>Non-affected OSes:
Windows 10
</p><p>Browser:
Firefox latest stable version and some previous versions at least back to when Ubuntu 18.04.1 was out.
</p><p>Machines:
Intel Core i5, desktop PC, either using a GPU card or the integrated one.
Asus X553M, notebook
</p><p>Problem:
Firefox is very slow when loading a given host for the first time, e.g. <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a>
After it's done loading, browsing on that domain is ok.
Please watch the video (it's on <a href=""http://veoh.com"" rel=""nofollow"">veoh.com</a>) since it's the best way to understand the problem.
<a href=""https://vimeo.com/319319274"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/319319274</a>
Some text and web pages content are in italian because of the geolocalization.
In the video I use VirtualBox for recording convenience but it's the same behaviour in the host machine.
</p><p>Tried:
Everything (Ubuntu clean install, reset Firefox profile, proxy settings, disable hardware acceleration, disabling/removing all plugins and extensions, connect to cable - no router).
</p><p>Important:
Chromium and Opera work fine.
Therefore this is obviously a bug in Firefox. Of course it may only happen under very specific hardware / network combinations, otherwise one thousand people would lament this problem. So I'm open to give additional information.

</p><p>These other websites turned out to be websites I had bookmarked and was reviewing (visiting) yesterday.  However, these particular bookmarked websites are certainly not ""most-visited"".  These bookmarked websites ended up replacing true most-visited websites in this list.
</p><p>Previously, I experienced that my most-visited list was simply that, with the website visited the most (over a number of days (?)) at the top followed by the second-most-visited website, etc.  Since this list only appears to allow 10 entries, that worked for me.  Thus Google search was at the top of the list as I visit it multiple times/day.
</p><p>Now it appears that if I visit a bookmarked website a small number of times in a day it ends up in this list bumping down true most-visited websites .. until the most-visited websites fall out of this 10-entry list -- indeed, Google search no longer even appeared in the list this morning!
</p><p>How can I make this list a true most-visited list again?
</p><p>When I put my cursor on the little down-caret symbol in the toolbar that displays this list it reads ""show history"".  If there's a settings entry for this function I can't find it.  I can't even find a setting that controls the number of days to set to analyze if a website is most used or not.

Recently I had my Dell Laptop completely gone thru by a Dell Premium Support person because I felt it was time. They found a lot of problems with missing components and/or ones that needed updating. They also removed several items from the hard drive that were either spying / gathering information. After they were finished and gave the computer back to me, I found that NO SCRIPT (which I had been using for a couple of years) had been deleted. Today I tried to re-install NO SCRIPT and Firefox blocked my attempt to install it. There was no reason given for this blocking, altho NO SCRIPT is still listed as an available ADD-ON?????? Can someone explain why this is happening. I am a 81yo self taught PC user and do not understand a lot of the terminology used in the field of computers.  Thanx for any help....DON

I have it dark now but now it still flashes BRIGHT WHITE for a second before loading black.  This shouldnt be so convoluted to fix.  By the way, dark/black should be the default theme for every browser on planet earth.  It would save millions from eyestrain/damage from harmful blue LED light from computer monitors and phone screens.  Ive already selected default Dark Theme under themes.  I tried the extension, Dark Background with Light Text.  It now has interference from my custom css file I created, and wont work properly.   Furthermore I cant change the new tab background on torbrowser either which is based off of firefox.  Come on FF fix this nonsense, make customizing a theme EASY.  its the simplest part of a website, the styling.

</p><p>To live with this annoyance, at home I'd take some addon to generate a new random String of some 16+ Characters and enter it in the password field. There you go, good, safe and secure for another 3 month.
</p><p>But on sending the login-form at work Firefox does not ask me to save the password. What's wrong? I was reading up and down the Internet until I found the culprit: in about:config the key signon.rememberSignons is ""locked"" to false and I cannot reenable it. WTF?
</p><p>Mozilla is giving out advice on how to memorize passwords instead of saving them in a password-manager. And at the same time Mozilla puts anti-features in the browser for the IT-department to disable my password-manager, that I became so dependent on?
</p><p>You know where this leads:
- I take the very same password everywhere now.
- And because I have to type it every time: it's nice and short and
- it happens to be found in an ordinary dictionary, as surprise the keyboard layout was designed, to support typing natural words.
- Finally the last letter is a single digit, as I am forced to integrate a digit anyway, so why not let it be the last one
- Oh how nice ... the reminder popped up to tell me, I have to change my password again ... so I add one to the counter, that happens to be so conveniently integrated into the password
- Even, when I come across an old outdated account, I only need 10 tries, to crack my own password - I must recommend this as a fail-safe to all my colleagues!
</p><p>Of course I cannot expect of you to answer my question about stupid IT-department. They will only open an information-request-ticket, that will automatically timeout after two weeks. I already tried this.
</p><p>No, my question to you is: When will you remove the anti-feature for company-admins to take their greedy fingers off of my Firefox configuration?
</p><p>I don't want them to hide some configuration in the windows registry, where I am not allowed to alter it.
I don't want to be locked out of my profile including about:config
I don't want my password-manager crippled.
I don't want to be nannied, that I'm not allowed to install a password generator addon.
</p><p>BTW: What is more harmful:
- Collecting my personal password-manager files protected by a long oligarch-password from my encrypted hard drive.
- Cracking the weak password I was driven into using or just phishing it from a single fake-site I happily typed it into, as I am so used to typing it everywhere multiple times per day.
</p><p>PS: Don't take me wrong. I'm very pleased with Firefox even although I got shocked by loosing lots of addons during the transition to webextension (now I understand the necessity to go-on in development). This is not meant to offend. I'm frustrated, that I met a dead end with my IT-department ... and sad to find out Mozilla collaborates with them ...

</p><p>I'm a little angry right now because I have lost bookmarks of all my life and I need your help to repair it please?
I don't know why but somehow,  Firefox which I use for years ; (Thx by the way) ; corrupted my data on the run...?
I started Firefox again but, no extension, no bookmarks, etc.. I Have kept a backup of all this FF profile, just in case.
</p><p>My 1st step was to try to get a new profile a import my previous data from Firefox Sync - but somehow , I'm angry at myself again for not understanding how FF Sync work, no data from FFSync  updated my data - It stayed like this for a long time , like a new profile without data (I used Xmarks before so I thought it was replacing it).
</p><p>2nd step: I tried to load all bookmarks-xxx.jsonlz4 located in the bookmarkbackups folder from the FF bookmarks tools (Import / export ; etc). FF seems to see all the bookmarks but can't load them. What is really important here is that FF backed up files for like a month and even my oldest file is unusable  : bookmarks-2019-01-19-xxx.jsonlz4 !!
</p><p>3rd step: I tried to get my data back from FF files, in bookmarks files like bookmarks-2019-01-19-xxx.jsonlz4 from the bookmarkbackups folder. Someone pointed me to use the <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/bookbackreader.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/bookbackreader.html</a> website but all the jsonlz4 files in the bookmarkbackups folder seems corrupted (or the format of files changed and his tool may need to be updated ?)
</p><p>Example : 
File name: bookmarks-2019-01-19_2392_mKZssqkWMZt+Mqt-HOi68A==.jsonlz4; Size: 283114; last modified 18/01/2019 à 12:38:42 (failed JSON parsing: SyntaxError: Unexpected token in JSON at position 21928)
Note: To try a different file, reload this page
Can't seem to acces the step 2 part even after waiting longer
</p><p>4th step: tried to get old Backup of my FF Profiles with Windows 10 Shadow Copy System, ""Shadow Explorer"" or ""System Restore Explorer""
Found 3 backup wich I restored also, all bookmarks seems to get the same problem. I think I'll need to look in to this because It's not official Windows tools, but I'm really disapointed here.. I think I'll put them on md5sum tools to compare them for a start.
</p><p>5th  step : tried to repair my &lt;places.sqlite&gt; a (80MB files) which I found renamed to sqlite.corrupt.
With the help of <a href=""http://www.froebe.net/blog/2015/05/27/error-sqlite-database-is-malformed-solved/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.froebe.net/blog/2015/05/27/error-sqlite-database-is-malformed-solved/</a> , all I can get is a empty database at the end, but Im not a sqlite expert so if anyone has an idea :-)
</p><p>So please,  any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 
</p><p>Thank you. (and sorry for my english)

</p><p>I have used FF for a long time now.  A **LONG** time ago, I could install an addon which is since not supported.
</p><p>Some of the things I miss which I would like to see added to FF:
Although there is now an ""Open in new tab"" option it is still a bit short of offerings.
</p><p>1 - ""Open in new tab and switch""
2 - Add names to tabs.   Sometimes it would be nice to search for a tab with a more appropriate name.
3 - (Though maybe asking a bit too much)   Coloured tabs.    Un-loaded, Loaded but not active, *THIS* tab.
Though *THIS* tab is sort of easy to see, when I am researching something and have a lot of tabs open seeing ""where"" (which) tab is the active one is handy.   
Explination of the three colours:  
--  Un-loaded - (When loading a previous session)  This tab is not yet loaded.
--  Loaded but not active - You have been to this page this time, but it is not the active tab.
--  *THIS* - well, just so it is easy to separate from the other loaded tabs.

</p><p>Currently, I am trying to use SQLite Manager extension for Firefox to try and find a very specific url which I visited around April 15th of last year, which I can remember through many details, but cannot find in my history or remember the name of. I know for a fact that it exists though.
</p><p>I tried using this query, developed from the support thread above, to find what I was looking for
</p><p>SELECT url, datetime(visit_date/1000000,'unixepoch') AS Time
FROM moz_historyvisits, moz_places
WHERE
moz_historyvisits.place_id=<a href=""http://moz_places.id"" rel=""nofollow"">moz_places.id</a>
AND
url LIKE '%<a href=""http://tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tumblr.com</a>%'
ORDER BY Time DESC
</p><p>However, doing so does not provide any dates, it only arranges all of the visits in chronological order. Which is good, but upon searching for the gap in my history using the context of what my normal history shows from that day, it would seem that the blog I am searching for isn't in the location it should be.
</p><p>Currently my hope is to somehow get the Manager to show me the specific dates I visited sites, so I can arrange the list that way and hopefully pull the blog back into a position where I will recognize it by the date I visited it. Otherwise I would like to find a solution, any solution, to figure out what sites I visited that day to find the blog in question, as I do not expect to ever find it using context clues.

I've had a few minor issues with Firefox in the past, but this is by far the most bizarre, and as of yet the only one that's completely broken it. The best way I could describe it is... the tabs bar, where all the open tabs in any given window are located, is usually located ABOVE the search bar, right? Well, the search bar decided to rebel and go to the very top of any windows I have open, effectively merging with the tabs bar, completely breaking the UI and rendering the browser more or less useless. I can almost fix it by just clicking &amp; holding on any open tabs and fidgeting around a bit, but it goes straight back to its usual broken state as soon as I click back into the tab. 
</p><p>FWIW, this only happened once my PC restarted to automatically update Windows at like 2:30 AM or whatever time I set it to, so as far as I can tell I had no direct hand in causing this. Also, as you could probably gather by my previous sentence, I'm using Windows 10, if that matters. Feel free to inquire about anything else, since while I don't mind using Chrome for a bit, I would like this problem to be fixed ASAP since I do prefer Firefox. I've searched around a bit and haven't found anyone else with this exact same issue, so I don't know if it was caused by a Firefox update or what. Also, I would just LOVE to include some screenshots to better explain the problem, but frankly this stupid little upload image button is being real useless right now. The screenshot thing within Firefox apparently doesn't allow you to capture the search bar or open tabs, and when I try to upload a screenshot using a different program, it just endlessly says ""uploading image."" It's just a friggin' .png file, why are you having so much trouble uploading it?! Oh well, I guess today just isn't my day. Regardless, hopefully my explanation of the issue is enough for you to understand what's happening.

</p><p>Plus!

Could you please unlock my account so that I can access my sync account through THAT email, which actually accepts emails as I've tested many times?

</p><p>Attempts to reset password ALWAYS result in an instantaneously displayed (with NO delay or pause) error, ""Email was returned"", and no email message ever gets sent from Mozilla, in inbox or spam.

[previous unresolved incident]
</p><p>This is the EXACT same scenario that I have attempted, but unlike the user mentioned below, who apparently was successful in receiving the reset email from Mozilla, I never received an email message, and Mozilla claims that the ""email was just returned"". All transpiring within the last 30 minutes, this exact same behavior has occurred whether I attempt a reset on the iOS device (iPhone Xs) or on the PC from which I have responded to this follow-up inquiry.
</p><p><br>
Something must be constitutionally wrong here, and I assure you that if any Mozilla email had been successfully delivered to the above ISP account, then spam filters would still have allowed examination of such message for my observation and manipulation.

</p><p>I run multiple nginx vhosts on the same server with different subdomains. Recently I changed them to all using their own different IPv6-addresses. But since then firefox only uses the one IP of the subdomain, which I opened first, regardless, which subdomain I enter. When I restart the browser or wait for some time (like 5 minutes or so), I can choose another, which is also used until firefox is restarted. Even the network analysis tool of firefox tells me, that it uses only one IP-address for the different subdomains, but the DNS-lookup tool of about:network resolves different IP’s. Other browsers like Chrome or Edge still work fine since the change. If you want to help me please send me a private message, so I can provide you some further information like IP-addresses or domain names. Thank you in advance.

</p><p>I've been using CCleaner for several years with no problems, yet since Quantum was released this has been a constant annoying issue. 
</p><p>For you uninformed, what I am referring to is that if you have CCleaner while a Firefox user you must disable (in CCleaner) it's auto-monitoring of Firefox or Firefox will, on every Re-open, ask if you want to restore previous session tabs or start a fresh new session.

Since I have used this monitor I realized i get massive flickering using Firefox. The flickering only seems to appear when on reddit (lesser so twitter and even less on youtube) while scrolling/using videos. When I hover over the video to preview future scenes it REALLY flickers fast and hard. This issue occurs nearly instantly or within one minute and then continues. The only solution I've found is to disable hardware acceleration. This flickering DOES NOT occur on chrome for the limited time I've been using it (1 hour and maybe more now unfortunately)and does not require hardware acceleration to be disabled. This issues also DOES NOT occur while on my old dell monitor or my very old tv. Any ideas or help? Chrome is so much slower and worse than firefox and I do not want to have to use both browsers nor return this new monitor! Thank you.

In the folder there are a bunch of files that constitute the web page when I saved it. I think I just used the default in the Save As... option in an older version of Firefox. Clicking on the files that have a Firefox icon just brings up a jumble of characters with some legible words mixed in.  I think it was an Craigslist job posting. Would I have to get Firefox to recognize the whole folder as a single web page? I am guessing that all the separate files are part of the original web page.

Depending on our needs, etc. the connections may be via http or https.  AND this condition may change in the midst of preparing a device with new firmware or with a new configuration.  
It seems that if a device (by IP address) is accessed via https and then the access mode switches to http, it's no longer possible to connect at all.  This makes one believe that the device has ""bricked"" and starting all over is necessary.  If the same thing happens again, no matter the procedure, it becomes most time-consuming AND frustrating.  It could result in the device being RMA'd or retired.  So this is a serious matter.
</p><p>I have learned that settings can be undone by clearing them.  But this is a not-so-often procedure and is a deviation from real work.

I recently updated from Firefox 60 to 65 and the behaviour was that in the dropdown to the right of the URL bar this would only show addresses I had typed and successfully connected to, now this is showing the full history. 
</p><p>For example, in a clean Firefox with no history, if I had typed ""<a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>"" into the URL bar then navigated around my email account, the only address in that dropdown would have been <a href=""https://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com</a>, now it shows all of the pages I have viewed within gmail. It's only a minor annoyance but I'd prefer the dropdown only show the addresses I've typed rather than everything - and save the history search for when I start typing in it.

</p><p>I’ve got a website called <a href=""http://Doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">Doelshop.nl</a> which raises free donations for charities. This is done through affiliate marketing, someone buys something through my website (I’m just linking through) and 75% of the commission goes to the charity that the buyer chooses. The buyer doesn’t pay anything extra. 
</p><p>PROBLEM with Firefox/Google Chrome 
</p><p>Many charities have applied (because they can get free donations through their users who are already shopping online), recently we have implemented in our system a function where each project can make their own subdomain. 
</p><p>This means, if you have a charity called ABC, you can create <a href=""http://ABC.doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ABC.doelshop.nl</a> and automatically you have selected the ABC charity. Very handy for charities, because it’s easy promotion. 
</p><p>Now here’s the problem, we have bought a SSL wildcard certificate to establish https:// connection for all these subdomains. 
</p><p>BUT, some are typing into their URL boxes: <a href=""http://www.abc.doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">www.abc.doelshop.nl</a> and this CANNOT be certified. Technically it can if we manually insert every subdomain into multiple certificates, which would cost us thousands of dollars. Also our subdomains are not set, new ones are being created all the time. 
</p><p>Both Firefox and Google Chrome now always give an error message when people type in their URL address with ‘www.’. People cannot even reach the website, it gives un <em>unsafe warning</em> and shoppers won’t donate for free to their charity. 
</p><p>We have redirected the ‘www.’ to ‘without www.’ but this doesn’t help. 
</p><p>PLEASE HELP 
</p><p>Is there any way where you could help, for example by listing these sub-subdomains as safe? I can give you any kind of openness to prove there is nothing scammy going on. 
</p><p>I’m willing to change these domain setups towards <a href=""http://Doelshop.nl/abc"" rel=""nofollow"">Doelshop.nl/abc</a> instead of <a href=""http://abc.doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">abc.doelshop.nl</a> but it takes a while. If you could list it as a safe connection in the meantime that would also mean a lot!
</p><p>Instead of using <a href=""http://abc.doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">abc.doelshop.nl</a> for testing, you can use <a href=""https://make-a-wish.doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://make-a-wish.doelshop.nl</a> (working) and <a href=""https://www.make-a-wish.doelshop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.make-a-wish.doelshop.nl</a> (unsafe in your browser)

You might not heard about me and you obviously are certainly interested why you're receiving this particular message, is it right?
I'mhacker who burstyour emailand devices and gadgetstwo months ago.
Never try out to get in touch with me or find me, it is definitely hopeless, considering that I forwarded you an email using YOUR account that I've hacked.
I've build in malware software on the adult videos (porn) site and suppose that you have watched this site to have a good time (you understand what I want to say).
Whilst you have been paying attention to videos, your browser began operating like a RDP (Remote Control) that have a keylogger which granted me permission to access your desktop and webcam.
Afterward, my softgotall info.
You have wrote passwords on the web-sites you visited, I intercepted them.
Of course, you'll be able to modify each of them, or already modified them.
Even so it does not matter, my app updates it every time.
And what did I do?
I generated a backup of the device. Of all files and each contact.
I have managed to create dual-screen videofile. The 1 section shows the film you had been watching (you've a very good preferences, huh...), the second part shows the video from your webcam.
What must you do?
Well, in my opinion, 1000 USD will be a inexpensive amount of money for this very little secret. You will do the deposit by bitcoins (if you do not understand this, try to find “how to buy bitcoin” in any search engine).
My bitcoin wallet address:
&lt;removed&gt;
(It is cAsE sensitive, so just copy and paste it).
Important:
You will have only 2 days to make the payment. (I put an unique pixel to this email, and at this point I understand that you've read through this email).
To trackthe reading of a messageand the actionswithin it, I usea Facebook pixel. Thanks to them. (Anything thatis appliedfor the authorities may helpus.)

I've used Nirsoft's great History Viewer sadly only available for Windows - but I use my Mac far more than my PC and syncing doesn't always work in moving all my browser history from my Mac to my PC.
If there really is nothing there, I'd appreciate very much help from someone with SQL experience - what do I have to do using a DB Browser for SQLite in order to generate the list I'd like.

Some webpages / articles may contain numerous pages, anywhere from 2 to 200. The information I wish to print is often contained in only 1 or 2 or 3 of those numerous pages. When I click PRINT, and then click PRINT a second time the PRINT dialog box opens. In this dialog box there is a section for PRINT RANGE. One of the options under PRINT RANGE is ""Selection"". However, Selection is always greyed out and cannot be used or chosen. There appears to be an old string of questions &amp; responses to this same problem, but that string appears to no longer be a solution. Can you advise if there is a new or current fix as to how I can turn on / activate the Selection option in PRINT RANGE? Thank you.

The proxy signon request is ""The proxy moz-proxy://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx:**** is requesting a username and password...""
To be more precise I have a signon request when I click on a website icon and then I have an additional request when I type the first character in the google search bar (this happens only after the recent updates).
If I try to write something in the URL edit box instead of google search bar I get multiple proxy signon request, quite every typed character!
It's very frustrating... 
The NTLM proxy is not on the same domain of the windows user.
I have tried changing all the possible settings without any effect, I tried to set:
- network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris
- network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris
- network.negotiate-gsslib
- network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris
to the proxy domain without effect and signon.autologin.proxy is set to true.
I have also tried to reset FF and to remove all the plugins but the problem persisted.
Please could you help me to find a solution to this problem? For me should be fine to have the first proxy signon request as it was until few weeks ago before the last two updates.
Thank you

1250162,2019-02-14 08:04:44 UTC,2019-02-14T10:25:43Z,Suggestion to reimagine tabs-bookmarks relationship,"<p>Hi there! I always end up having many tabs open in several windows and today I clued into how much time I waste trying to find the right window. I currently have 128 tabs open over 5 windows and every time I shut down and start up Firefox I ""restore previous session"". I started looking today for a way to label my windows so that I can have them as categories like ""Music"", ""School"", ""Health"", ""General Learning"", etc.  I use a Macbook and use the 4 finger swipe down or up all the time and wanted to see my windows labeled to clearly see the types of tabs I have open regardless of what tab was up front. There are a few plug ins that do that but I don't like the permissions that they need like ""Access your data for all websites"". it seemed excessive for just a label.
</p><p>Then I thought. well it's basically a visual bookmark system. but I don't use bookmarks because everything disappears once I put it in bookmarks - it becomes less relevant when it's next to things from 8 years ago. here's what I imagine:
</p><p>Primary idea:
</p><p>- windows and bookmark folders are virtually the same thing, and tabs and bookmarks are virtually the same thing.
</p><p>- I can command-click or option-click on one of the bookmarks in a folder and it opens in a window that is labeled as the bookmark folder name
</p><p>--- I can command-click-drag to open several bookmarks as tabs in a window that is labeled as the bookmark folder name
</p><p>--- new bookmarks I open from that folder open as tabs in the window of the same name if it's already open
</p><p><br>
Secondary thoughts for better flow:
</p><p>- button in top corner of window will open a list of all the tabs open in that window but the list will be wide enough that you can actually read what the tab is instead of just the first 5 letters. 
</p><p>--- this way I can easily reorganize my open tabs.
</p><p>--- below list of open tabs in that window is a list of the other bookmarks in that folder that aren't opened that I can click on to open or drag up into the the ""open"" list and drop it where I want that tab to open up.
</p><p>--- if you want to get real fancy I can drag the tab from the list back up to the top corner and the other open window lists open up so I can move it to a different window - alternatively I can right click on it and select ""move to"" or ""copy to"" and choose a window or bookmark folder.
</p><p>- colouring or aging can show how recently each tab or bookmark was opened - This link shows what I mean <a href=""https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210012/card-aging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210012/card-aging</a>
</p><p>- Turn on an option that when I hover over the title it shows a small render of the site (in bookmark menu or tab list)
</p><p><br>
Troubles to think about:
</p><p>- Discerning between short term bookmarks (stored tabs) and long term bookmarks (regular bookmarks) - perhaps add a ""lock"" to the bookmarks you want to keep.
</p><p>--- some bookmarks i want permanently saved until I delete the bookmark (how it works now)
</p><p>--- some I want to be more transient so that when I close the tab it means I'm done with it (how I treat tabs now)
</p><p>--- when implementing the ""move to"" or ""copy to"" suggestion above, you may want that move or copy to be a permanent or transient bookmark. I suggest keeping the ""bookmark"" word to mean permanent so perhaps a ""bookmark to"" option.
</p><p>--- Perhaps closing a window doesn't remove them from the bookmarks folder, but closing the tabs individually does unless it's ""locked""
</p><p>All of this will help me to keep my tabs to a minimum when I start firefox and when I want to pick up on a different subject I can easily open all of the relevant tabs - most of which aren't ""bookmark"" worthy at this point, they're just there till I deal with them and close them. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. I feel this would dramatically increase my organization and workflow so I'm here to help

The ""default"" size always runs off the edge of the screen, which means they aren't functional as-is (whatever's off the screen obviously can't be read or otherwise interacted with).  It also tends to consistently move windows to the left, so they're stacked right on top of each other (messily) instead of being spaced out.
</p><p>I can and do resize it, but it's a complete pain to do so every single time... especially since I use cascading windows to let me navigate between windows easily, so the oversize and overlap means I can't easily access several windows until I do resize and move each one.  Since my task bar/desktop is unreliable, I can't use the icons or shortcuts pull up windows unless I can actually click on them on the screen - this problem is outside the scope of the question, of course, it just explains why I cannot find a workaround.
</p><p>Since firefox usually restarts when updating or other automated restarts, which triggers the windows to change size on restarting, I tried manually resizing the windows and then manually shutting down and reopening firefox to see if that would ""save"" the new sizes - this was a catastrophic failure, it failed to save or open *any* of my windows, showing no recently closed windows or tabs in history and no previous browsing sessions.  And I do have it set up to open previous windows and sessions, I went through and double checked *every* setting after that.  I did have session sync going, so I could save some of it - but only some, since session sync fails to save the history of any tab (to show previous pages) and I often stack several related pages in one tab to organize.  I have turned to using automated shutdowns (forced shutdowns through the task manager, etc) since I at least won't lose everything that way.
</p><p>I also tried (based on searching for possible solutions) disabling the window resize line in about:config (from here: <a href=""https://codeyarns.com/2011/03/25/firefox-disable-window-resize-or-move/)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codeyarns.com/2011/03/25/firefox-disable-window-resize-or-move/)</a> which did nothing

</p><p>Last time my Firefox updated, something screwed up, as it often does. This time around, it gives this stupidly thick border around the browser, almost appearing like there's a second, slightly larger browser in the background of the first. 
</p><p>Not only is it very unsightly, but it also seems to make it impossible to snap the window into place like I used to do and can still do with any other windowed app. This also makes it impossible to resize the window in general- clicking on the edge of the browser does nothing. I can't resize it at all. This is a huge issue for me.

I set browser.tabs.remote.autostart to false and was able again use browser (and it was working slow because of this option).

</p><p>I then spent 10 mins trying to reset the page to how it was. You end up going through page after stupid page and NONE help. There is a box on one that specifically mentions changing the number of rows etc, but when you click on the link, when the page opens it isn't even mentioned.

All the users have their home dirs on a NAS which are mounted using autofs
All the user are authenticated using ldap
The problem is that when a user opens Firefox for the first time it takes a very long time, it look like Firefox has failed 
to start but after a long wait it starts.  The next time the user start Firefox it opens fine with no delay.
However, If the same user logouts of the computer and then moves to a different computer the same problem occurs. 
As I understand things, Firefox writes a bunch of files to the user's home dir on the first time startup.  Maybe the fact that the home dirs are NFS mounts might explain the delay.
However, when the same user moves to a different computer then there should be no need to write any more config files.
</p><p>What can I do to improve this?

1249986,2019-02-12 20:21:59 UTC,2019-02-13T01:08:46Z,Firefox UI refusing to load components properly.,"<p>Lately Firefox is starting to go nuts on me. This issue started showing up a while ago and only worsened as time went by. By now, Firefox is utterly unusable.
</p><p>Here is the description of the issue: Whenever the browser decides, from that point on loading/refreshing webpages on other tabs will just give me a white, empty page, even if the indicator on the tabs shows that the page has loaded fully. The UI is responsive, except the hamburger menu and any other extension buttons which bring up popup menus; they are all clickable but don't do anything. Sometimes it will freeze my page too (or, more specifically, an image of my page, while the actual page is working on the background, confirmed this on YouTube, by playing a video, and the page froze but I was still hearing sound).
</p><p>At start this would be fixed with a simple restart of the browser, but as the problem showed up more often with the passage of time, this was not a solution. By now, opening FF will just do whatever I previously said IMMEDIATELY, except freezing the open tab.
</p><p>I have tried safe-mode, refreshing, reinstalling, but nothing worked.
</p><p>Nightly (67.0), however, works flawlessly (yeah, I know, that's absurd, but I guess this means the problem is fixable??)
</p><p>Right now I am using epiphany as a fallback.

</p><p>I have reasons for upgrading when and the way I do.  Getting nagware several times a day is ludicrous. Getting it everyday is ludicrous. 
</p><p>The stated reason for removing the ""don't update"" option, which was used by most to remove the nagware, was to 'help' orphans or some such nonsense. If that was real you'd do it once a month maybe to make people aware. That is NOT what you are doing. 
</p><p>Your percentage of the market is deprecating because of nonsense like this. Also breaking all the wonderful extensions we used for years and years.  You seem to have a habit of doing what you want, not what your user base wants. Have any of you ever worked for a commercial product? One that was successful?

</p><p>My color settings in about:config are as follows:
</p><p>1. gfx.color_management.display_profile – When the path to my monitor's color profile is entered, the colors displayed for images in Firefox do not match the colors of the same image on my desktop or in other browsers. (The colors in Firefox Nightly are much more saturated.) Global color-matching is closer when this field is empty.
</p><p>2. gfx.color_management.display_profile – True
</p><p>3. gfx.color_management.mode – 1
</p><p>4. gfx.color_management.rendering_intent – 0
</p><p>5. gfx.color – Boolean
</p><p>Finally, when I try to take a screenshot using Firefox’s native “Take a Screenshot” option via right-click, the colors of the output are completely different from what I see in FireFox AND on my desktop (screenshot colors are much more dull). 
</p><p>Is there a way to manage color settings for Firefox screenshots?
</p><p>—————
</p><p>EDIT: Re: #1 — This setting seems to have no consistent bearing on colors shown in Firefox Nightly. Sometimes when I add the path to my monitor profile and restart FF, the colors displayed in FF are extremely bright/neon for reds, etc. Other times, I input or delete the profile path, restart FF, and the colors stay the same.
</p><p>I've added a screenshot showing a single image in the various circumstances described.
</p><p>—————
</p><p>EDIT 2: In case helpful, I also tested using an add-on to take a screenshot (Nimbus Screen Capture). The colors are also completely incorrect and dull, just the same as using Firefox's native ""Take a Screenshot"" option.
</p><p>I work in design so I occasionally need to be able to take seamless screenshots of an entire webpage, which can only be done with in-browser tools. It's also important for the color output to be correct.

Well for all those people who enjoy a Chrome clone 'bully for you', I hate it, and it can not be solved by normal settings. The fact that the solution lies somewhere in a Chrome coding excercise means that Firefox is now being buit on the Chrome framework, so somewhere in there probably lurks the chrome [read google] 'information dragnet'. That's shut the door as far as I am concerned. I found that Pale Moon still offers 'tabs on bottom'. [so atop the web page] Even Vivaldi, which I am sure is also a chrome clone offers a real Tabs at the bottom, so actually at the bottom of the web page. No after years of use I am kicking Firefox into touch [so expunging]. Now I have to wonder how long it's going to take before I am forced to discard Thunderbird! Oh yes, it says somewhere I should not use the term Firefox is broken... well folks: IT IS

My concern is whenever I updated the browser from the past, It deletes my settings and extensions.
That's whats keeping me from updating it for quite sometime now. So Im simply afraid to do it.
For example. Part of my research entails an extension that downloads and converts from a video site.
After an update this is removed. I have to re-install everytime. I so got tired of this. Its so annoying everytime
it asks for updating, I have to opt out.  Is there some way I can update this without messing up my settings? 
Has Mozilla already worked out a version without messing with my settings?

I have a link to an .m4v video file that I need to download (I don't ever want links directly to m4v, mp4, mov, etc playing in the browser, I need to download these files to my computer).  Whenever I click the link, it automatically opens up a blank page and starts playing the video.  Nothing I do will give me the 'Ask what to do' prompt.  How can I fix this?
Things I've tried:
Changing the default action to 'Mpeg-4 movie' under Options/Applications to 'Always Ask'.  Even if the link is an mp4, it still plays it in the browser.
Manually added an entry for .m4v by editing handlers.json, and setting it to 'Always ask'.  Still plays in the browser.
Set both Mpeg-4 Movie and the manual m4v entry to 'Save File'.  Still plays in the browser.
Tried doing a 'Save As' while it was playing to just save my file, but Firefox then tries to save the file as 'FileName.m4v.mp4' instead of just 'FileName.m4v'.  I'm not sure if it's actually re-wrapping the file into another container, or just arbitrarily adding an extra extension to the filename, but I need it to, by default, save as the file name that is used on the server... (If it's just renaming the file, I can live with this one bug if I can make the rest of the functionality work.)
</p><p>Can anyone offer any tips on this?
Can anyone explain an easier way to manually add an extension into the Application section?
</p><p>Here's a test page:
<a href=""http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody/test.html</a>
Underneath the thumbnail image/embedded video there direct links to an mp4, ogg video and WebM video.
The action I want, when I click on any one of those, is for Firefox to prompt me with a download location to save the file to (the usual 'Always Ask' dialog box).  NOTHING should attempt to play in the web browser itself.
I've been able to do this with every version of Firefox 'pre-Quantum', but I just can't make the latest version do it...
</p><p>(Another work-around that may seem obvious is to right-click the file name and click 'Save Link As'.  While this works on the sample page, it doesn't work on the pages I have to download these videos from...  It's a scripted button that sends back the link to the file when clicked on.)

Upon accepting the update, I once again find myself with ""tabs on top"", an issue I have had to deal with twice before after updating. If it is Mozilla's intention to force people to accept ""tabs on top"" then say so and I'll migrate over to Chrome or the MS thing like so many others have done already. Does nobody read the forums? So my question is, how do I turn off Firefox notifications?

</p><p>I would like to make this suggestion because it would help me sincerely in my everyday work and I think it can be the same for a lot of users.
</p><p>I am a web developer and like many people I use regular SaaS and online applications (looking for a script on Github, check some regex, consult documentations...). In the end the use of these pages is similar to the use of software in its own right.
Daily, I need to return often to pages but they are drowning in the tabs. And it would be useful to be able to find them and access them more easily.
</p><p>The goal of the suggestion is to be able to improve the behavior of Mozilla Firefox tabs by allowing to manage them in an independent window as if it were a third party software. The window could drag and drop into the taskbar, as if it were a different application of Firefox, with as icon, either the icon of the open site or a mix of the icon of the open site and Mozilla Firefox icon to quickly differentiate these Mozilla Firefox windows from other software.
</p><p>This will allow users to open a frequently used work page in a tab, detach it from other tabs, and drag and drop it into the taskbar. As long as the browser is not closed, this page is accessible normally and quickly (in 1 click) from the taskbar. This would provide a more pleasant and fluid UX. Especially as SaaS become more and more numerous and the performance of browsers and scripts allow it.
</p><p>And why not consider being able to attach its windows to the taskbar to allow to re-open these windows easily.
</p><p>Thank you to read me so far and i apologize for the English mistakes.
I would be happy to know your opinion on this proposal

I've already asked the question and gave my email address but now didn't see how to get to the forum.  I started out having a problem hearing sound on facebook and youtube videos.  Checked sound on pc - fine.  Had a pc expert uninstall and reinstall firefox and the sound worked last night.  This morning the sound on those videos is gone so I uninstalled and installed firefox again and now it says that facebook and youtube don't have safe connections!!!!!  I didn't appreciate being offered the reimage app and then finding out it would cost me something after it went through my pc.  I am being as nice as my frustration allows.

Additionally after I try  to open any of the sub-menus  even the main Firefox menu draws only an outline. Firefox behaves like this until program restart. After it's opened once again the main menu is accessible (but not uBlock and VDH menus). The other way is to open a private window and access the main menu there ( but only the main menu as in ""regular"" window).  I tried to uninstall the add-ons and clear all the config files but no luck there. Besides, Firefox menu behaving strangely on its own indicates that it may not be any add-on's fault.

I'm on a Mac.,"<p>Firefox automatically updated on my iMac to v. 65 which moved things around and changed the colors. I just was able through the community forum to get the tabs back below the bookmarks toolbar, where they make more sense. However, the tab colors are now the same as the background for the address bar (I guess it's called that) and the bookmarks toolbar. In the previous version, the tabs were slightly darker so they stood out, and the selected tab was lighter so you could easily see which tab you were on. That's gone too. I've looked at theme add-ons and none of them will work for me. I just want a simple uncluttered browser page with easily visible tabs. The current theme I have is called Soft Aqua by Tracee. The color is fine; just need a way to make the tabs stand out. I've attached a screenshot of the way the browser used to appear and hope that someone can help me approximate the way it was. Thanks.

But unfortunately, it started to start running , but when I checked the properities, the owner was no longer Superanitspyware but a company called <a href=""http://Support.com?"" rel=""nofollow"">Support.com?</a> This was after I had changed the file and folder permissions to allow System access to the software file and folder I had installed SuperantiSpyware to. Now it looks like the Superantispyware software is running (and its Ui Dashboard Console), but when I check with TaskManager and look at it's properities , I see it was sponsored by someone else (I mean the software itself as seen in the properties submenu of Taskmanager for the .exe file - it doesn't mention SuperantiSpware.exe ; the digital signatures page for the software now says <a href=""http://Support.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Support.com</a> instead of the name of SuperantiSpyware company!!).

Is this really the case? My two choices are allow the supremely annoying autorefresh (which I turned off for a reason), or spend the rest of my life clicking the 'Allow' button every time I try and follow a link from Gmail?

</p><p>1.  When using HTTPS, the time in seconds before Firefox stop loading the page, and I then have to press F5 to continue loading the page and the remaining elements, do vary between each test!

</p><p>Here is my problem. Recently (as recent as one year or so), somehow Firefox manages to grab a link with my mouse or Wacom's pen so that when I click somewhere on a website's page, it unwantedly drops the link and load the new page.
</p><p>I really don't know why and how the browser manages to grab a link (maybe somehow it interprets my way of moving the cursor or else). It happens sometimes but not all the time. Then I need to click somewhere within the page to bring the focus to the page (otherwise, I can't navigate in that page using key like page down or up, home or end or scrolling with the page). So when I click within the page I want to navigate, Firefox assumes I want to drop the link that was attached to the cursor on this new tab. It loads the new page forcing me to use back button to go back to the page it was there.
</p><p>The only solution to this dilemma seems being completely disabling link dragging and dropping feature. Is it possible to do so?

This hadn't happened in months, so I hadn't updated Flash Player in a good while.  The first time, I ignored the warning prompt and activated Flash anyway and played the video. This was from <a href=""http://tcm.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tcm.com</a> (Turner Classic Movies). The second time, I decided I'd better update Flash Player, and did so. But now the video wouldn't play at all. There was a locked box icon. I searched on various fixes, looked at a few Mozilla support pages, did a plug-in change starting from the sandwich icon at upper right, same thing. Found another fix idea. Went into the C drive, navigated eventually in Windows to the Macromed and Flash folders, and deleted NPSWF32_9_0_0_169.dll. The red locked box went away. A video played. Next time out, though, back to nothing. In IE, the link will play.

When I click on another window and change focus, it reverts to the light gray that it should be, however going back resumes the problem. Starting in safe mode does not help, and turning off hardware acceleration does not help. I have restarted both the browser and my computer, and the problem resumes. The only thing that seems to change it, is when I change it to certain themes like space, who completely change the color of it. The default, dark, and light themes all are affected by this bright blue tab bar.

In Chrome there are no issues with this, but I don't want to use Chrome, I like Firefox.
I think the issue may be because it is not an alphabetized list, or in any way organized. Is this something you can look fix?

</p><p>Chromium scrolls very smoothly, even with low trackpoint actuation.
</p><p>Firefox, on the other hand, jumps (I am guessing 5 lines or 400 ms, from mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount or general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMaxMS, respectively) when the trackpoint is lightly actuated. It scrolls relatively smoothly with higher actuation.
</p><p>Firefox seems to interpret middle button scrolling as a mousewheel. Hence the jumps. So I can increase general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMaxMS to 1000 ms or a higher value to get the behavior I want (Chrome-like, where it crawls instead of jump). However, unsurprisingly, the page drifts for that amount of time after letting go of the middle button...
</p><p>Autoscrolling works fine. But I would like to hold the middle button while scrolling, for better control.
</p><p>In summary, the trackpoint does not scroll smoothly in Linux; it jumps when lightly actuated, instead of crawling.

(IE removing junk we do not need/want -ie: bookmarks toolbar, etc) and moving elements where they feel most natural and intuitive to us(IE as the above, tabs below address bar)
</p><p>But each major update requires extensive userChrome.CSS modifications to 'fix' (And in some cases, never get back) simple things that we had set the way WE want.
</p><p>We have asked many, many, many times for you to STOP blocking our ability ot make these changes, yet each new major update, as i explained, we have to 'find new tricks' to fix the issue, when these options can simply be part of the customize firefox option(Btw another option that was requested multiple times, with us being utterly ignored)

1249265,2019-02-06 06:31:02 UTC,2019-02-06T08:36:45Z,Firefox updated; Everything is gone.,"<p>Howdy,
</p><p>Normally Firefox is great, but a recent update has removed all my extensions, add-ons, bookmarks, cookies and all passwords. I can recover passwords 'easily' enough, but what bothers me is the missing extensions, as I cannot find any trace of them on the playstore to re-download. I've followed multiple support articles stating that you can do a refresh in settings, which will create a desktop folder called ""Old Firefox Settings"". All this has done, is copy the same settings where everything was removed; the ACTUAL old pre-update settings are nowhere to be found, nor are my extensions.
</p><p>Speaking to friends that use the same extension, and the same browser, this in fact hasn't happened to them. The update went smoothly and they experienced no issues.
</p><p>And no, I didn't mess with any of the settings prior to this, I simply opened my browser this morning to find everything missing.
</p><p>It's difficult to not feel frustrated with things like this, and I'm fighting the urge to just switch to chrome.
Can any of you tech geniuses help me out?
</p><p>Kind regards,

1249259,2019-02-06 05:40:24 UTC,2019-02-07T14:43:24Z,Downloaded files are deleted upon exiting Firefox Quantum,"<p>For several weeks, files downloaded during my browser session were automatically deleted when I exited Firefox.   The problem may have been limited to html pages downloaded using ""Save Page As..."", but could have been regular downloaded files as well, but I didn't notice.
</p><p>I believe that I was running 64.x (sorry I don't remember the dot release number).
</p><p>I think I narrowed it down to the configuration option, ""[ x ] Browsing &amp; Download History"" under Privacy &amp; Security, Settings for Clearing History.    I have always had this box checked, and downloads never disappeared before, just as the option description implies.
</p><p>Then, a Firefox pop-up jumped in my face and told me to upgrade to 65.0, which I did.
</p><p>Now my downloads don't seem to be deleted any more.
</p><p>HOWEVER, I looked at the list of fixes for version 65.0, and saw NO MENTION of this problem, so I am asking you to confirm whether or not this was a known problem that was fixed in version 65.0, or if you think I am experiencing an intermittent problem that may return to haunt me when conditions are right.

Due to another bug in Firefox 65 (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1249037)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1249037)</a>, I need to change cookie permissions. In the preference panel under ""Cookies and Site Data"", the ""Manage Permissions"" button doesn't work, although being not gray. After clicking this button, the expected window is not shown visibly. However invisible window still blocks keyboard and mouse input to the original firefox window. Clicking away from the center of the screen or Esc would disengage and possibly close the invisible window. The consequence is that I can't see or change permissions from this window. I have been having this problem for several firefox updates so it's more like a corrupted file. Despite that, cookie permissions still function properly and can be updated  through the icon on the address bar.
</p><p>Although there are workarounds such as through the icon on the address bar, this is really inconvenient and makes it hardly possible to edit cross site or cross subdomain cookie permissions. How do I figure out what is wrong and correct it please? I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.

</p><p>i'm the person that in love with firefox for very long time but in the past, using firefox was not a good idea because it was slow but thesedays, it is really good even if it still has some problems. but for my country which is turkey, when i install firefox, it comes with yandex and that is really really discousting for me because when i install a program, lets say mp3 cover program, it was coming with yandex toolbar, yandex bla bla yandex maps and it was really disgusting. 
</p><p>and me and most of users in turkey think that yandex is a virus, we all now it is a search engine but it didnt behave like that in the past and i cant say we like it. and firefox comes with it? no, it shouldn't be. i know i can change it but it is not about that. it is about firefox's vision.
</p><p>i dont feel in secure when firefox comes wiht yandex. i dont know the money that comes from yandex is so much important than secure but, i really dont want yandex in my clean, secure and fast firefox.

</p><p>Original attempted reply:
Same situation, but I believe I know what causes the problem (or at least what caused it in my case).  I was trying to remove a URL that kept popping up that was no longer valid (related to Twitch usernames, seeing as users can change their usernames, which also changes their channel profile), rather than deleting the URL from my history, I instead attempted to use the ""Forget About This Site"" option in Firefox on the History listing; this not only caused the URL itself from auto-filling, but the entire domain...  I don't particularly want to have to restore thousands of Bookmarks after uninstalling &amp; reinstalling Firefox, so I'd sooner just post the details here &amp; see if there is a way to reverse the ""Forget About This Site"" function where it's been misused in the past (in the mean time I'm just clicking on the correct links from my history in the drop-down history while typing it, but URL auto-completion for StreamLabs remains broken, those URLs changing along with Twitch usernames, explaining how URLs can be invalidated after a Twitch username change).

</p><p>In order to duplicate this behaviour try the following: Let's say you click on the link 'Here's more about the flower arranging for fire-eaters workshop'.

If you're like me, you click the link fifteen times because, as we all know, clicking manically is bound to make it work. Later I discover I have fifteen instances of 'flowerArrangingForFireEaters.pdf' in my downloads folder. 
</p><p>A related behaviour, depending on how the page script has been written, is that a blank page opens each time you click. Same outcome.
</p><p>So what's the problem? Well, that little arrow up in the toolbar changing from dark-grey to dark-blue is no longer providing useful user feedback. A more evident prompt is needed to tell the user that a file is being downloaded.

For quite a while I was using a custom UserChrome.css that removed minimize\maximize\close buttons from the tab bar.
It looked like this:

/* Firefox userChrome.css */

<ol><li>titlebar-min, #titlebar-max, #titlebar-close
</li></ol>
<p>{ display: none !important; }
</p><p>/* Hide minimize, restore, close in full screen */
</p>
<ol><li>minimize-button, #restore-button, #close-button
</li></ol>
</code><p><code>{ display: none !important; }
</code>
</p><p>But after latest update (to Firefox 65 I believe) the app doesn't recognize the code in UserChrome.css.
</p><p>I understand from Fx 65 change notes there were some changes to how Firefox parses css, isn't it?
</p><p>What should I do to make UserChrome.css work? 
</p><p>I would appreciate any other method of removing minimize\maximize\close buttons from the tab bar if it isn't doable with UserChrome.css now.

I have the latest update on High Sierra 10.13.6 and Firefox 65.0.  United healthcare problem started about 5 months ago when some of the pages would partially load or not load at all.   Clearing cache and cookies, etc. used to solve that problem, but not any more.   Problem still persists. 
Then after another update about a month ago, Yahoo Finance pages showed truncated column shown and inability to scroll to bottom of editing windows to save changes.  That seem to resolve after about 2 week and full screens reappeared.  But the Yahoo Finance problems came back after Firefox most recent update.
Also,  about a month ago my TD Ameritrade website started to load very slowly about the time the Yahaoo problem became worse.   Now, after the latest update, I get the the login page, but after inputting the id and password, website never connects---justs gives me a blank page that never loads.  
In summary, I have 3 important websites that I cannot access or navigate using Firefox, BUT CAN ACCESS AND NAVIGATE USING SAFARI.
I prefer, and been a loyal user/promoter of Mozilla products for decades especially for their versatility, and superior security.  I hope that something can be done, so that these important sites will again fully function using Firefox.

Forced upgrading is completely inappropriate.  I've used browsers since Netscape, all of the Firefox versions, rarely use any other browser.  Never had a problem except with your forced updates.
</p><p>Lucky for me I found the registry fix for admins to disable updates.  Reasonably inconvenient but a hell of a lot better than putting up with forced updates that break the browser.
</p><p>Question:
</p><p>How about bringing back the choice to upgrade.  How about, at least giving two reminders to upgrade and then disabling the messaging.  This messaging is extremely disrespectful - i.e. we are going to keep on annoying you until you upgrade (to a broken system).

When a link is left-clicked, it runs ""checkme.php"" to verify the user and log the request to a database, them reforms the mp3 name to ""name-of-file.mp3"", and opens it. Right-clicking, then ""save link as"" would normally still do the logging, then provide a ""save as"" dialog box with the suggested filename ""name-of-file.mp3"" to allow a copy to be saved locally. PDF files are also handled the same way. Both right- and left-click functions have worked verifiably for years in IE, Edge, Chrome and others, and across all sorts of operating systems, but the ""save link as"" function doesn't work in Firefox Quantum. Early versions of Firefox apparently perform a correct ""save link as"" a given page once, but then fail until the page is refreshed ... it's an annoyance, but it does at least do the job. Left-clicking always works properly. However, the ""save link as"" function in Firefox Quantum won't work at all - the ""save as"" dialog box comes up with ""checkme.php"" as the suggested filename (which is wrong!), but then saves nothing ... in fact, when some dummy text is written into ""checkme.php"", no output is produced - it's as though ""checkme.php"" isn't even being accessed. Any clues? (Sorry - troublehooting info says ""We're sorry, but we can't find what you're looking for."". OS=Windows 7, browser=Firefox Qantum V65.0). Thanks.

Closing tabs never affect memory usage. It seems that Firefox never release memory, only eat more with every next website...

</p><p>The best answer:
""The more memory is used the better because it means you don't have RAM wasted. Firefox uses RAM to make its processes faster since application data is transferred much faster in RAM.""
Firefox developers, do you really think so? That eat all available memory for your ONE application is a good strategy?!

There are tons of error reports on the firefox website pertaining to this.
looks like jscher2000 does not think something is wrong and thinks firefox
is configured incorrectly, but lots of people were complaining about this.
Note:  I noticed that very briefly when firefox loads up, it flashes on the
screen one of those firefox home pages that you get when you first install
or upgrade firefox.  Since this is a recently upgraded fedora from 28 to 29, 
I thought maybe it was getting stuck on that page (sort of like a 
splash screen after the upgrade).
........

on subsequent invocations of firefox.  But it does not.  Also it gives the security error.

But i just wish there was an option to make the scrolling respond like Edge does. For me, possibly because i use the computer all the time, all of the little micro-delay when using the computer and various 3D development apps really hurt and make me feel like i can't spread my wings in a way. Hard to explain, but if this isn't the right place to make a request, can someone please alert me to the appropriate place?

</p><p>So I'm on a certain website that use flash player a lot and I realized that suddenly, there was no history of the chats I had with people. Curious, I decided to clean all that with CCleaner but now, the website is asking me to ""activate local storage"" to be able to access the website and to make sure I'm not in private mode. And nothing is working. Here is what I tried so far : 
</p><p>- Update Flash Player
- Uninstall and install again
- Add a permission in the firefox cookies and data
- Tried to right click &gt; Options (I get only ""Allow"" or ""Refuse"" without anything else. No mention of the capacity I want to give nor anything. Just the two options)
- Tried Right Click &gt; Global options &gt; add manually the website. (But the website instantly disappears once I close firefox, not working and I can't even modify anything if Firefox is opened)
- Going on <a href=""http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/fr/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/fr/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html</a>
(Nothing seems to be saved, as soon as I go onto another tab, it's like the first one got resetted.)
</p><p>So I'm getting a bit desperate. Using chrome work (but I'm using mainly firefox), going into private mode does work too (even though it said to not be in private mode) but regular firefox isn't working at all. And as I said, I can't even choose how much space I want to give. All I can do is ""allow"" or ""refuse"" but click on any does nothing at all. 
</p><p>I hope you'll be able to help me. Thanks.

</p><p>I use Firefox and Adobe Flash to play several internet games.  Today, one of my laptops (W7Home-64 bit) updated to FF 65.0 and then would no longer play games like <a href=""http://Tankionline.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Tankionline.com</a> and other Flash games on <a href=""http://armorgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">armorgames.com</a>.  I tried System Restore, which worked until the next time I closed and reopened the browser which then automatically updated to 65.0.  I played around with it, even copying the Profile directory from another computer, removing/reinstalling both FF and Flash, did not work.  Game works fine with MS Internet Explorer.  Other laptop and desktop also worked fine.  Then, I accidentally closed my browser on my desktop (W7Pro-64)  and then when reopened it also automatically updated to 65.0.  It now exhibits the same problem, Flash games will not work.
</p><p>The flash player is launched by FF, but flash games just hang and will not play.  Flash is version 32.0 r0, the latest available.
</p><p>I have a 2nd Laptop that has not yet updated to 65.0 and I have disabled the auto updater while waiting on seeing if the problem can be resolved.
</p><p>Thank you for any suggestions,
Tony D.

</p><p>I use a zillion of different profiles and for some settings, I have to use a ""mozilla.cfg"" file to not lose my mind (and my disk space, deleting the cache upon closing is mandatory).  I use different profiles at the same time, and because auto-update has ALWAYS messed up the browsing sessions, I MUST set the auto-update to manual. Not disable it, I just want to install the update when I'm ready to close ALL my currently opened profiles/browsing sessions.
</p><p>Now with the new auto-update policy, this gets a mess ...
</p><p>In the preferences GUI, I tried changing the setting ""Automatically update"" to ""Check for updates but let you choose to install them"" and monitored about:config, to no avail. No setting gets changed.
The most recently created profiles do not even have an ""app.update.auto / .enabled"" in about:config.
</p><p>There's the ""DisableAppUpdate"" in the new policy stuff, but that's not what I want (""This policy turns off application updates"").
</p><p>So, how can I set the manual update setting GLOBALLY ?
</p><p>Bonus question: the new policy way, compared to the mozilla.cfg way, seems to remove the possibility to pick between DEFAULTING and FORCING a preference (defaultPref / lockPref). Am I right ? If so, why ?

All the saved URL shortcuts reverted to a blank white icon. There is a process for selecting an individual icon for each separate icon using the Properties dialog. That is not a viable solution.

There should be a default file-association between Firefox and URL shortcuts - whether that be a Firefox icon or a procedure to utilize web-address icons, such as ""Favicons""...

I had Firefox up and working for years, though I had been using it rarely in the past couple of years. Still, I even had it ""divided"" between home and a couple of business versions (however that should be referred to). Then, tiring of Chrome (and hating Safari), I though I'd try Firefox again. When I cranked it up, I got a note that said I should update Firefox. So, like a reasonable user, I hit the go button, as it were. Smart move? My reply to that would involve many phrases and words not to be used in polite company. MY Firefox disappeared. Gone. Everything. Settings, bookmarks, ""users."" It was as if I had never, ever installed Firefox before. Virgin Firefox, one might say. Pure, unsullied, unused. So where the hell is MY Firefox? If I can get it back, I'll be delighted. If it indeed, as seems to be the case from my viewpoint at the moment, it is gone forever, then, well, sadly, I will be an ex-Firefox user forever. I can't see any reason for me to try to rebuild it all. Chrome may be annoying, but it does work and work well.

</p><p>Adding to that predicament, the only browser I think that isn't wrapped up in Google's &amp; MS's web, is hopefully Firefox's browser, but my Yahoo's 'final' email today links apparently to only installing FF's latest browser.  Or might as I suspect, I can use an older version of FF, one that's compatible with Outlook 2007 and one that Yahoo aka 'Google-hoo' will 'leave me/us be'?
</p><p>Ultimately I'm wanting to keep what works (my money too), despite the flaunted less secure-ness of W7 and Outlook 2007, because I believe I'm savvy enough to likely avoid the touted pitfalls by avoiding online banking, not e-mailing company's I've not researched beforehand, maintaining reliable and respected AV, etc., etc.).
</p><p>So I'm hopeful can find a FF version that'll support Outlook 2007's e-mail application and  hopefully (only later use will likely tell) browser which still supports Yahoo mail.  Or am I simply being blocked by the expected deals being made designed to force users into buying into Windows 10?
</p><p>Accordingly I suspect if I go with FF's v65, likely I might any longer be able to use my Outlook 2003's email handler, and only be able to send and receive via or through FF's email application, thus likely not the convenience of being able to use my email storage application (Fogware e-mail backup and relocator) to export each year's sent, rec'd emails.
</p><p>So likely as not, I'll be forced to use other means of saving them as mentioned, possibly via FF's browser.  But heck, I found it nearly impossible just to unhide what the current version f FF's browser is (v65), let alone what 'Google-hoo's up to.
</p><p>Long of the short of it is, might someone in the know be able to tell me anything towards what we're dealing with here and how best to go about assuring I can still get my <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> addressed e-mails if not only through FF's browser, then hopefully also thru Outlook 2007?
</p><p>From what I can find and confirm, might FF's v65 browser actually cross link with my Outlook 2003's handler, or if not then surely with Outlook's 2007's e-mail application by simply acquiring a full version of Office '12'?
