1269825,2019-09-30 21:55:41 UTC,2019-10-07T03:18:20Z,Firefox 69 broke all cookie exceptions,"<p>Goal: BLOCK ALL cookies using the strictest setting, then use the (archaic) exception interface to allow specific cookies to be set so that specific websites function enough to be utilized as intended.
</p><p>Firstly, I am a very experienced Firefox user of many years. I have had my firefox set up as described above since installation, so it's not some operator error problem. 
</p><p>I'm uploading three screenshots that will spell out my problem in black and white.
</p><p>The specific issue --as shown in the images-- is that immediately after installing firefox 69 all my exceptions no longer function at all.
</p><p>As you can see in the image showing site information ""mail.google"" and ""accounts.google"" are being allowed. This is because I used the right-click method on the site to create a cookie exception via site permissions under the ""View Page Info"", so please ignore those two for the purpose of this discussion.
If you'll notice in the same image, ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" shows as Blocked with a tiny X next to it. As shown in the image of the (archaic) Cookie Exceptions Interface, the very same site ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" is clearly set to ""Allow"". If I click the tiny X next to ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" in the Site Information's Cookie section (as shown in Image one) the ""exception"" is removed and it just shows ""Blocked"" as it does in the ""<a href=""http://play.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">play.google.com</a>"" <a href=""http://entry.Re"" rel=""nofollow"">entry.Re</a>-adding the exception to the Exceptions lists restores that tiny X but the cookie remains blocked. I have already covered adding redundancies and variants of each domain such as both HTTP and HTTPS etc. I have noticed, however, that entries like ""<a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>"" which used to cover all possible variations by avoiding the prefix altogether have entirely disappeared. It is my theory that this is part of the problem, but on this I am no expert.
</p><p>In summary, I would like to restore my FF69 to what it was before FF69: with all cookies blocked and a few select cookies allowed through. Drastic actions like refreshing everything to new and that sort of thing I do not believe is the solution. What I am hoping for here is to alert developers so that they can fix it in an upcoming patch.
</p><p>Irrelevant Comments:
I had a terrible time trying to utilize this forum. I try to never make accounts and was forced to do so to post here. Fair enough, but in order to do so I had to use Microsoft Edge (BLECH!) because the site simply would not function on Firefox. This is likely to very strict settings on my end but I must say that many other forums work flawlessly. I find this disappointing.
</p><p><br>
I believe it is time for an entirely new cookie exception interface where entries can be sorted, modified and easily accessed. If you've ever scrolled through 8 zillion exceptions you know what I mean. The Site Preferences interface's cookie &amp; site data entries should be click-able with easy ways to allow or disallow. An advanced mode (with a warning for beginners) allowing more comprehensive exceptions on per cookie basis with features like are available in the browser extension named CookieBro would be absolutely ideal. Firefox seems to be becoming less and less friendly to the advanced user with less and less control over content on a per-site basis. My apologies for including some feedback here, but I can't find anywhere else to send it.
</p><p>Thank you one and all for your time in advance, and any solutions that don't involve catastrophic actions will be greatly appreciated.

I used FF with Tab Mix Plus addon for years, but now WebExtension limited most features. One feature I very liked in Tab Mix Plus was changed tab open and close order. For example:
1. I open google site (on first tab - parent) and mouse click with Ctrl a few links. Several unread tabs open, one by one (e.g. 2 to 5 - childs). 
2. I switch to the third tab. I read content. When I close this tab, Firefox should switch me to first tab again (with google site list in this example) - just to the parent tab again. Instead, without TabMix, Firefox switches to the nearest tab on the right, so I must manually switch to first tab. This is very annoying to me.  
</p><p>In other words - FF upon close one tab, should switch to last visited tab - not nearest tab on the right. 
</p><p>Is there any solution for this?
</p><p>Thanks!

A long term problem with AOL web email is they change ads constantly, almost each time you move your mouse.  When one of these ads got hung and didn't load, they often hung Firefox too.  That seems to have has been fixed, thankfully.  Now when an AOL ad fails to load (probably a hung script) and it effects Firefox, Firefox will pop up a bright yellow banner at the top that reads, ""A web page is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do?,"" offering the option to either ""Stop It"" or ""Wait.""  Stopping it almost always solves the problem.  The problem I want to report is, if you step away for a while and then this happens, and you are not there to click either option, and then your computer goes to sleep (I have a Mac), when you wake it, it seems to have eaten all your RAM.  Everything crawls.  I've had to wait many minutes just to get enough RAM to try to force quit apps, hoping to kill whichever one is causing the problem.  Over time, I've learned when this happens, and my Mac slows to a crawl upon waking it, the source of the problem is almost always Firefox, with a hung up AOL ad.  If I can force quit Firefox, I can (albeit slowly) recover normal function.  My suggestion: put a preference setting for a  timer on these yellow banner ""Stop It"" or ""Wait"" alerts.  If, say, a few minutes go by with no action on the user's part, automatically ""Stop it.""

</p><p>Our users are annoyed as there are now extra steps required to change the File Type box to show all the existing pdf files in the download folder so they can more easily rename the file (they click once on an old file then change the date in the file name).
</p><p>Is there a reason Chrome and Firefox treat these differently?  Does Chrome read the file header so it knows what the file actually is (kind of like Irfanview does with images)?  Can Firefox be made to do the same?
</p><p>thanks

No blue header, no search box, no profile name, no home, no notifications, nothing, a totally blank page. Just <a href=""https://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com</a> in the address bar with the green padlock. If I click on another person’s FB link, I get ""Sorry, something went wrong"" ""we are working on getting this fixed as soon as we can. Go Back or help.”  
Clue #1 The Firefox browser my FB was bookmarked on, started messaging that it was NOT my default browser. (it WAS; before the problem) When I tried to make it my default, Firefox was NOT on the list. Thought I may have a virus. From IE I downloaded and ran Microsoft Safety Scanner - zero infections.
Clue #2 Other browsers (IE, Edge) on this computer, that had my FB bookmarked cannot excess any FB pages.  All other non-Facebook bookmarks work as normal.  One Chrome browser that only had my wife’s FB page bookmarked on it, was not affected (all her bookmarked FB pages are still accessible as before.) I can even see my FB page with it and can message to it. Another home computer (Windows 8.1) has the exact same problem – all browsers with my FB page bookmarked are blocked from getting to any other FB page. The Chrome browser with only my wife’s FB page bookmarked is not affected.  
Clue #3 After two days I uninstalled my Firefox browser and downloaded a new Firefox browser. Firefox wanted me to sign up for an account.  I used the same email address for this new account as I had for my Facebook sign in account. I was unable to create the Firefox account, got ""500 Error Oh dear, something went wrong there. We've been notified and will get working on a fix."" And tried to verify this account via the same email and I got “Verification error (loading Chunk 23 failed)” Later I was able to create the new account and verify it by using an email other than the one for signing into Facebook. (My wife’s FB sign in email account is NOT the same email provider as mine.) 
Clue #4 Found my Facebook page. I searched for it using my name and “Facebook,” it was at: <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/(my"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.facebook.com/(my</a> name)?refid=7.  Bookmarked it on my new Firefox browser. Researching M.Facebook , I get: “<a href=""http://m.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">m.facebook.com</a> is styleless version of the site with limited capabilities. It is intended for those with older phones and less powerful mobile browsers. It allows just viewing your feed and commenting on posts.” It only uses the center part of my computer screen. I didn’t have to sign into it. I can message my wife and she can message back. I can see my friends list and comment on their posts.  See screenshot of m.facebook. Note: a couple hours before this all started, my Firefox browser was hijacked with a message from Microsoft (see screenshot) I assumed it was malware and deleted it the way I normally do. Right clicked on my task bar&gt;task manager&gt;Firefox&gt;end task.  
Sorry this is so long winded. I thought you needed all these clues to help diagnose my problem.

mám problém s načítáním stránky se hrou. Před pár dny mi odpoledne ještě vše fungovalo a večer se stránka načetla nekorektně. Od té doby nemohu používat Firefox, ale ostatní prohlížeče fungují. Na druhém počítači se stejnými Win7/64b mi stejná verze Firefoxu normálně funguje, takže problém musí být v konkrétním prohlížeči.
Stránka se načte v podivném textovém režimu s obrázky. Jsou na ní stejné informace jako mají být, jen jinak umístěné a cca 1/4 roku staré. Po kliknutí na odkaz proběhne jen refresh této stránky, ale nespustí se hra.
V anonymním okně hra funguje jak má.
Vymazal jsem historii, s tím že jsem zatrhnul vše a vybral i čas vše, vymazal jsem cookies a nic nepomohlo.
Přes nápovědu jsem vyzkoušel spustit firefox v nouzovém režimu bez doplňků, ale ani to nefungovalo.
Řešil jsem problém s podporou hry, ale netuší co může být špatně s konrétním prohlížečem.
Přes Nápověda - technické informace jsem se dostal k profilu, ale složka Temporary je prázdná a nenašel jsem kam se ukládají dočasné soubory abych je zkusil smazat ručně.
Ani na stránkách podpory Firefoxu jsem nenašel odpověď.
Můžete mi poradit co ještě vyzkoušet?
Díky Pavel

</p><p>Sin embargo, aunque estamos usando Google Analytics, tenemos desactivadas lo que ellos llaman “funciones publicitarias”, que nos darían acceso a datos demográficos y de intereses (a cambio de permitir el rastreo de usuarios, cosa que nosotros no queremos permitir). Y por eso están desactivadas.
</p><p>Además, como se puede ver en el código fuente de la página citada, usamos Google Analytics con “anonimización de IP”, para proteger más a nuestros usuarios (aunque esto no tenga que ver con el problema objeto de la consulta).
</p><p>Lo curioso es que (aunque en Firefox 69 aparece el aviso del boqueo), realmente Google Analytcis está funcionando para las visitas que recibimos desde usuarios con Firefox 69.
</p><p>Entonces, la pregunta es: ¿por qué aparece ese aviso en la barra del navegador, si realmente no estamos (creo) permitiendo ningún rastreo, y Google Analytics funciona con normalidad? ¿Firefox es capaz de distinguir si una cuenta concreta de Google Analytics está usando rastreadores o no los está usando? Si no es capaz de distinguir, entonces, ¿por qué alarmar a los usuarios mostrando ese mensaje?

The problem was switching another account. The same problem obviously through a computer browser (design mode). I understand that the error is Google, but still I believe that the browser must work even with such errors. I also encountered the problem of translating pages. Let's say from English to Russian. I have a google plugin. I think that it would be better if Mozilla had its own plugin and it was better than Google's. I see the pluses in you and I hope that the performance of your browsers will be better than Google and Apple, but when I see such errors, they unfortunately do not give such advantages. And I believe that it is necessary to work on the design of the browser for a greater desire to use and open it. I will be glad if listen to me. Thank you for your product.

</p><p>I almost gave up using it, but then found the refresh function. The first time I did this, it sped things up nicely and I retained everything. Within a week, Firefox slowed down again.

</p><p>I have seen the solution that things can be copied from this profile folder into the new profile folder. 
</p><p>However, I have to say that from a usability perspective, this is a real fail. To ask users to selectively copy files even once is just a pain in the ass. To expect them to do it once a week (at least) in order to keep Firefox running crisply is ridiculous.
</p><p>I implore the Firefox team to come up with a better solution to help users keep Firefox running smoothly. I know it's complicated and that add ons are the real issue. But there's got to be a way to make this process more user friendly. Even just a notification when the browser senses itself slowing down that points to a well written, step by step troubleshooting guide would be good. 
</p><p>Or perhaps a refresh that disables addons but keeps the rest of the data. That might help people more quickly realize that an addon is causing the slow down (assuming that is the case).
</p><p>I don't know what the best solution, but there has got to be a better way than refreshing, losing all data, and then being expected to selectively copy information into a profile!

(It chooses a consistent one from some older bookmarks I have... let's call it ""random"" as there's nothing special about that older bookmark, but it's mostly consistent (more below on that.).  
</p><p>If I drag from the URL line to the DESKTOP (or from a Bookmarks toolbar folder of links) it will have a different icon. The icon is again generally consistent but again random in that it has no relation to the item being linked.  I can't seem to figure out what condition causes one or the other.  Note that every once in a while it will also give me this alternate icon for a URL dragged to the menu/toolbar. Once it's done that, that will forever be the icon for that link - even if I delete the link and start over. Sometimes it gives me the Firefox default icon (when it should give me a favorite from the site) but that's in a few cases. Once again, I can't seem to figure out what condition causes one or the other (or the other). 
</p><p>If I look at the Library pull down tool/menu of ""Recent Highlights"" it will be correct. However, if I look at the Library -&gt; Bookmarks under Recently Bookmarked it will generally be wrong. Sometimes it will be correct in both but continue to give me the wrong icon (Firefox default) when I drag it from the URL line or Bookmarks menu to the desktop. 
</p><p>If the very FIRST thing I do is to Bookmark this Page upon arriving, it all works normally. But if I drag the URL first before doing that, I get the errant behaviors above.  Some can eventually correct by deleting and using the Bookmark this Page feature but generally they retain some errant behavior.  There is no consistent workaround that works (at all) or consistently. 
</p><p>Note that the correct favorite icon appears in the TAB header, so it's not an issue with fetching the correct icon or there being one supplied by the web developer. 
</p><p>This has been going on for a while... a month or more. It's probably related to an update but I can't tell you which specifically as I usually do them as a matter of course when they come out. I don't know if it was there in 67.* but it's been there in 68 and it's in 69. I've been through many reboots, full shutdowns, even an unrelated hardware swap of the disk drive to a different (but identical) machine, etc. It's not a transitional problem.

I wanted to load Firefox because it reputed to be the least needy with respect to personal information. I don't need to get any emails from <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> and don't intend to send you any. Can I just load the browser without providing an email address (microsoft edge did not require one)? So far the installer seems unhappy if I don't provide the requested email address.

</p><p>We are developing a new website for a client. The client is seeing a strange issue when viewing the site in Firefox, where a thick dashed border appears around an image and column in the footer of the website. It happens when she clicks in the footer somehow. It seems inconsistent, and the client sent us 2 different screenshots where the border line looks different. (Screenshots attached.)
</p><p>We haven't been able to re-create the issue on our end, even after testing on several machines and browsers. The client is using a Windows computer and is running the newest version of Firefox. She only sees the issue when using Firefox (it looks fine for her in Microsoft Edge).

I noticed yesterday that my bookmarks were all jumbled and out of place. My folders were no longer nested but all unorganized. Fortunately, I had a backup, so I restored it, only for it to get jumbled again. So, I signed out of all devices, selecting to delete everything. So, I imported my backup, and everything is fine. I logged back into Firefox on the computer that I imported the backup to, and again, everything was screwed up. 
</p><p>So, signed out again, chose the option to delete everything and restored the backup again. That is where I am right now. I am thinking something is corrupt with my account, but I do not know how to fix it. I was hoping that someone could help me. I have looked through the support documents, but I have yet to find one that helps me. I am running Windows 10 on four computers, Linux Mint on one and three Raspberry Pies with Raspbian. I also have two Android phones. I have had this setup for quite awhile with no problems until now.

Basically what is happening is that whenever I'm using Firefox, it will very frequently stutter/lag. And by ""frequently"" I mean once every 2-4 seconds. This stutter hangs for about another 1-2 seconds before any inputs I attempted will suddenly and quickly catch up.
</p><p>For instance, if I'm typing (like I'm doing with this description) it will regularly hang as I type for about a second or two. I can still type while it is hanging, but nothing will appear on the screen until it finishes its stutter, then it will suddenly just display everything that I typed.  
</p><p><br>
-Important note: When I say ""hangs"" I don't mean in the tradition sense where the browser goes unresponsive. The browser does not freeze. In the case of me typing in a text box, the cursor still blinks as if it is waiting for input. If I'm watching a video, the video will continue to play, etc. What is ""hanging"" is literally my ability to input anything.
</p><p>Another example: Scrolling. I'll attempt to scroll, then it will hang for a moment, then quickly jump to the location it 'should' have scrolled to. 
</p><p>This goes for literally any input. And Like I said before, it seems to be getting worse and worse gradually over time. It started as a negligible little hiccup that happened randomly. Then it got more frequent and more pronounced. Now I can't even type a full word without it lagging out. Just earlier I was watching a youtube video and tried to click my mouse to pause the video... but the video didn't pause for a full 3 seconds until after I clicked my mouse.
</p><p>Things I have done so far:
</p>
<ul><li>I made sure I was using the most recent version of Firefox (69.0)
</li><li>I downloaded chrome to test if that gave me the same issues. It did not. Everything worked super smoothly. 
</li><li>I looked at the resources Firefox was using in task manager and Firefox uses about 530mb of memory, and hovers between 4-11% of CPU usage.
</li><li>I have already attempted a restore for Firefox, which did nothing to fix the issue.
</li><li>I've made sure my graphics drivers where up to date.
</li><li>I've disabled hardware acceleration in the settings.
</li></ul>
<p>I've been using Firefox for over 12 years now and I really don't want to switch browsers... but I don't know what else I can do.

In the past I have usually just ignored this prompt when I didn't want it to do either and usually it has been ok.
</p><p>Every once in a while however, Firefox just decides to create a new saved address without my telling it to and without telling me about it.  Then on some future website when I go to fill out a form, I will suddenly find that I have what look like duplicate choices because Firefox only shows the list for the current field plus a little more data which may or may not show what is different.
</p><p>The most recent instance, Firefox created a duplicate of my name, address, email, phone, etc. The only difference was that the new address included data in the Organization field.  It took me while to notice it because most online forms don't have anywhere for the Organization to go.  I only noticed the extra address when Firefox used it as part of my mailing address when I placed an order online.  Then I had to think to figure out where Firefox had gotten that 'Organization' -- I realized that I had typed that phrase on a website form a few days earlier, but certainly not in any field labeled ""Organization"" and I certainly didn't tell Firefox to save it.
</p><p>I need to use autofill to fill out online forms -- There are several forms that I fill out once a day, but I also use autofill to fill in my name and address on a lot of other online forms where occasionally I need to type in some of the data.  This seems to be when Firefox just decides it ought to keep whatever it saw me type.
</p><p>I like Firefox and have it as my default browser, but I have noticed that Chrome and Opera both do a better job of filling out online forms

Then, instead of actually restarting, I get the dialog forcing me to create a new profile, which it then runs.  Then I have to find the profile list, start a browser with my real profile (which I've carefully saved at this point), and then kill off the instance with the new profile.  I can't figure out how to get out of this cycle.  I've turned off automatic updates, but something  (??) still seems to be updating automatically.  When I check the app contents, I can see that some files/dirs have last-modified times corresponding to the update times on the support page, so something really does seem to be happening.   The contents of updates.xml seem a bit strange to me, BTW, but I don't know how to parse the entries very well - see image below.

So I allowed the connections. In my Firefox browser I checked options - privacy and security- permissions - exceptions and found the same URL as the pop up ""go"" button/message had linked to. I cannot remember the name of this website. I deleted the exception. Then I reopened Firefox browser and I was able to connect to websites.
Has this happened to anyone else ? What caused it and how did  they turn of the rules for Firefox in my firewall ?

</p><p>In Firefox - and only firefox - if I'm composing a new message, pressing enter generates a single line break as I'd like and expect - new paragraphs require two ""enter"" presses.
</p><p>EXCEPT, since 69.0, if I include a bulleted or numbered list in the message, when I end the bullets or numbering, the text below it inserts a forced double space with every ""enter"" press.  That is, single-spacing before the bullet/number list; double-spacing after it.
</p><p>Here is a ""selection source"" of a short message I composed:
</p>
<pre>=======
&lt;div id="":ol"" class=""Am Al editable LW-avf tS-tW tS-tY"" hidefocus=""true"" aria-label=""Message Body"" g_editable=""true"" role=""textbox"" aria-multiline=""true"" style=""direction: ltr; min-height: 376px;"" tabindex=""1"" contenteditable=""true""&gt;
Before the bulleted list line 1&lt;br&gt;
</pre>
<p>Before the bulleted list line 2&lt;br&gt;
</p><p>Before the bulleted list line 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet list line 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet list line 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet list line 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bulleted list line 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bulleted list line 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After the bulleted list line 3
</p><p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=======
</p><p>If you notice, the ""enter"" generated a &lt;br&gt; before the list, then a &lt;p&gt; after it.  Highlighting the lines after the bullets and removing the formatting (the slashed-out T in gmail compose) changes their selection source to:
</p>
<pre>=======
After the bulleted list line 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the bulleted list line 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the bulleted list line 3
=======</pre>
<p>As you see, the &lt;p&gt; is replaced with a &lt;br&gt; and the unwanted blank lines can be edited out.

In fact almost all frames are dropped. I used to have Firefox 62.0.2, and then directly updated to version 68. Currently I run version 69.  Please note that this problem does not occur with Firefox version 62.0.2 (I reinstalled it and checked the same). I noticed this problem only with 68 and later. Also, this problem does not occur in Chrome, or any other browser for that matter. Moreover, this problem is only with 1080p 60 fps, because 720p 60 fps or even 1080p 30 fps work just fine. I have tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned in Mozilla Support articles, including clearing cache, disabling extensions, using safe mode, refreshing Firefox, reinstalling Firefox, using a new profile, and updating Firefox. None of the steps have worked. I ardently request someone from the Mozilla community to help me. This is the first major bug I've faced individually.

OK, I tried to close the page, but everything is dead, as in a fake page. Seen these before long long time ago so in order to close it I brought up Task Manager and closed the process tree.  Reopened the browser and it was instantly there again. Closed the browser with task manage and ran a McAfee virus scan, CCleaner, and CleanMyPC. Tried again, same result. Checked windows update, same result. Everything is up to date. 
</p><p>I then called Verizon to confirm the phone number that it was trying to get me to call and Verizon confirms it belongs to Mozilla Firefox support. That seemed odd to me given the type of screen I'm dealing with is a scam screen that cannot be closed nor left unless you close Firefox with task manager.
</p><pre>Took a chance and called the number, gets an error message instead as in the number is no good. Double checked the number and is the same one that Verizon had just told me goes to Mozilla Firefox support.

1) Any idea what happened?

In the settings for Firefox it says that my browser is being managed by your organization. But it has no mention of any settings being restricted, and when I clicked the notification to check the policy the page was entirely empty. I also checked the Firefox program folder and there wasn't any sign of an Autoconfic file that I could notice. One user mentioned on Reddit that this issue is often caused by antivirus companies forcefully inserting their own SSL certs to intercept your encrypted traffic, he then suggested turning off ""web scanning"" but my antivirus (which I only use Malwarebytes and Windows Defender) already had them disabled. After doing some research on my own I found out that the antivirus Avast used to cause this issue, and I had uninstalled Avast a while back, so I figured that the reason that the policy wasn't there was because Avast was uninstalled, but, I never saw this notification before today. So if anybody can help me pinpoint what this is and how remove it would be much appreciated. But all I really want to know if is this is something that I should be worried about or is it simply a bug. Also one other question is why the top sites and search bar is really close to the address bar after the latest update. Is this just a design change? Or is this something I need to be concerned about? Because I didn't notice this on Firefox on my laptop. Thanks in advance.

Today, I don't get any option and instead it simply prints it just like it looks on the screen. I can right click and select the ""this frame"" option and then manually print each frame, but that defeats the purpose as I have to print dozens or hundreds of frames at once. Anyone know how to fix this so I can print like I used to? I can only assume this happened with the 69.0 update. For now I am having to go back to internet explorer to print all the frames at once.

</p><p>I use tailwind CSS heavily (<a href=""https://tailwindcss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tailwindcss.com/</a>) which relies on adding CSS classes to change appearance. The same applies to bootstrap 4 styles.
</p><p>Chrome devtools autoloads the CSS classes from tailwind, and shows updates to the page as I type. To try this out:
</p><p>1. go to <a href=""https://tailwindcss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tailwindcss.com/</a> in chrome/chromium
2. open devtools (f12)
3. switch to the ""Elements"" tab
4. use the element picker to select the ""Get Started"" button
5. in the right hand panel, select the "".cls"" icon
6. in the box that says ""Add new class"", type ""text-""
7. notice the dropdown and if you change the value (e.g. to text-blue-500) the page updates
</p><p>In firefox devtools with the equivalent "".cls"" feature:
</p>
<ul><li> the classes do not auto-populate
</li><li> changes are not shown until the enter key is pressed.
</li></ul>
<p>For me personally this is the only feature I use chrome for. Firefox completely satisfies me for all other usage.
</p><p>Is this something that can be implemented? I have reasonable software development skills so would be willing to assist with this change.

I know which I created but 1) someone hacked into my email and 2) when I went to log in to of course change passwords, I see this user name I did not create. Something like Gina2659 -- I see it show up but I put in the real name, 
How did this come about? I did not create that. 
How do i get rid of it? 
Is there a way to get firefox to unremember it? I would appreciate un-doing it.
Also, most important, someone of course accessed my email because a folder was created that I DID NOT CREATE and it was a ""send"" folder when I have a sendmail folder. I have no idea for how long, probably not long, but there were emails I sent months ago, MONTHS AGO LIKE MAY that I saw in that folder. I got rid of the folder and of course went through the process of changing passwords to my email, and am going to change this one, too.
</p><p>Another issue: I do NOT EVER want a password for everything. How do I check to be sure this is not the case with the mozilla password I have? When I see the ""you did it! your signed in"" and then get firefox everywhere else"" Does that mean this password is used for other things in firefox? I only want a password for the browser which should also be used to get help, whether they call it firefox or mozilla. I think the one password that opens all is insanity. That is what google does. This is why I don't ever use chrome anymore. 
It is why I make sure to change my gmail password every month.
Why I cringe at even having to have it in my smart phone and why I will never gt another android phone.
I appreciate your help and insight.
(I ASSURE ALL, there is no way I created that folder, and NO WAY anyone else could have because I am utterly careful and NOBODY else can use this notebook unless they hack in.)
I think this happened around the time a week ago I first saw that ""user name"" gina6598 whatever. NOT my creation.
thanks,
Gina

<p>NOTE that I did not open any gedit intentionally during that time window.
So far, I have not closed the unresponsive window, in hope that I would be able to restore those tabs. But I am not sure where to start. The $HOME/.mozilla/firefox director is about 100MB.
</p><p>Could anyone help? I am willing to provide any more information and I am willing to invest my time on this.

It allows a website to instruct the browser to reject any certificate not found in Certificate Transparency, a read-only public log of certificates which can be audited. Because Expect-CT is an HTTP header, it is a trust-on-first-use protocol that relies on long-term caching to ensure security. While Expect-CT does not prevent a compromised Certificate Authority from issuing a fake certificate, it does limit the damage by forcing the addition of the certificate to the log. The domain owner can then report the fake certificate and attempt to get it revoked."" [Protonmail]

The same applies to TB 68, I guess it's the same mechanism behind. I cannot comprehend what the devs thought here and I'm quite furious right now since this breaks up my whole setup. The official support page refers to Firefox Sync in this case, which I'm actually using, but that covers only a small portion of the now missing stuff. I cannot sync the current session, add-on settings, cookies, site preferences (like allowing cookies for certain sites), many settings (default search engine, telemetry etc.) and much more and for Thunderbird it doesn't work at all.
</p><p>I found here - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260190?mobile=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260190?mobile=0</a> - that it's apparently possible to restore the old behaviour by deleting compatibility.ini but I'm not sure if this breaks things in Firefox or Thunderbird, I obviously don't want to lose my bookmarks, open tabs or other stuff. How risky is this and are there alternatives? Many thanks for helping me.

Tengo un problema grave, la fuente de alimentación de mi PC ha explotado de tal manera que ha dejado mi casa sin luz. Aunque volvemos a tener luz, la fuente está quemada. El equipo no arranca, la placa base no recibe corriente y no sé si habrá afectado a la placa base.
Imagino que el disco duro C: no estará afectado, pero si se ha quemado la placa base, está claro que el disco duro C: lo voy a pinchar en otro PC en la tienda de informática donde vaya a reparar el equipo, y allí tendré que sacar los datos de firefox para cargarlos en otro equipo, por ejemplo en mi portátil.
Ahora tengo dos problemas:
1) ¿Cómo recupero las contraseñas guardadas en Firefox y las meto en otro Firefox de otro equipo?
No puedo encender el PC, voy a tener que navegar por el disco duro, así que necesito saber las ubicaciones concretas y qué ficheros exactamente tengo que copiar en un pendrive para ponerlo en otro equipo.
</p><p>2) ¿Cómo recupero los favoritos?
¿Dónde están guardados los favoritos? Recordad que no puedo arrancar el PC y no puedo exportarlos. Tengo que entrar en el disco duro desde otro PC, navegar por dentro e ir a las ubicaciones donde estén guardados los favoritos. Copiarlos, y meterlos en el portátil donde tengo Firefox.
</p><p>La verdad que estoy bastante asustado, os rogaría vuestra ayuda.

So I exported those bookmarks than I successfully imported it into FF 69.0. My question is why did that happen? Do I have to export my bookmarks every time I upgrade?

I started using the separate Profiles feature within my account for Firefox recently and I'd like to keep separate settings/bookmarks/history for work and personal use. I work on both my home and work computers but I also use my home computer for personal usage unrelated to work.
</p><p>CURRENTLY
Firefox Sync appears to sync up my bookmarks and other settings and info between ALL devices AND profiles so no matter what profile/device I'm on, I see work related bookmarks/history and personal bookmarks/history all the time. Firefox Sync doesn't utilize the separation of profiles within an account.
</p><p>DESIRED
Is there a way to sync between devices but only within specific profiles? Like for me, I'd like to be able to have a ""work"" profile with job related bookmarks and ""personal"" profile with social media and youtube bookmarks and have both profiles exist both on my work computer and home computer so I could access either from each device. I'd just want Firefox Sync to synchronize my browsing/bookmarks between devices but not between separate profiles. 
</p><p>Is this possible? I've looked everywhere for settings to be able to control how sync'ing between devices/profiles occur but can not find such functionality. I'm aware you can choose what content to synchronize in sync settings but I'm more interested in sync settings between same profiles on different devices.

These sites are almost all financial and when I logon to them as Firefox asks if I want to save the password/username, and I always choose ""Never"".

</p><p>This worked straightforward as expected for more than a decade.  But since 69.0, sometimes, in some sites (LinkedIn messaging is one example), the line breaks between paragraphs (entered, as would be expected, by pressing the enter key twice) are missing - there's only one line break, not two, after a paragraph.

Over the last few months, this problem has become more and more frequent. When playing an audio file (or video with audio), if Firefox is open, my entire system's sound will start ""stuttering,"" for lack of a better word. It does it so quickly that the audio sounds like a buzz. If I quit Firefox, everything returns to normal. I can even re-launch Firefox and play the same video or audio file, and it will work perfectly for a few hours, then it will happen again, and the only solution I can find is to quit Firefox and relaunch it (which is inconvenient if I happen to be also downloading or uploading at the time). BTW, the video continues to play normally--it's the audio that is screwed up--for any application that uses sound (iTunes, VLC, other browsers, etc).

</p><p>hope you can help me understanding this.
</p><p>Browser version: Firefox 60.9.0ESR, installed plugins: NoScript, Ublock Origin, HTTPS Everywhere
</p><p>I'm using NoScript to block all Javascript by default and sometimes I want to verify that blocking works by looking at the console (F12) output.
</p><p>Normally, when I visit a website and NoScript blocks all Javascript ressources, the console (F12) should show me error messages that scripts failed to load.
</p><p>However, on some sites (e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">stackoverflow.com</a>), when I open the console it is completely empty (no output at all) - although Javascript apparently has been blocked (NoScript tells me that it has blocked all scripts and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">stackoverflow.com</a> displays that ""stackoverflow is best viewed with Javascript enabled"").
</p><p>Interestingly, when I leave the console open and refresh that page, all the expected error messages about failed scripts are suddenly displayed in the console.
</p><p>So my questions are:
1) what could be the reason that the expected error messages are only displayed when I refresh the page?
2) could this mean that at the time the console is empty, some scripts are executed? Although NoScript tells me it has blocked all of them and the main site apparently was loaded without Javascript?
</p><p>Your help would be appreciated. Thanks

This works great with chrome where I can delete predictions and it actually works. I already tried everything for firefox and nothing works:
</p><p>- Changed the URL for my bookmark from jira.nex.lan:8080 to jira.nex.lan. There are no bookmarks with the old url.
</p><p>- Deleted everything from my history matching jira.nex.lan:8080
</p><p>- Deleted places.sqlite in my profile (which seems to have erased my entire history)
</p><p>- Press the down arrow button and select the prediction and press shift-delete or just delete. This doesn't work because it's the first prediction. Even if I arrow down and then back up to it, pressing shift-delete or delete just deletes the text from the address bar. The prediction always comes back next time. I went through the list and made sure to delete anything below the top that contained the url.
</p><p>After following all of these steps, when I type ""jira"" and hit enter, it still always goes to jira.nex.lan:8080. The only thing I can think of is deleting the entire .mozilla folder, which I expect would work, but it would wipe out all of my customization, which is not OK.

I am aware that the Firefox Default theme adjusts to the system theme automatically, but a minor difference between the Light theme and the Default theme (during the day) is that in the Default theme the tabs remain dark, as opposed to white in the Light theme (see uploaded images). I believe this is intended behavior, and somewhat a pet peeve for me, but nevertheless feel like there should be a workaround for this. Essentially, my question is two-fold:
</p><p>1) Is it possible to edit the Default theme's light/day setting so that the tabs appear white as well?
</p><p>2) If not, then I want to use the Light theme during the day and the Dark theme during the night, but want to auto-toggle between the two, similar to the case in the Default theme. Is it possible to configure this in Firefox, or is there a reliable add-on/script that can manage this.

Got a new hard drive in place, reinstalled windows, reinstalled firefox, attempted to sign in to sync, managed to remember my password after a few tries. Got my 2FA confirmation code via email, wrote it in the text field. Boom. Wrong password. Tried again. Same thing. I already have like 11 messages with codes to enter, nothing works, neither "" <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/signin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/signin</a> ""  nor "" <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/settings</a> "".  Firefox insists that my password is wrong. I am very sure it is correct, otherwise i wouldn't get a 2FA code. Prior to all this, my Android got stolen. It was pattern locked, sent the command for full wipe, so the PC was the only remaining device still standing, until it crashed too. Resetting my password is TOTALLY OUT of the question, as i have years worth of data and saved bookmarks and logins. I need urgent help, this is getting critical very very fast. I tried pretty much everything i could think of.

Whenever visiting twitter I get a bar pop up at the top suggesting I install ""Microsoft's Media Feature Pack"" and links me through to this article - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows</a> , I have the pack installed and it's up to date, I've tired via the Add Features system in Windows and via direct download, both to no avail.
</p><p>Twitter will not load or play videos and netflix is the same. On Netflix I'm getting:
</p><p>""Oops, something went wrong... Unexpected Error"" and error code F7355 (see this article which indicates browser trouble <a href=""https://help.netflix.com/en/node/105186)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.netflix.com/en/node/105186)</a>.
</p><p>Here are some other things I've tried, none of which have worked:
</p>
<ul><li> Checking for updates on windows
</li><li> Checking for firefox updates
</li><li> Checking for updates with the DRM addon Widevine
</li><li> Ensuring Widevine is ""Always Active""
</li><li> Starting firefox in ""Safe Mode""
</li><li> Using a private browsing tab
</li></ul>
<p>I am running:
</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Pro N (as said above, I have installed the media pack in several ways)
</li></ul>
<p>OS Build: 18362.295.
</p>
<ul><li> Firefox Developer 70.0b3 64 bit.
</li></ul>
<p>I've also been seeing similar issues on my fiances machine with standard Firefox but her's says that Widevine has crashed on the top bar rather than suggesting we install Window's Media Feature Pack, although the other symptoms are the same. I don't have her machine to hand to grab versions from there but everything is up to date at time of writing and I've tried the same troubleshooting techniques on that machine as well.
</p><p>Really stumped on this one and I'm very reluctant to switch back to Chrome simple to play netflix videos, but likewise it's quite important I can play videos around the web. I'll try anything else to fix it at this point, all suggestions welcome!

Under Options/Security, I do not have the 'Block dangerous and deceptive content' box checked, but Firefox still will not allow me to ""Ignore the risk"" and proceed.  Instead it insists that I register the site as not risky after all, which I can't do because it IS risky... I just want to go there anyway and mess with them.  Thus I'm relegated to using an inferior MS product for this activity.  How do I temporarily circumvent this 'nanny state' protection?

He intentado varios pasos pero sigue igual.
1 – Inicié en modo seguro, por si el causante fuera un addon.
2 – Reinicié Windows (Firefox nunca me ha pedido reiniciar, pero por si acaso)
3 – Restablecí Firefox.
4 – Desinstalé Firefox con Revo Uninstaller, luego limpié con Ccleaner y busqué manualmente cualquier resto que quedase.
5 – Eso fue ayer, hoy he realizado una instalación totalmente limpia y me encuentro con el mismo problema; sin absolutamente nada, ni marcadores, ni configuración personalizada, ni addons, vamos tal como se instala y nada más. He probado a guardar varios marcadores, he situado el icono …….y nada de nada, deja meterlo pero no se despliega. En la barra de menús sí lo hace pero me resulta mucho más cómodo el icono.

I use PrintFriendly Version 2.10, which is the only available version for Windows.
This has suddenly started to cause text which, in the original, is an indented quote and/or in Italic font, to appear in very large font size, meaning the text uses much more space (and thus paper) than it should.
If I use PrintFriendly on Google Chrome this does not happen.
I want to continue using Firefox, but may have to switch to Chrome.

Based on upgrade-jasonlz4, it was installed 2019 0529. A screen displayed some information that I did not save and cannot find again. It indicated that my previous profile information was inaccessible but not gone, it could be used by running a older version of FF  and that now the profile info was stored on some Mozilla server and that I needed to create a account. This has been very disruptive. The only account I created was to be able to write this and the new FF seems to have created it’s profile in Firefox\Profiles. I have looked at the release notes for versions 66.0 thru 68.0.2 and don’t see anything about a new profile format or compatibility issues. I have Windows Explorer equivalent access to my restore points and see firefox.exe dated 6/10/2019 which differs from the upgrade file date but I could restore the system to that point.
</p><p>So is it true that there is a profile compatibility issue and I need to use the old firefox to use the old profile? If so, why is it not mentioned in the release notes and if not why did the new FF create a new profile?

I realized I could do this on my desktop as well. Anyways my phone froze while I had Firefox open, and I realized my tabs on there were all missing... I decided not to panic yet because I could still get to them on my desktop.
Turns out when I open the ""synced tabs"" pane on my desktop which is logged into the same firefox account.. none of the 100+ tabs are there anymore either.
How do I actually contact someone that can revert my sync status or whatever to a previous state so I can get my tabs and stuff back that I had open?
Firefox crashing on my phone SHOULD NOT EVER somehow close all of those tabs on BOTH the phone and the computer.
I guess the crash of firefox somehow wiped them out, and then my desktop synced with that account, realized those tabs were ""closed"" and cleared the list there as well.

I create a ublock ""global-filter"" of the domain <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, that blocks loading of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> at <a href=""http://123newss.com"" rel=""nofollow"">123newss.com</a> and everywhere else.
For some reason i'm a frequent user of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, and whenever i try to visit <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> i have to 
temporary unblock the blocking of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>. This creates a lot of friction since i'm a frequent user of this url.
If i create a ublock/whitelist of domain <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> then ublock allows every tracker to load at <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, eg. <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> visit triggers loading of <a href=""http://21trackers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">21trackers.com</a>.
</p><p>The idea is - Block tracking urls globally, but allow auto whitelisting of urls when visited directly.
Analogy: prevent embedded yt videos from loading in arbitrary website, but allow when you have visited  <a href=""http://125yt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">125yt.com</a>, without also allowing every other <a href=""http://21trackers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">21trackers.com</a> domains at <a href=""http://125yt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">125yt.com</a> from loading.
Sounds like containerization or ""cross-site"" url loading block.
Is it possible or am i missing something?

1267814,2019-09-01 07:33:15 UTC,2019-09-01T10:10:31Z,Black screen PC crash on clicking any Firefox link. Requires PC reboot. Windows 7,"<p>Following some harm done to my desktop system in a household short-circuit, which also included the ""loss"" of my second monitor, any attempt to access Firefox results in a totally black screen (not even a cursor). This requires me to reboot the PC. There are no Crash Reports in the Firefox folder.
Thunderbird &amp; Google Chrome seem unaffected.
Incidentally I was wearing surge protection :-) seems it's no good in such circumstances.
Mozilla's ""educated guesses"" relate to the laptop I'm using for this enquiry, not the desktop.
What's up please?

an old post describes my issue and steps i have taken exactly
Now it is not even creating crash reports after it crashes. What the heck is going on? It all started with the last update! I also already turned off hardware acceleration and the multiprocess function, but every time a tab is open, it crashes, restarts, then does not even provide a crash report that is submitted or unsubmitted. It's just like it never happened! Please help! I'm using Chrome for the time being because the crashing was unbearable. I've also refreshed, reinstalled, and disabled addons. It's still doing it! PLEASE HELP!
