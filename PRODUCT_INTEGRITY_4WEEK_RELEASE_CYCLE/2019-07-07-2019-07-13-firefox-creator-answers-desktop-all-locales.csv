I often add a row of pages to a single bookmarks folder, but rather than selecting the tabs and adding all of them at once by dragging and dropping as Firefox allows, I prefer to check them on by one: add one, close it, take a look at the one that follows, either close it right away or add it, and so on. In Chrome it's done with a couple of shortcuts in quick succession, in Firefox its much clunkier because one needs to set the directory every time.
</p><p>Then a really annoying and sort of antiquated-feeling characteristic of Firefox's star icon menu and bookmarks sidebar is that type-ahead motion in it (when I type the first letters of the name I want to move to) breaks on spaces. This kind of motion is the only one that is practical once one has a few hundred directories, but if I have a list of directories like ... ""The Rolling Stones"", ""The Who""... I can only match up to ""The"" then I'm on my own.
</p><p>These flaws slow down the menial job of adding bookmarks a lot. Other things that could bring an improvement in my opinion would be an ""Open in folder"" context menu item for bookmarks search results, and the possibility to restrict searches to defined folders. I think what I've described should be done natively and not by extensions.
</p><p>Keep up the good work and thanks for what you do.
</p><p>Andrea

</p><p>I was watching some videos on youtube when the sound and picture started to stutter. It's like speed was constantly changing from x1 to x0.05 and back again. (It's not speed related) I closed firefox, then instantly got new update and the issue was not solved. It happens on every video but at random time. (The problem might occur at the start or in the middle of the video). 
What I did so far:
</p><p>1. Updated my Nvidia Driver: did not helped
</p><p>2. Checked the video in other browsers: It worked just fine.
</p><p>3. Changed my Headsets from wireless BT to standard headphones: It did not helped.
</p><p>4. Looked for similar issues on forums, but provided solutions did nothing.
</p><p>5. Opened OBS to record the footage. Then it got interesting. It solved the problem. Opened OBS has fixed that issue.

This used to allow me to run multiple Firefox windows with different profiles using bash scripts that were all symlinks to the same file. Today I find that if I want to use multiple profiles simultaneously, I have to
1. Use about:profiles to get the profile manager
2. Find the profile I need
3. Click a button to start a new window with the profile I need.
Compared to running a bash script, this takes a lot more time. I don't see a good reason for trading the command line option for this new system.

</p><p>I'm pretty good with computers but haven't delved into the nuances of userChrome.css, and I *think* that's where my solution lies.
</p><p>Background: due to something I can't nail down in my security settings, the Instapaper plugin isn't able to function as intended, but I discovered that I was able to get the Javascript bookmarklet to behave. Good deal--one less plugin to drain my system. HOWEVER, I'm one of those nerds who keeps oft-used links in the toolbar with the text removed. That means this link has the generic globe for an icon--and I really want the Instapaper I as a visual cue.
</p><p>I've been digging around online trying to find the solution, but while I've gotten as far as determining that I need to tell FF what icon to use in a userChrome.css file--none of the info I'm finding quite matches up with the variables I have to provide. I don't understand how to specify the bookmarklet without using the name field (as it's blank). When I try using the full Javascript string bad things happen, and I'm not sure how to explain wildcards within the context so I could just use ""<a href=""http://instapaper.com"" rel=""nofollow"">instapaper.com</a>"" or something.
</p><p>I am so frustrated by this seemingly easy task! Plus, I'm used to being able to do some searching and sort things out. Not this time... brain hurts! Can someone please show me what the code snippet to accomplish this looks like? 
</p><p>I don't care if the ICO is remote or sits in the chrome folder locally.

I switch back to Tab 1, the text box has lost focus. I type characters and they go into space. I have to click on the box before entering text.

Its not possible to open any website. Its not possible to open a new tab (Have tried refresh,uninstall,etc). Upon investigating I found that we have a policy in Symantec Endpoint Protection that disables all exe downloads from all browsers. If I turn that policy off, Firefox works fine. But we can't do that for security reasons. So my question is what has changed in v68 (v67 works fine) that is trying to download an exe under the hood? We have no plugins, extensions, themes, addons installed whatsoever.

</p><p>would crash report info help?  
there were many unubmitteds--submitted them all except for the two would not submit--say ""failed"" and reloading page gives same result. 
scanning through them randomly, most say EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, but i also saw EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW,  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ and EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION.
could be more, but i don't have the time to look through all 53 submitted reports from 4 june until now--before that, there were only 11 between 28 may this year and 7 december of 2017.
</p><p>thanks for any info/advice!

I have problem with Firefox when web application goes on https and there is ajax request to http. Firefox say: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost/... (Reason: CORS request did not succed). Problem is firefox doesn't send OPTION request to web api. So server part is not in game. When I change address to web api to https, firefox sends OPTION request. 
IE, Edge, Chrome, Opera works fine. Problem is firefox only. Why? How can I change settings to send ajax request to http when web application is on https? I cannot change web api to https! 
I try send request through XMLHttpRequest in javascript. I tried to set up security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false but nothing change. I tried to add &lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""upgrade-insecure-requests"" /&gt; tag into page but nothing change. 
When I downgrade application to http it works fine. So I think there should not be problem on server side. There are following headers on server side:
""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""*""
""Access-Control-Allow-Methods"", ""POST, OPTIONS, GET""
""Access-Control-Allow-Headers"", ""Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, x-requested-with""
</p><p><br>
There is function which is in web application:
function SendData(url, data, handler) {
</p><pre>       var invocation = new XMLHttpRequest();
       invocation.open(""POST"", url, true);
       invocation.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json;charset=UTF-8"");
       invocation.onreadystatechange = function () {
           if (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200)
               handler(invocation.responseText, this.status);
       }
       invocation.send(data);
   }
</pre>

Tried Refreshing Firefox, disabling all Plugins, disabling hardware acceleration; I have no Themes or Extensions; new Profile - none make any difference.
When the map starts to load, it gets to the point where text (i.e. place names) are rendered but the text is garbled and then the monitor goes to sleep.
Any ideas anything else I can try? Can I somehow debug the rendering of the map?
Or am I resigned to always using Firefox in Safe Mode - does this matter anyway?

</p><p>And now like always after update I need to spend hours trying to fix some issues :( This time this is the user interface. 
Since I live in Estonia, after update mozilla decided to change user interface language to estonian ( I want English user interface). 
</p><p>I changed language everywhere I could, googled it, and still part of mozilla is in estonian ( check screenshots).
</p><p>I found similar topic on support channel, and reinstalled NEW firefox client in ENGLISH, but still somehow part of menu is in Estonian. 
</p><p>God, I am so sorry for this crying, but I am really so depressed. Such a waste of time over so simple issue, however none of the changing setting rly help.

</p><p>I do not want my ""AUTOFILL"" being used, yet FIREFOX BUILT IN TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ON!
</p><p>I also use CC Cleaner and it exposed a MAJOR SECRET BUG IN FIREFOX and you can NOT TURN OFF AUTOFILL!
</p><p>The ""Fake"" autofill is reset to always be ON, and if you try to actually Block it, your FF will reboot back to AUTOFILL ON!
</p><p>You can got to Security and  select ""Autofill"" to be off, but its a FACT, IT STAYS ON!  A 2nd security program states the BROWSER PLUG IN is not Off but On!  When I manually turn it off with a 2nd program, it automatically closes FF and reboots back on with AUTOFILL ON!?
</p><p>So Once I turn on FireFox and my autofill in security says OFF, it actually stays on.  Looking at programs browser plugin in CCleaner, it reverts and says FF Autofill is ON!  When you try to clear it and change it to OFF, you FIREFOX Automatically CLOSES!  Then when you restart FF and look again, CCLeaner says its ON.
</p><p>I was wondering why I'd get the same stuff on pages, and I set my Security Autofill OFF.  So you ""assume"" its off, but if you look close, you'll see stuff you typed yesterday, is still valid.  Yet I reset all cookies and run CCLeaner and several other security programs.
</p><p>So why can't you actually TURN OFF FF ""AUTOFILL""?  Their is a SECRET that forces FF to keep autofill ON, even when you select it to be OFF!   
</p><p>Does anyone else find this scam on, where your computer catches FF Autofill being on, when you select it to be off?
</p><p>So all your typing in FF, you may select Autofill ""Off"", but your computer actually reads that Autofill IN FF as still being ""ON"".
</p><p>So is FF only ""Pretending"" to its users to think your ""autofill"" data is OFF, but ITS ACTUALLY BEING SENT?  If not, why is other security programs picking up on the Autofill typing being sent as ""ON"", inside the actual FF program?   Why would a computer security program reading FF, read the blocked autofill data as being ON, while your FF security controls say its OFF inside the FF Browser?  
</p><p>This opens up your computer to having all your typed data secretly stolen, and if you use your CC or bank info or passwords, they are really be SENT!  What a FF scam....  So was this purposely made or what?
</p><p>I never remember having any ""Autofill"" Plugin, until the last few months.  So is this a new addon, that they use to backdoor into FF and steal all your personal data?

I have been using Firefox on my MacBook since 2012, and been syncing to my Android phones since 2015-ish (a Huawei, then Samsung, then another Samsung, replacing them as they broke). I never had any problems. I can't remember if I was able to access already synced bookmarks from broken phones, but since I move my mobile bookmarks into desktop bookmark folders pretty often, I was never bothered enough to check. Last October, my MacBook's logic board broke. Not long after, my phone broke. I got a secondhand iPhone, and signed into sync, but nothing synced up. I assume because my devices are already dead and no longer syncing? Is there anyway for me to access my laptop bookmarks? I still have the hard drive from the MacBook.
</p><p>I finally have access to a computer again, this time a Windows desktop, and logged in to my Firefox sync to see if I could find any of my disappeared bookmarks. Nope, but something weird happened. I have about 200 bookmarks on my iPhone, and the first 139 migrated to the desktop. They show up under the 'Mobile Bookmarks' folder on the desktop, but I can no longer see them on my iPhone. The most recent 20 or so bookmarks are still available on my iPhone, but don't appear on the desktop. What just happened?

Now there is only about:config key that helps to disable it so we definitely need some tick in settings to completely turn this recommendations off.

I've recently been experiencing an issue with Ghostery for Firefox version 8.3.4 on Firefox 67.0.4 (and recent versions) on Windows 10. When visiting Twitter or clicking links that lead to pages on Twitter's domain, I am often faced with the ""log in"" page - even though I am already logged in. By bypassing the cache (ctrl+shift+r) I am able to continue to Twitter as normal. Despite Twitter being categorized as a ""trusted"" site in Ghostery, the issue persists. Completely pausing Ghostery also does not resolve the issue. However, when I disable Ghostery, the issue does not occur and I am not forced to bypass the cache when using Twitter. This issue occurs on my laptop PC as well as my desktop (also running Windows 10 and the latest versions of Firefox and Ghostery); both run the same synced Firefox account. This has only recently begun to happen and I am unable to replicate the behavior on any other websites. It seems that Ghostery is the culprit, but it is unclear to me what is causing this odd behavior.

</p><p>My goal during an update is to be able to continue using the release that is to be replaced until I am satisfied that the new release with its new profile includes as many of the preferences, add-ons, passwords, and other settings that can be carried forward from the previous one as possible (e.g., all that do not cause major conflicts or other serious problems not easily resolved).
</p><p>The majority of the add-ons I use are related to maintaining the privacy, anonymity, security, and integrity of the browser as well as the data which it handles or manages.  Quite a few are redundant so I usually have several installed but disabled at any given time.
</p><p>From my perspective It makes little sense to enable Firefox to send anything to Mozilla (e.g., allow Firefox to phone home) before I am reasonably sure the new installation of Firefox is running well, with the same or a similar set of security and privacy add-ons in place, especially when I was not made very aware that enabling this would make restoring the add-ons I cherish easier in some way.
</p><p>Storage is dirt cheap these days.  Even on this laptop, I can add another 2TB of fast SSD storage via an external port, then move at least a 1TB of stuff off the 1TB internal SSDs -- in other words, I like the idea of having the option of making a complete backup of the entire existing Firefox  Beta release I have been using with all of its pointers to my data on this system, other systems, in the cloud, etc.  before letting the installer create the new installation for the upgraded Beta Release.
</p><p>I gather a system reboot (or at least a browser restart would be in order at this point.  After that, it would be wonderful if I was presented the option of migrating all of my old preferences, other settings, and passwords to new profile of the new installation.  I doubt many of the add-ons I use are so obscure that they would not get tested by at least a few people doing QA for the upgrade so if any might pose problems, I could be told they could not be migrated with the rest that can be carried forward in a routine manner.  (Specific instructions as to how to handle the exceptions would be nice.  Some hints about why the particular add-on does not play well with the upgrade would give users a place to start investigating.)
</p><p>What bugs me the most is that I am dead in the water until the add-ons that I use to block a shit-ton of tracking, fingerprinting, and other kinds of cookies, as well as those used by outright malware disservices found on some sites are in place to make the Web a much safer place for me and the things I use it for.
</p><p>I completely understand why the upgrades to the first releases of Firefox Quantum required most users to re-install most addons and set most of their preferences, but after a major release upgrade or three to Quantum, things should be back to a lot more automated routine that preserves the functionality the user had in the previous release as much as is realistically feasible when the new release is installed in its own separate place with its own profiles, thus giving the user the fall back option of continuing to use the old release until the new one is tweaked enough to be workable for the user.
</p><p>Remember: if you do not want to shed users because they get tired of having to restore things from scratch and perhaps losing a lot of important data or functionality along the way, you have to give them as clear and reliable means as possible of getting from where they where (presumably) somewhat satisfied with the old release to as good or better level of satisfaction with the new release, without making them jump through a lot of difficult hoops or perform what seem to be several arcane rituals.
</p><p>In short, the default process should be to carry forward as many add-ons and user preferences as possible during an upgrade (given the user the option to start from scratch if he likes clean installs or happens to be enough of a masochistic geek to want to go through setting up two dozen add-ons and many specific settings).  On occasion, I will put of with the painful process of cleaning the junk out of an old browser or system configuration, but usually I try to do that as part of routine housekeeping and like it when what should be a simple system or browser upgrade does not end up seeming like going through a full tax audit.

TMG

Read and done the turn on acceleration.Still crashes,"<p>I am not listeing to music videos or waching films, have no more than 4 tabs open. Got 433 gig of free RAM. I am not chatting online etc. I have done the 'turn on acceleration' and done the Content process which is set to 8 as default. Firefox is up tp date, refreshed several times. I am on the net less than 1 hour and it happens.  I am not running anything other than Microsoft Word. The performance tab says memory is 2.7gig. I am really not sure why it keeps telling me I am low on memory when I am not. Any help to stop this happening would be appreciated.

This is despite the fact that we only have one version of Firefox installed and some computers have the -release profile whereas others don't for some reason.
</p><p>I am aware that a number of people have reported this. However, it's not clear if this is a bug where there is only one version of Firefox installed or intended result.
</p><p>My main question is going forward will Firefox be using the -release format or the .default profile?
In other words, was there a bug in a Firefox version causing it to create a -release profile even if there if there was only one Firefox version installed or is it just a case of some computers have not phased in the new profile name yet. This would explain the inconsistencies between computers.
</p><p>The reason that this is a problem is because I use a script to install ublock origin and also to copy a user.js preferences file to configure Firefox. I am now having to copy to both -release and .default profiles on every computer and I have designed the script to install ublock to a -release profile.
</p><p>I would prefer to have one profile moving forward, but need to know whether this will be .default-release or simply .default.  Thank you

Linux running FF, V56, on a hard disk, Linux running FF, V67.0.4, on an SSD and Win10 running FF, V67.0.4, on an SSD. The reason for three is that I'm transferring the Linux on hard disk to Linux on SSD. Going forward it will just be the two SSD installs.
</p><p>There is a single profile that resides on the Win10 SSD that the Linux installs can see, via mounting the Win10 partition. Up until recently, V56 of Firefox was working fine, except for the usual bugbears of huge memory usage etc. Now with some free time, I've decided to finish off the hard disk -&gt; SSD transition. I now have a problem with PW's being ""lost"". Bear in mind all three installs are seeing the same ONE profile.
</p><p>Linux - V57 can read/display the passwords correctly and log me into sites.
Win10 - V64 can read/display the passwords correctly and log me into sites.
Linux - V64 CAN NOT display the passwords hence can't log me into sites.
</p><p>Everything else comes across fine. All of my bookmarks are there, under all three boots. The same cookies are there under all three boots. Just the Linux V64 can't seem to find the passwords. There is one file that has the appendage ""corrupt"" and that is ""content-prefs.sqlite.corrupt"". I have cleared the cache multiple times.
</p><pre>   Any thoughts on what is wrong?

</p><p>It's like trying to build a house without plans - ""here's a hammer, here's the wood, off you go"" then googling for a solution for the walls falling down - you just cannot do it without understanding what it does, how it works and how to set it up.
</p><p>Surely the good developers of this facility have written down how it works and how it is supposed to be set up - eg
- what is retained on FF servers, 
- how can parts (eg passwords) be removed from FF servers, or from one of the devices?
- what is overwritten in the synced profiles
- what happens to conflicting settings
- what determines which setting will prevail in the case of a conflict
- how to remove unwanted tabs/settings which have been synced
- what determines which bookmarks/passwords/tabs/addons end up where?
- what determines which addon settings prevail if there is a conflict?
- are addons settings even synced?
- does it change tabs order?  If so, what determines the order?
-Does it ADD tabs to both devices, does it REMOVE tabs?
- does it retain containers?
- how do you update a sync and ensure up to date data is transferred?
- on a device, eg iphone, what is the procedure to switch between different synced profiles without getting them mooshed up together?
- etc etc.
</p><p>Can someone please put a link to those instructions and specs here? With a link in it for users to ask questions which will be answered in the same page by the designers, so we don't have to trawl (often without success) through pages of guesswork and unworkable workarounds?
