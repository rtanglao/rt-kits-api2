mám problém s načítáním stránky se hrou. Před pár dny mi odpoledne ještě vše fungovalo a večer se stránka načetla nekorektně. Od té doby nemohu používat Firefox, ale ostatní prohlížeče fungují. Na druhém počítači se stejnými Win7/64b mi stejná verze Firefoxu normálně funguje, takže problém musí být v konkrétním prohlížeči.
Stránka se načte v podivném textovém režimu s obrázky. Jsou na ní stejné informace jako mají být, jen jinak umístěné a cca 1/4 roku staré. Po kliknutí na odkaz proběhne jen refresh této stránky, ale nespustí se hra.
V anonymním okně hra funguje jak má.
Vymazal jsem historii, s tím že jsem zatrhnul vše a vybral i čas vše, vymazal jsem cookies a nic nepomohlo.
Přes nápovědu jsem vyzkoušel spustit firefox v nouzovém režimu bez doplňků, ale ani to nefungovalo.
Řešil jsem problém s podporou hry, ale netuší co může být špatně s konrétním prohlížečem.
Přes Nápověda - technické informace jsem se dostal k profilu, ale složka Temporary je prázdná a nenašel jsem kam se ukládají dočasné soubory abych je zkusil smazat ručně.
Ani na stránkách podpory Firefoxu jsem nenašel odpověď.
Můžete mi poradit co ještě vyzkoušet?
Díky Pavel

EXCEPT that all of my 50 or so open tabs from that machine are no longer available. From the Synced Tabs list on my laptop, I can see an entry for the newly restored desktop system, but the tab list for that device is empty. In the Devices &amp; Apps list on my Firefox Account page, I can see entries for all of my devices include TWO entries for the desktop system, the newly restored system as well as the old pre-crash system.

The problem was switching another account. The same problem obviously through a computer browser (design mode). I understand that the error is Google, but still I believe that the browser must work even with such errors. I also encountered the problem of translating pages. Let's say from English to Russian. I have a google plugin. I think that it would be better if Mozilla had its own plugin and it was better than Google's. I see the pluses in you and I hope that the performance of your browsers will be better than Google and Apple, but when I see such errors, they unfortunately do not give such advantages. And I believe that it is necessary to work on the design of the browser for a greater desire to use and open it. I will be glad if listen to me. Thank you for your product.

Where this generally solved any webpage data related issues, for now the toggle on the webpage (switch lamp/scene on or off) no longer works. Switching off, next try the status is still trying to switch off. (A manual refresh will show the status is already off).

There is no such tab in the 3-bar menu (attached) that I can see, and neither is there anything that says Options in the Preferences page that I have been able to find. (also attached).
I kind of need to go to Options to make a change to my browser settings, and cannot do so, because there is no Options available to click on.....
Can anyone explain this to me, or direct me to the proper pathway??
Oh yes, and Thanks in advance!!
