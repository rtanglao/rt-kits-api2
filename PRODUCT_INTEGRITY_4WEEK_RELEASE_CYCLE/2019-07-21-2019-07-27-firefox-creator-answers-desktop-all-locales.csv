</p><p>(Firefox 60.8.0esr, up-to-date Debian testing Linux):
</p><p>I again and again get the following message in a pop-up window (not in the browser, not as a hint on top of the page, but as window):
</p><p>Warning: Unresponsive add-on script
A script from the extension ""...."" is running on this page, and making Firefox unresponsive.
It may be busy, or it may have stopped responding permanently. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if it will complete.
Script: moz-extension://...
[ ] Prevent the extension script from running on this page until it next reloads
[Stop script] [Continue]
</p><p>This happens with different scripts, on different webpages.
</p><p>And while displaying this window, Firefox actually stops loading and processing anything until I click ""Continue"", ""Stop script"" or the close-button of the window.
Firefox does not try to continue to work in the background or so. No, it actually causes the real unresponsiveness. Only if I click the message window away, it continues. And it never did not continue yet then.
</p><p>I know that I have a rather slow computer, but I do not want Firefox to annoyingly remind me of that. Browsing would be fine for me without this message. 
</p><p>I of course searched about:config, and also this forum, but did not figure out how to disable this annoyance for example by increasing a timeout or changing some other value...
I tried altering many preferences like dom.max_script_run_time , dom.max_ext_content_script_run_time or dom.max_chrome_script_run_time , but that did not resolve it.
Googling for ""Unresponsive add-on script"" I only found others having this problem (without working solutions) and references to the sourcecode.
I will not disable the add-ons. I do not need a fix for an allegedly unresponsive add-on script, because everything in this regard works just fine; i just need an option like: ""Always continue, and never ever dare to ask me anything like that again"".
</p><p>So, how can one disable this message permanently?
</p><p>Thanks in advance!

It would be great for people who are dyslexic to have open sourced dyslexic friendly fonts as options for the Reader Mode fonts.
</p><p>The reason being: Reader Mode could be used to enhance the web experience. I sometimes use Reader Mode in already hard to parse through websites (ad infested sites, with anti adblocker features) and some sites don't account for those who have dyslexia. Reader Mode can bridge the gap for these people and others who might wind up on legacy / really old websites that wont be updated (thinking of Space Jam).

</p><p>I started off having problems with quite a lot of extensions installed, but I've done some investigation and so I'll describe the most basic form of the problem.
</p><p>I'm running Firefox Quantum 68.0.1 (64 bit) on Ubuntu MATE 18.04.2 LTS on a 4GB RAM VirtualBox 6.0.8 r130520 (Qt5.6.2) guest under a Windows 7 host. 3D acceleration is enabled in VirtualBox and I have the guest extensions (version 6.0.8) installed.
</p><p>To start off from a clean Firefox configuration, I move the .mozilla directory aside to some random name and start Firefox. In a new tab I visit <a href=""https://panopticlick.eff.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://panopticlick.eff.org/</a> and choose ""Test Me"". The test process starts but as it comes to the results page the tab crashes. This is a fresh configuration so there are no addons, themes or extensions other than the defaults. I've tried disabling hardware acceleration in the preferences but it doesn't fix the problem.
</p><p>If I restart Firefox in safe mode the Panopticlick site works fine.
</p><p>When the tab crashes I don't seem to get any information; about:crashes shows no crashes, perhaps because Firefox hasn't crashed, just the tab.
</p><p>What I've read so far suggests that if it works in safe mode but not otherwise the problem is an addon or extension, but I don't have any. Is there any way to get any more information about the crash?
</p><p>For what it's worth, other sites - but not all - show similar tab crashing behaviour which can be avoided by going into safe mode. <a href=""http://ebay.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.co.uk</a> seems quite prone to it, but it doesn't always go wrong immediately; I've mentioned Panopticlick above because it seems to be a reliable way of reproducing the problem and doesn't require any authentication before it goes wrong.
</p><p>Thanks.

Autoplay is reactivated and the only thing to do is to exit firefox, do a thorough cache clean then start over again.

Soon back being incredible slow. Chrome seemed to work much better and was acceptable. However while doing a test on intenet speed I got an error message from the site saying a firewall maybe preventing access. Made me think. No firewall problems on my router as my other computer with firefox on the same router was fine. Windows defender switched off.  I then remebered I accidentally ended up with real time protection from malwarebites premium trial . I did not ask fot it.  I switched real time protection malwarebites premium features off and rebooted computer . Everything fine since then. Firefox super fast and chrome a lot faster too. Hope this helps someone

The thing is why I am writing also here (also informed F-secure also), is that total privacy (that ofc is the idea of Mozilla and Thunderbird). The one part of the cyber attack or rather attacks are (tried to) hide themselves by using ie. in the Mozilla, Mozilla Dev Ed. and Thunderbird as ""fronts"" to do their illegal stealing of all private info. The attack actually pings every 2 minutes everything about what I have done (software,  settings, keylogger etc...) and sending it forwards.

</p><p>I suspect Illegal usage of MS Azure (as info is sent to both Akamai (MS Azure server base in Holland) and to Amazonaws (to be exact I suspect Amazon S3). The attack does not end there, it is also connected to my both cells (Samsung s9 and Huawei Honow  7S). WIn 10 home has client server, group admin policies, Async, Active Directory, SharedDNS etc... 
</p><p>Also information is sent to the cells by cookies and bc.googleconsent. So everything is connected together.
</p><p>I am using F-Secure safe (in both Laptop and both cells) and it can go trough and fool the anti-virus, but when looking at the ie. right of the apps on android, it seems that they have been given huge boost (the most rights I have counted is 112. Meaning that they can take over everything in my phone, make calls, close calls, find out every connection, take over bluetooth, wifi etc... Also Firefox is influenced there just as it is on the Laptop (HP Omen).
</p><p>I am sorry for my hurried input, but as the thing is so huge, I think that if the main company (Mozilla) is willing, I think this needs a direct communication, or with some other goodhearted person.
</p><p>As the spiders are collecting phone numbers, I will give it personally to anyone why is willing to help. I hope someone would be....

During the interview I had to resort to my email about scheduling details and a pop up to ""Refresh"" Firefox came up.  Being somewhat tired I allowed it.  And being partly blind I failed to notice that my Yahoo email had the  "" Say signed in"" in their default ""Go"" position.  I signed out of my email but when I reopened the computer several minutes later,I noticed all my emails were there for anyone to read.  Since this involved a patent situation, where IP stealing is always a problem, this was a concern.  I logged out and was able to closed the email access only 10 or 20 minutes after the initial breach.  But I wonder if the Firefox ""Refresh"" created a restore point so that a person with administrative authority on the computer could do a system restore to the point of Firefox ""Refresh"" and gain access to all my sensitive emails.  Unfortunately the Yahoo default ""stay signed in"" often tends to put the user in rape- ready position.  Subsequent refreshes or restarts may inadvertently leave the front door open for hacking of all your emails involving lawyers, accountants, mistresses, political improprieties etc.

There are two questions regarding the preservation of links to a web page in the form of files with the extension * .URL.
1. I opened in Firefox, for example, 50 tabs with various web pages. And I need to save each of the open web pages as a separate * .URL file. I repeat: do not bookmark all these addresses, but quickly save them as separate URL files. Is it possible to do this using the Firefox toolkit?
2. Previously, in Firefox, I could create a URL file by simply dragging the link from the address bar to Explorer or any file manager using the mouse. Now I can not do this. This option is no longer available in Firefox, or is it still possible to resolve this using settings?
Thanks in advance for your help.

</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Professional, latest updates installed (Version 1903)
</li><li> Clean Windows installation, barely any applications installed
</li><li> No Firefox add-ons installed
</li><li> Have tried reinstalling Firefox several times

</li><li> Although I think a virus is highly unlikely, I've run a full scan anyway with nothing found
</li><li> No other applications have this issue

</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Professional is running inside the latest version of Parallels Desktop
</li><li> Connected to a 4K 32"" monitor running at 100% scaling
</li><li> Changing scaling removes border but as soon as I resize once, white border reappears and I cannot resize
</li><li> Just tried disconnecting external display and running on laptop screen at various different resolutions, still no luck
</li></ul>
<p>Running inside a VM seems like the main point of difference - However I would have thought disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox would make that less relevant (instead, Firefox loses its mind with it off...).

But I wanted to be clear I have fully updated everything to the newest versions. 
</p><p>For some strange reason on most, but not all, pages where there is embedded Adobe Flash player content, Normally the content itself will work fine, but for some reason I get a Flash Plugin notification at the beginning of the address bar asking me if I want to Allow Flash player to run on the page. Even if I allow it from this popup and check the ""Remember this decision"" box, this icon still comes up even though Adobe Flash is already running on the page, and will run no problem if I come back to that page. 
</p><p>Again as far as I can tell this seems to be a minor data checking error but I was just wondering if it may be indicative of another possible problem I may want to check for.

1265349,2019-07-23 19:14:14 -0800,2019-07-24T05:09:50Z,"Firefox updated two times while my computer was asleep and I was gone. When I got back, all my bookmarks and history were gone.","<p>I simply want to add this, as it might help someone else. I'll be describing what happened, how I figured it out and how I fixed it, in the hopes that it will help someone else without them having to dig intothe middle of a 2 page answer down the page with a lot of useless into.   I can't believe I actually managed to muddle through it by myself, as I was relying on the ""help"" pages. Some of them are pretty good but some are not and some are useless. 
</p><p>Here's the deal: everytime FF downloads, I have to redo some of the settings. I keep it set so that it will not install unless I say so. It did anyway. Then 2 days later, (my computer sat idle as something else came up) FF downloaded another upgrade and installed it. This time it also reset it to install automatically, and restarted with the welcome screen, period.  I did not know this until I went to resume my work.  So when I went back to the computer, I discovered that nothing I'd left was there. AND no history or bookmarks. Confusing as hell. I tried to follow the instructions, but just went in circles.  It was trying to get me to connect with my phone, but my phone was still using the older version of FF, and it wasn't working. So I started reading the help pages and getting more and more confused and frustrated. 
</p><p>Sorry you are going to get the long version of this story because I am still venting. 
</p><p>As I was to eventually learn, FF created a new profile on my laptop and set it as default. I bet I read at least 40-50 ""help"" pages before I stumbled across that.  So typed in about:profile and there they were, Two of them. Then things got easy. Well, easier. The two were identical except for the labels and a string of numbers. And one said it was default and the other said default something else. But each had a button I could click to see them in the browser.  One was my old stuff! So I left it up while I checked the other. Yep, the bare bones one. I changed the first one, with all my goodies, to default.  
</p><p>But that meant I had to shut both down for the next step. Because I had no intention of leaving the other one on the computer, though I know it would have been harmless as long as I didn't click on it. So to make it easy, I shut down FF and opened the profile page in my FF account using another browser, double checked that I was about to delete the useless profile, and did.  Went back to FF, and it opened up looking just as it should, cluttered with tabs, all my bookmarks and history intact (I use the history as an easy way to get back to sites I use a lot in my research, - basically use it as key words.)
</p><p>Everything is as it should be now (as far as I know. With a lot less pain than the method of attack suggested elsewhere. Even managed to get the phone linked in, though I don't plan on using FF on it anymore. Another discovery along the way was Duck Duck Go. Love it as a search engine, love it even more as a clean little browser on my phone. 
</p><p>This should not have taken as much time and effort as it did. It makes sense to me now that a new profile identical to the old would behave this way. Yeah, I guess something went wrong with the migration, alright.  but why did it take people who should be familiar with it so long to figure it out?  and then made the fix more complicated than it needed to be?  And why did the second install not simply replace the one that was there? I am both inquisitive and stubborn. And if I didn't like the way FF works and have serious concerns about other browsers, I would simply have given up and gone to some other browser. Betcha some people did. 
</p><p>Ok, this is way longer than even I thought it would be, but I don't much feel like editing it down to a more reasonable length just now. Feel free.

I use Firefox as my default browser and have had no problems with it until two days ago, when it suddenly developed a massive delay. it shows up in multiple ways. When opening a webpage, my CPU will jump to about 50% and I cannot scroll for a number of seconds, as many as 10 seconds. Also, highlighting/copying/pasting operations have as much as a 10-second delay before they appear on screen, and I sometimes cannot type in a search box for several seconds or text I do type doesn't appear in a search box for several seconds. I've tried refreshing Firefox and also starting it in safe mode with add-ons disabled, but the same symptoms happen then. I uninstalled and reinstalled and that had no effect. I performed a complete uninstall using Revo uninstaller, rebooted and reinstalled and even then it still has the same symptoms, even though I haven't added any add-ons or extensions. I've run malware scans and disk cleanup with no improvement. I can browse normally with IE or Chrome and they show none of these symptoms, but I prefer Firefox. Please help me determine what suddenly changed on July 20th or 21st, 2019. I've used Firefox for years and never had a problem like this, and no amount of refreshing/reinstalling/rebooting/disabling add-ons or extensions seems to have any effect. If it comes down to a complete format/reinstall of Windows, I'll likely just use a different browser but I'd really like to get Firefox working again.

And because the rest of the address bar is reduced, it's difficult to edit the address on the fly (e.g. I want to change a single value in the url, but have to scroll to find it).  There's nothing to grab to shrink it (like between the address and search boxes); nothing on right-click; can't find any extensions that address it; DigiCert website was not helpful; internet search turned up nothing...

</p><p>I have had issues for few days now when using Google Sheets. It started last Wednesday July 17th  (everything worked smoothly on Tuesday).
</p><p>Issues: 
- big delay on commands
- slow reaction only on this page
- constant message ""website is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do?"" with options to ""wait"" or ""stop""
</p><p>After browsing for solution there was nothing aiming at this specific problem. So, my first troubleshooting step was to refresh my Firefox profile. While doing so, issue dissapeared for few seconds, but returned after. I have noticed that it was around moment my extensions started popping in browser.
</p><p>Anyways, today I opened Firefox in safe mode to troubleshoot extensions. Everything worked fine so I decided to disable extensions one by one. Since I had only 4 of them and 2 were disabled already there was no much work there.
</p><p>The last one enabled was Mozilla's Pioneer. Issue persists. I give it a go, and there it was. The one I'd suspect last. Reenabling others works pretty fine.
</p><p>So I wanted to share this if somebody stumbles upon same issue. I would also like for Mozilla to try and solve this issue with Pioneer.

My projects involve two frames...left frame is table of contents, right frame is the ""main frame"". I hide the table of contents until the mouse goes over to a certain part of the screen...when this happens, the contents frame ""pops out"". When the mouse leaves the contents frame, the frame hides itself again.
Since the last Firefox update, (July 18 2019, I believe), the pop-out / hide functions aren't working. The frames still load in, but they won't pop out or hide when they're supposed to. They stay at whatever size I resize the frame to.
In addition to this, my personal project pages are no longer loading in the fonts they are supposed to. Everything seems to be defaulting to the system (or Firefox) standard.
</p><p>More Information: The pop-out / hide functions only seemed to ever work with Firefox. I never could get it to work with Opera / Chrome / IE. This is the main reason I stuck with Firefox for so long.
</p><p>Is this an error that is going to be fixed, or a byproduct of a change that's been made that I'm just going to have to live with?
