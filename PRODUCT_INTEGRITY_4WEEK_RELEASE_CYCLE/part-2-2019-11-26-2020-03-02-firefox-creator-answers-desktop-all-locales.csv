While a great tool, I believe the companies can benefit as well. Most users have laptops. Laptops leave the confines of the office regularly. Why not have laptops configured so that they point to a companies DNS infrastructure when not in the office? The benefit would be that any filtering/monitoring being done via DNS no longer is limited to when devices are on the company network!
</p><p>This would require companies exposing DNS to the internet which is considered a bad idea. DNS will expose internal secrets and let the bad guys probe the architecture of the network for information they can use later. Adding authentication to the DoH solution would allow companies to leverage their internal certificate infrastructure and already deployed client certificates to protect that DNS information.
</p><p>TLS mutual auth via client certificates is part of the SSL/TLS protocol already in use by DoH and there is nothing in the RFC to prevent this from being a possibility.
</p><p>Is this something that can be added to the roadmap (or is it already on the roadmap)?

Along the course of the years, I found out that inverting the text-background colors is a good practice to reduce the eye-straining and increase my reading speed. 
</p><p>To achieve this in Firefox, I installed ""Dark Background Light Text"" add-on and it I used to work out extremely good.
However, in June 2018 (Firefox 61) this add-on lost the priviledge to operate in the embedded PDF viewer.  This is extremely painful (considering that on average I open 40-50 PDF per week), and I often I have to download/open the documents outside Firefox. This often turns out to be a disrupting process, that makes me lose focus when swapping back and forth between the PDF viewer, my IDE and the browser.
</p><p>I don't know whether there is a way to activate this feature and I think I made a couple of requests to implement it, but, as of now,  I've never received any answer. What makes things worse the Firefox's PDF viewer is the __only__ viewer that doesn't support this feature natively. Is there a way to enable this in Firefox? (I could be as desperate as to try to volunteer to implementing it in the code myself)

</p><p>note: while i used youtube as an example here this problem happens ALL across the internet on ANY website regardless of whether or not the audio is coming from a video player, audio player, or anything else like a fricking flash game of all things.
</p><p>the memory leak had a temporary fix where you could periodically reboot the browser. this? this is 100% random with NO way of predicting when or where it'll happen next. as for why i brought up the memory leak issue...easy comparison for a problem that went unresolved for MANY years.

For the uploaded image: On the left, following my instructions for the referenced question. On the right, the favorites menu while browsing.
For the Browsing bookmarks (right), you see a double separator between/below the in/out box icon of ""Other Bookmarks"" and above the Folder icon ""Other Bookmarks"". On the left you see only a Single separator or none in the same place.

Next, I found the places.sqlite file will update automatically without shutting down Firefox (most likely when the computer is put to sleep and then awakened). A warning about this little known file updating would be helpful to those who learned about their lost history, but choose to wait until later, like recovering it prior to shutting down, but they will have lost the opportunity when the places.sqlite file self updates itself automatically (who knows exactly when or why)  I'd like to see this important information placed your answer on this same (above) troubleshooting page, because when I loose history caused by a proper shut down, I'll need to your page infor to remind me what to be cautious about. And I don't believe you have created a back up file to places.sqlite to which I can recover and rename yet, because I believe the closest name to it has very little memory in it, but I could be wrong.

After upgrading to an ethernet cable and getting much faster internet speeds (around 70mbps on the speed test), I've noticed that for whatever reason, Firefox is actually running slower than it did when I had worse internet connection through Wi-Fi signal. Websites can take minutes to fully load. When checking the task manager, it shows that Firefox's network speed is either 0.1mbps or 0mbps. This can be somewhat inconsistent, for example YouTube's homepage is able to load somewhat quickly, however videos can take a few refreshes. This is also sometimes a problem on a few other programs like Discord, but it's never been a problem on Edge (which is where I'm writing this). Is there any way to fix this?

I'd like to set up 2 different profiles: one for email, banking and other sensitive stuff and the other for general web surfing.
Honestly, so far I've used Firefox for the first job and Chrome for the second one.
Now I would like to try to set-up 2 profiles in Firefox to use it for both purposes
While I used to use 2 different browsers before, now I would use the same browser, which can access both profiles.
I'm afraid that if I browse with my hobby profile, a possible threat could easily access or compromise the data of the second profile. 
Is the solution of using 2 different browsers actually more secure?
What if I use the stable version together with the beta version of Firefox instead?
I would like clarification on this.
Thanks

Right now, employees use outdated FF 50, and I need to convince the management to upgrade the version to current.
HTTPS is required for webcam access starting with FF 68. We've got over 300 app installations, and HTTPS is not viable in our situation.
I've found two preferences in about:config, media.devices.insecure.enabled, media.getusermedia.insecure.enabled, and photo can be taken by clicking Allow every time. When I click ""Remember this decision"" checkbox, Allow button becomes disabled, and FF displays message ""Your connection to this site is not secure. To protect you, Firefox will only allow access for this session"".
</p><p>App is hosted on one fixed internal IP address and users probably don't have access to Internet.
Can I do something to fight this behavior? Users should be able to allow permanent access to webcam.
</p><p>PS. Upgrade was delayed by <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2851"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2851</a> - we've used Adobe plugin instead.

This way by edging more and more overtime, users will by blind to how much access ""privacy""add-ons even get.)
</p><p>My privacy is mine..... so any short-falls like more access when it previously worked ok is an instant 'red flag' to me... and would be with anything.

I understand, Firefox sync won't sync customized UI, and add-on settings.

Why do all add-ons in PC-A have a reset?  For example, an add-on foxclocks was added in PC-A at beginning, lots of city were added. But after fresh setup of firefox in PC-B, the city list in this add-on will be reverted to default list. And other add-on has the same behavior. 
Why do the theme in PC-A revert back to default? If I applied a theme on firefox of PC-A first. Then I sign in in the fresh installed firefox on PC-B, The theme of PC-A will be synced to the default theme, like the PC-B one. 
I know the sync should be bi-direction. But the setting of PC-A is already exited in server. And setting of PC-B is all default like blank paper. So the sync of PC-B should be download only, instead of upload default settings.

I tried adding it as an option with ""Change Program: Other Programs"" which allows me to set up Google Chrome as the default for opening JPGs, but it won't allow me to set Firefox.

It overwrites to whatever selected device master out preventing the audio from being properly routed according to the ""Audio MIDI Setup"" standard Apple macOS Audio Setup. If you need to route to a Quadraphonic, or anything other than Stereo you won't be able to do it. If you need to route the audio through a special set of virtual audio channels where you can add compressors, EQ, filters, it will not let you. Google Chrome and Safari do this right without any need to change any settings or configurations on the browser side, all you need to do is configure the System-Wide Audio Settings in ""Audio MIDI Setup"", which is the only way and standard to the audio configuration on any macOS systems.
</p><p>I am a Linux/Unix System Administrator/Engineer, and I also work with Music Production using special professional interfaces from UA United Audio Apollo x8p and Focusrite. Those interfaces are connected to different sets of speakers, and they also have virtual audio channels where you can add a chain of plugins to treat the audio signal passing through them.
</p><p>This behavior should be considered a bug, although it is probably by design, which needs to be changed to adhere to the macOS system configuration standards for audio routing.
</p><p>I tested this with the latest and greatest stable Firefox version, Google Chrome, and Safari. The only browser misbehaving is the Mozilla Firefox.

The audio sounds like it is lower bit-rate with a total loss in low frequencies.  You can literally play the same video in one browser, stop it, switch to the other, and immediately notice the difference.
</p><p>Is this a Firefox caused issue, or do the Chromium based browsers support an audio transport that Firefox does not?  I'd hate to think that Google is just purposely using lower bit-rates on browsers other than theirs for no technical reason.
</p><p>How to Reproduce
1) Open Firefox to a youtube music video on VEMO channel (professional official music videos)
2) Open Chrome to the same URL/Video
3) Play the video on one browser at a time, switching back and forth to hear the difference.

I did (another) refresh and still, same speeds.
</p><p>Is there a way to 100% remove Firefox and reinstall?  I want my laptop/Firefox to treat each other as never have met, in hopes that I can install and get the speeds I should be getting.

Description:
</p><p>Repeats each time I press play button on this video frame on that specific page. Tab crashes after such actions repeated after restoration of a tab, in a new tab, also in another window.
After some single tab crashes, now any tab with YouTube that's being loaded crashes automatically after a while (DOM loaded as well as video previews, but after some time close to 1-2 sec tab crashes). Issue repeats in safe mode.

Environment details:

<ul><li> Firefox 73.0 mint 1.0
</li><li> Linux Mint 19, Kernel 4.15.0-88, Cinnamon DE
</li><li> GPU: Nvidia GTX 960 (driver version 418.87.00)
</li><li> CPU/GPU/RAM/Swap/HDD are looking normal
</li><li> /tmp directory is full!
</li><li> One day I switched media.rdd-process.enabled option in about:config to false ( don't ask why ;) ). Even if I make it true as default, tabs are still crashing
</li><li> Used that version of firefox for some time - worked perfectly. This issue revealed only today on that specific URL
</li></ul>

My conjectures:
</p><p>Conjecture #1: YouTube has broken something today
</p><p>Conjecture #2: Some time related stuff (date is 28.02.2019 03:00:00 MSK - so by UTC it's 00:00:00 which is strange)
</p><p>Conjecture #3: This video has a present from Mao with some malicious stuff inside ( still hope my PC won't blow up this morning :P )
</p><p>Conjecture #4: Temp directory is full and that causes quite heavy YT tabs to crash (maybe, if firefox uses /tmp, idk)

So in FF72 and all previous versions double tapping on YouTube videos switched between fullscreen and windowed modes of said videos, yet with FF73 for some reason double tapping now does fast forward/fast backwards 10 seconds actions depending on where I tap on the screen, which is something I understand is an expected behaviour on Android and other mobile oriented operating systems.
I hate it and want double tap to go to it's old functionality. Going back to FF72 does fix the problem, so the problem is not on YouTube's end. Also going back to the previous version of FF creates a whole set of annoying problems, so it's obviously not optimal.
I wonder if there is some hidden config setting introduced in FF73 that tells YouTube I'm on a tablet specifically, which was not previously shared? Any ideas?

The problem with them is that they start ""discarded"" so still don't trigger the need to enter the password. 
</p><p>Ultimately, this needs to be resolved. It's a deal breaker to have to put a different start page. And as it is, it can take from about 10 seconds (rarely) to more than 10 minutes (often). This doesn't work for me and needs to be resolved in a way where it asks for the password upon opening the browser.

I was then directed to Safari and was successful in printing.  I use Firefox because my use of Safari is limited.  It is not my #1 browser.  Does Firefox need to be fixed?

Is there a way to force users to open that link in Firefox rather than in their current browser? On my homepage and in the menu, I would like to link that page so that it opens in Firefox. What do I need to add to &lt;a href&gt; tag for it to happen?
I want just that one link to be opened in Firefox, so it is no help to suggest a solution which forces users to open all links in Firefox, like adding a code in &lt;head&gt; tag.
Thank you in advance.

I know it is not legitimate. The grammar is weird and word choice is odd. The Microsoft Support phone number on the page is also incorrect. 
Any concerns I should have? I have run a full scan with Windows defender without any issues showing up. Have not noticed any unusual processes running.

</p><p>I however have found that I'm unable to do so on any browser, all except Microsoft Edge. Even when I run the browsers in privacy mode, I still get the same issue...
</p><p>When it comes to the 'Pre-order' or 'Login' screens, I just see a spinning circle, as though the browser is waiting for something. This includes all browsers, including Firefox, Chrome &amp; IE... All on the same machine that it will work on Microsoft Edge.
</p><p>On another front, everything will work OK, when trying it on my phone.

When I open Google Chrome or Microsoft edge I am immediately connected to websites with no problem. I have researched this problem, switched off Microsoft Firewall, and added Firefox to my list in Malwarebytes Premium. It seems to run okay for a few day6s and then the problem returns? Everything okay this morning, all good. Closed Firefox, went had some lunch and when I opened again it refused to connect me to the net, but Google chrome and Edge does? I'm at my wits end now. It's clearly not a internet connection problem else I wouldn't be able to use Chrome or edge? This seems to be something in Firefox that is cutting me off.

</p><p>Basically, I plan to migrate my existing mobile and desktop website to single PWA based responsive website. Right now, I have mobile website which is a PWA, and a desktop website. Goal is to have a single PWA based responsive website for both mobile and desktop platform. However, I want to make sure the proposed website will work with Firefox desktop. From what I could find Firefox doesn't support option to install PWA as an app with it's own shortcut as it is possible in Chrome. But I want to make sure it supports rest of the features of PWA, and website still works correctly in terms of UI and experience as in case when it is accessed from Chrome browser.
</p><p>Appreciate a response on this. In case you require more clarity on the problem statement, do let me know.

I have this problem once every few years, So far I havent managed to set up anythng that works reliably to get me out of the mess.
I use FF and have over 1000 tabs. 99% of the time 'restore session from before' after reboot works automatically great.  Obviously with that many tabs things slow down, I then use CCLEANER to clear up and reboot.Today I forgot I had mutliple unimportant firefox windows open in addition to my MOTHERLOAD firefox window. I closed my session in perhaps some haphazzard order. On restarting I only had my unimportant windows open. 
I have not restarted after this Im still sitting in the new session.
I have yet to find a consistent way to backup my open tabs. In the past I had an addon which wrote my tabs to a file but that addon got dumped after an update to FF.
I REALLY REALLY dont want to lose my list of tabs as I wont be able to get this info back
But more that this what is the safest way to back this info up on a regular basis in a way that I can get back to it? The current way is not 100% foolproof. :(
</p><p>I have no history showing in FF as CCleaner removes all that (session data isnt removed). I assume I might have restore or previous restore files? Really not sure where to look. Im on Windows 10. Im not even sure where to look anymore for the sessonrestore file. Perhaps it doesnt save it when it isnt the last window to be closed??? Im reluctant to close this session now too. (Hope all my terminology is correct. Is it a window has mutiple tabs, you can have more than one window all of which comprise the session.)

No matter how I go to FB, it will say at the bottom ""...transferring data from"", but then it will stop and screen just goes white. Sometimes it says, ""Something went wrong"".
I have tried clearing all the date in Firefox and using CCleaner.  
I have tried starting in safe mode.
I have tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling.
Nothing works, but ever other page works just fine on both computers.
Anything you have to suggest would be greatly appreciate it. It is, by far, my favorite browser and I hate to have to use another one just for FB.

</p><p>SEARCH FILE TYPES AND APPLICATIONS (for downloads) I HAVE NO IDEA, Using Windows 7 was very easy, I just named the file in SAVE  AS there was a drop down box for downloads, documents, etc. WHY WOULD anyone want their downloads in MS Outlook?  As it stands now, I don't know where most of my downloads, documents, photos are located in Firefox. Even in Outlook 365 Word they are all over the place. DO NOT want them in Outlook Word, which is where they seem to go. I have selected web site addresses to download, instead of ""save as"" it wants the FILE TYPE. I hate every program on my PC, want Windows 7 back and Outlook 2013. I thought Firefox would be easier, heard good things, but right now I could throw it out the window. BTW, I have logged into Grammarly 4 times today, and once again it's asking me to login. I have more logins now than ever before in my computer lifetime. I'm not IT and an engineer, half the words used these days are Greek to me. Been working with computers for over 40 years, DOS, most of Windows programs or Apps or whatever they called these days, always a learning curve, but after 5 months, it's only gotten worse. Every phone call to MS support is a JOKE. 1 person says this, another persons says oh no this is what you need to do!! Printer no longer works after MS big PATCH. I dread calling HP again, but have no choice.
Sorry I have just dumped all over you, but I am so angry with all of this I have screamed!

I log in to <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>. The screen comes up normally with the Folders Pane on the Left, the E-mail Title Pane in the middle and the smaller Preview pane on the right of the screen.

A few days ago the problem started that now when I double click on the middle Title Pane a message pops up ""You May Now Close This Window"". I can't get the e-mail to appear in the expanded middle pane. I switched to Chrome which is an alternate Browser that I use and I Did Not Have This Problem. Apparently the problem is caused by a change that Firefox made in the last few days. I have used Firefox as my default Browser for many years now and love this Browser. I have tried everything I could think of including allowing Popups for the <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> website, and clearing the Firefox cache, but the problem still exists. Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I do not want to have to use another Browser other than Firefox. I will be upgrading to Windows 10 from 7 in the next few weeks, but I'm not sure Windows 7 is the issue since <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> works with no problems with Windows 7 using the Chrome Browser.

I have comodo and peerblock installed, but I turned them off during the download and installation. I rolled back to 43 and for the moment it seems to be working fine. I'm on Windows 7. I've found questions similar to this, but not exactly the same. One suggested using version 72, but that didn't solve the problem.
</p><p>Thanks very much.

1280473,2020-02-22 13:41:27 -0800,2020-02-22T23:57:20Z,"When adding a new Bookmark, I cannot choose a new folder from the Dropdown to save to","<p>I am in the process of migrating over to Firefox from Chrome.  But seem to have issues with Bookmarks (Not importing them, but just the simple action of adding a new bookmark and saving them to whatever folder I want to organize it into)..  When I go to add a new Bookmark (clicking the Star Icon in the Address Bar), and I go to click the dropdown to choose a folder to where I want it saved, it always reverts back when I choose another folder.
</p><p>Steps:
</p><p>1. Go to website
</p><p>2. Click the Star Icon to add bookmark
</p><p>3. The folder option is usually set to the most recent folder a Bookmark was previously added to.
</p><p>4. Click the Folder dropdown (NOT the icon that shows all folders, but the actual dropdown) and select a new folder
</p><p>5. As soon as I select a new folder (doesn't matter where), it reverts back to the folder it was set to (in Step 3). 
</p><p><br>
The behavior seems to add the Bookmark to the location, but then does a ""CTL+Z"" (Undo so to speak), as seen when I try to add the new Bookmark to the Bookmarks Toolbar, I see it there for half a second before it reverts.
</p><p><br>
The only way for me to move the location of the bookmark where I want it saved is to:
</p><p>1.  Hit the button next to the Folders dropdown to Show All Bookmarks Folders and select the folder
</p><p>or
</p><p>2.  In the Folders dropdown, select ""Choose..."" which does Step 1 in showing all the bookmarks folders.
</p><p><br>
If I restart Firefox, it will work, for the FIRST Bookmark I add.  I can use the dropdown to save the Bookmark to whatever folder I choose.  But any new bookmark after that, reverts to the problem behavior again.
</p><p>I have tried to do a clean Install of Firefox (Uninstall Firefox, then Delete %AppData%/Roaming.Mozilla/Firefox and %AppData%/Local/Mozilla/Firefox folders respectively)
</p><p>I have also disabled all extensions, and the behavior still persists (For reference I have the following extensions installed: 1Password, Alternate Player for Twitch, Clippings, Facebook Container, NoScript and uBlock Origin).
</p><p>Not sure what other steps I can take?  
</p><p>(Is there a way for me to create a gif showing this behavior?)

These problems does not always happens, but they does repeat from time to time. I think the problem is related to Firefox on Ubuntu.
</p><p>Problems:
- First, changing language input cases Firefox to become a little slow and lose focus for a second or less.
</p><p>- duckduckgo: Not the main site, but after making a search (for example: <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=test)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=test)</a>. If you are on this site and change language input, and then press ""h"" it selects all the search text. pressing ""v"" shows a message that Firefox has prevented a pop-up (which is the first search result. If you allow pop-up, it will open that result).
</p><p>- Facebook: When writing in the mini-chat, changing language input makes the chat to lose focus. Writing when the chat is in that state can cause the chat to disappear. It seems like the chat element is blocked from HTML, even if I click on chats or contacts to open a new chat, the chat does not appear any more. Moving from a Facebook link to another by clicking on page elements (using ajax) does not remove that ""block"". The only solution is to reload the page.

When clicking the icon it bounces once and then disappears from the dock. Honestly, this started happening about August 2018, and in my troubleshooting decided to give the Developer edition a try, and for some reason that one worked so I stuck with it.
</p><p>Shortly thereafter (a week or two) whenever I closed down the Mac, Firefox Dev wouldn't re-open. Deleting and reinstalling would work, but I'd have to re-set all my settings, re-activate the theme, etc., and all the browsing history would be lost. So, since then I would rarely shut it down. 
</p><p>A few days ago I had to shut the Mac down completely, but this time Firefox Dev wouldn't open after re-installing. Oddly, I tried regular Firefox again as a solution, and it opened this time. I tested it out by shutting the Mac down completely, then restarting, and it retained all of the settings! I was really glad to once again be able to shut down my laptop at the end of the day without the headache of having to reinstall and re-set everything.
</p><p>Then this morning, boom - back to the same nonsense, except now it won't open at all. Neither the regular FF or the Developer edition will work. I've done clean uninstalls to see if that was the problem, as in: removed them from the Applications folder, removed them from the Downloads folder, removed the /Firefox folder from user/Library/Application Support/, and emptying the Trash.
</p><p>I saw in one Support post to delete the fbplugin file, 'as that had been causing Firefox to crash'. The closest I found to an 'fbplugin' file was a bundle-config.1 file, which contained 'fbplugin' throughout the file code numerous times. I renamed it temporarily, but didn't delete it. That didn't help the non-opening problem either.  
</p><p>I also tried installing Firefox v 71, same result as the others.
</p><p>Keep in mind after attempting all of these solutions of deleting, reinstalling, changing file names, etc., I did a complete shutdown and restart.  Also, I have not downloaded, updated, or changed anything since last week's phenomenon of regular Firefox beginning to work again.  So I'm completely stumped and would appreciate any help.  I'm currently running macOS Catalina 10.15.3.  TIA.

-Restarting Firefox
-Restarting Firefox in Safe Mode
-Clearing Cookies &amp; Cache
-Removing all addons and plugins
-Restarting PC
-Reinstalling Firefox
-""Refreshing"" Firefox 
-Making a new account
-Restarting Firefox in Safe Mode after reinstall/refresh/new account
-Checking browser internals
-Troubleshooting/Reinstalling Flash
-Checking for security software/malware issues
-Switching browser.tabs.remote.autostart to false
-Switching media.wmf.vp8.enabled to false
-Checking that drivers are up to date
-Switching to an older version of Firefox
-Making a new profile for an older version of Firefox
-Re-reverting to the current version of Firefox
-Restarting PC another time and trying these again
</p><p>Despite all of this, all tabs save for the about:tabs (excluding about:blank) crash immediately. I have no idea what else I can try, and any assistance would be appreciated.

</p><p>I'm using Firefox Sync for longer to sync bookmarks and logins between Firefoxes on my private Linux box and Firefox on a private Android Smartphone.
</p><p>As I wanted to have my logins (esp. their usually nowadays pretty complex passwords :-)) also available on my company's laptop's Firefox, but ONLY the logins, NOT the (many) bookmarks, don't want to mix business bookmarks with private ones, I've enbled Firefox Sync for the first time on the company#s laptop.
</p><p>Unfortunately Firefox Sync took ALL information possible, bookmarks, logins and even history, and synced it to my Android also. Bidirectional! 
Some work to wipe this.
There has been no option in the phase of connecting my company's laptop to Firefox sync to select the sync scope itself, unfortunately. 
</p><p>- Is this ""working as designed""? Or did I miss something?
</p><p>Before wiping both my company's laptop and my Android, I've set the sync options to ""Logins only"" on the company's laptop. To be sure NOT to get any wiped bookmarks deleted at their origins/source Firefoxes. 
</p><p>Having done this. my Android Sync settings have been also set (automatically?) to ""Logins only"", no Bookmarks sync anymore. 
</p><p>- I this correct? Only one sync options set valid for ALL devices ""belonging"" to a Firefox Sync account? 
Docs are somewhat vague about this, at least what I've found here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-choose-what-types-information-sync-firefox#w_manage-sync-information-on-a-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-choose-what-types-information-sync-firefox#w_manage-sync-information-on-a-computer</a>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure about ""automatically set"", but because of the work to get things sorted out after the unwanted sync I do not want to test again :-S

I had tested some Webrtc samples and website with Firefox 68.4.1ESR on Linux system of Raspberry Pi 3. They all return some errors.
For example, AppRTC video chat client powered by Google App Engine:  <a href=""https://appr.tc/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://appr.tc/</a>
The result  is showing like the images. It can't show the device name when I accept the camera and microphone permission then return error message.
Then I tried Firefox 60, it works fine with Webrtc sample on Raspberry Pi 3.
As a final test, I downloaded the Firefox 68.4.1ESR version at my laptop with Win10 system and test it. Everything is fine.
I am sure the camera and microphone is fine because Firefox 60 can run the sample normally.
May I get some help to figure out the problem of the Firefox 68.4.1ESR on the Raspberry Pi with Linux system and how can I make it work with Webrtc?

</p><p>I would find it very useful to be able to designate a default container (which could be ""No Container"") for sites that are not already assigned to a container.  In other words, with this feature, if a link is opened from a page in container X, but the link does not have a container associated with it, the tab would open in the default container rather than container X.  To give a concrete example:  My Google searches &amp; news are in a Google container.  When I click a search result, e.g., from a news organization that I don't visit enough to make a container for, I'd prefer it did not open in the Google container, but a different, generic one or No Container.
</p><p>I realize there could be some odd side-effects if a site spans multiple domains or hosts if they're not all marked for one container, but as an optional feature I think it wouldn't bother people who don't want to deal with that possibility.
</p><p>Another way to do something similar would be to allow users to mark a container as ""exclusive,"" meaning any link not in the sites assigned to that container would automatically go to No Container in the absence of an assignment.  These two options also be implemented and work together.
</p><p>Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this or if there's already a way to do this that I just haven't found.  Thanks for any help!

It won't search, won't let me log in to sync. Nothing.

1280123,2020-02-17 17:27:10 -0800,2020-02-17T20:21:31Z,Version 73.0 I need to Disable background images,"<p>Greetings
In version 73.0 of Feb 11, 2020 Mozilla introduced a “readability backplate” solution which places a block of background color between the text and background image.
As a Low vision individual I do rely on Windows High contrast black theme to remove any bright color blocks from the screen background.
Unfortunately the new Readability backplate feature brings these color blocks back which actually make websites harder for me to read. 
For example buttons, image blocks with or without wording  now appear in white background which is precisely what I need to move away from.
Can I disable the readability backplate or disable background images?
In the mean time how do I go back to version 72.# please?
Thank you

This add on not only put tabs not in use into hibernation, but when you closed a tab it went into a recent tab list. Now Firefox browser does the same, but when the browser is closed the list is deleted, but with Tab Utilities the list remained. If there was tabs you wanted to delete you could click on it with your mouse's right button. If you wanted to pull up a tab you hit the tab with your mouse's left button and the tab would once more be on the tab work bar in the same place it was once before. In this ""recently closed"" list you could edit the amount of tabs you desired in the list and the tabs were in hibernation, as such using very little energy and little interference with speed besides freeing up your work tab bar.
The author of the add on eventually quit and the add on became incompatible after Firefox version 44 and is disabled on installing the newer versions. 
So many of us are having an older version of Firefox. Some of us would like to get the newer version of Firefox. Currently, the only options we have in locating  a newer add on similar to Tab Utilities is by installing a newer version of Firefox, and losing all we had, and install new add ons hopefully finding what we desire.  So, we (it is not just me, but a large group of people I am in contact with) are searching for some new add on that is similar to Tab Utilities so we can move on to the newer Firefox versions. Is there such an add on, and if so what is it's name and how does one find it?

Task Manager also only lists the processes, no applications. This process is very hard to kill, Task Manager can't end it, nor elevated rights Command Prompt TASKKILL with /FE, NirSoft NirCmd nor PSTools pskill64.exe nor Process Explorer. I have also tried ending all the other processes first I can think of, including explorer.exe, does not help.

For couple of weeks ago it updated with a new user interface and installed new components. To test that, I tried to uninstall Avira. Each component needs to be uninstalled separately using Windows Programs and Features: two components uninstalled cleanly, one component left an open minimized window that one couldn't pop open nor close. Antivirus and VPN do not uninstall: after you are asked do you want to uninstall and answer YES, nothing else visible happens. If you try to start another uninstall job, you get a window telling you can't start another as one program is already being uninstalled or changed. And waiting doesn't help. I have a support question about it in Avira forum.
</p><p>Also last week, Flash Player installation failed with 89% done, tried twice and with same result. And the newest GeForce Graphics adapter drivers installation failed also. Both of those usually always install succesfully.
</p><p>Microsoft System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW does not find problems, nor does Windows disc chechker tool. I also run: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab and Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter
MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Avira support recommends the Install and Uninstall troubleshooter to get rid of some old Avira rubbish. Also compared Windows folders rights to default rights listed in some web site: did not find differences with the couple of dozen folders I compared. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) according to Process Explorer is enabled looking at Firefox.exe process properties. I know command lines to change DEP settings and found it in System Performance Properties settings also, but have not touched it.
</p><p>I've removed Firefox and Thunderbird parent.lock -files, with Firefoxilla both from profile folder C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME and temporary folder C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox before trying to start Firefox again. And since I can't kill the process otherwise, it also means after rebooting the computer.
</p><p>Found an advice opening Firefox with SHIFT-key down, should open a safe-mode of the browser. Well, opened
only the process in my case.
</p><p>There are no previous session related saves (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js)
in the profile folder any more, and the sessionstore-backups folder is empty.
</p><p>I removed the Firefox installation, rebooted, and installed the 73.0 version 13.02.2020. It behaves similarly:
only the process starts.
</p><p>Added -p parameter to the Firefox shortcut, and in Windows SAFE MODE  was able to create a new profile: in normal mode Windows the window for creating/changing profile does not open. Firefox doesn't open application window in Windows safe mode either, also tried to run it as administrator option, and pressing SHIFT key, but neither helped. The newly created profile folder only has one file: times.json.
</p><p>When installed Firefox again, it wasn't a clean installation: the Firefox folder was empty of files, but I did install into the same folder. Also did not edit register nor delete the profile folder. Which is what I'm gonna try next. However, Thunderbird does not use Firefox's profile, so why does it stop opening the application window same time with Firefox? I don't think Firefox's profile folder can cause all these installation problems and Thunderbird problem. My bet is more likely Avira.

Koska itsellä Firefox ei toimi, en ole omalla koneellani, kun täällä foorumilla olen. Joten jos tähän viestiin automaattisesti jotain tietoja lisätään... tulee väärästä koneesta.
</p><p>Vajaa viikko sitten Mozilla Firefox ja Thunderbird lakkasivat aukeamasta: vain prosessi - Firefox.exe tai Thunderbird.exe - käynnistyy (näkyvissä Tehtävien hallinnassa (Task Managerissa)) mutta sovellusikkuna ei aukea, eikä myöskään ole listattuna Task Managerin sovelluksissa. Prosessi on myös vaikeasti tapettava: sitä ei saa lopetettua Task Managerista eikä ohjelmilla jotka on tarkoitettu prosessien lopettamiseen: järjestelmänvalvojan oikeuksilla avatussa komentokehoitteessa TASKKILL PID /FE, NirSoft NirCmd
ja PSTools pskill64.exe tai Process Explorer. Vaikka käynnistysongelma on molemmilla Mozillan ohjelmilla, olen koittanut ratkoa sitä lähinnä Firefoxin kanssa.
</p><p>Ympäristö: Pöytäkone, Windows 7 PRO 64bit eng. kielinen, AMD:n Phenom II prossu, GeForce 1050Ti näyttis, ja kaksi järjestelmänvalvojan tason tunnusta on joilla olen hommaa ratkonut.
</p><p>Virustorjuntana Avira Free Antivirus, joka voi olla jopa syntipukki. Siitä tuli nimittäin viikko-pari sitten uudella käyttöliittymällä oleva päivitys, jossa oli muitakin uusia komponentteja. Olen koittanut poistaa sen asennusta, mutta kaksi komponenttia siitä ei suostu Windowsin Programs and Features -asennuksen poistolla katoamaan: Antivirus ja VPN. Tukikysely siitä menossa Aviran foorumilla.
</p><p>Viime viikolla epäonnistui myös Adobe Flash-player asennus (pysähtyi 89% kohtaan) sekä GeForce näytönohjaimen ajureiden päivitys uusimpaan versioon.
</p><p>System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW ei löydä ongelmia, eikä Windows levynkorjaustyökalu. Kokeilin myös Microsoftin työkaluja: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab sekä Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter
MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Install ja Uninstall troublesooter -työkalulla koitin poistaa myös mahdollisesti wanhojen Aviran asennusten jäämiä (Aviran tuki suosittelee myös niin tekemään). Vertailin myös Windows kansioiden käyttäjäoikeuksia alkuperäisiin (Netistä löytyi sivu jolla niistä on listaus) enkä havainnut erilaisuuksia niissä muutamassa tusinassa jonka tarkistin. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) näkyi olevan Process Explorerin mukaan olevan päällä (Enabled) Firefox-prosessinkin ominaisuuksia katsoessa, en ole siihen itse kajonnut, löysin kyllä sen asetuksen Windowsin järjestelmän suorituskyvyn ominaisuuksista, ja komentokehoiteohjeet, jos nyt siitä kiikastaisi.  
</p><p>Firefoxista ja Thunderbirdistä olen poistanut parent.lock -tiedostot, Firefoxilla sekä profiilikansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME sekä väliaikaistalletusten kansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox ennen kuin olen käynnistänyt selainta uudestaan, ja koska prosessia ei saa tapettua, se tarkoittaa siis että aina koneen uudelleenkäynnistymisen jälkeen.
</p><p>Löysin neuvon avata Firefox klikkaamalla kuvaketta ja pitämällä SHIFT-näppäintä pohjassa, mutta sillä ei ollut eroa mun tapauksessani: vain prosessi käynnistyy.
</p><p>Profiilista olen poistanut edellisen istunnon tiedostot (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js)
ja sessionstore-backups kansio on tyhjä.
</p><p>Poistin Firefoxin asennuksen, boottasin ja asensin uusimman 73.0 version 13.02.2020. Sama ongelma jatkui senkin kanssa.
</p><p>Lisäsin kuvakkeeseen käynnistyspolun perään -P argumentin, ja Windowsin SAFE-modessa sillä sai käynnistymään ikkunan jossa voi luoda uuden profiilin ja valita mitä profiilia käytetään. Jos käynnisti Windowsin normaalisti, niin tuokaan ikkuna ei aukea. Firefox ei kyllä käynnistynyt Windowsin SAFE-modessakaan. Kokeilin myös Run as administrator ja SHIFT-napin kanssa, mutta ei käynnisty. Uuteen profiiliin tuli vain yksi ainoa tiedosto: times.json.
</p><p>Kun asensin uuden version Firefoxista, se ei ollut aivan ""clean Install"", eli asensin saman nimiseen kansioon, joka kyllä oli tyhjä tiedostoista, enkä käynyt rekisteriä läpi, enkä poistanut edellistä profiilia. Mikä lieneekin seuraava yritys. Joku neuvoi myös place.sqlite -tiedostoa poistamaan/uudelleennimeämään, jota voin kanssa kokeilla. Tässä on nyt kuitenkin huomionarvoista se, että Firefoxin lisäksi Thunderbird alkoi samalla hetkellä käyttäytymään samalla tavalla. Ja sehän ei ilmeisesti mitenkään Firefoxin profiilia käytä, joten epäilen kyllä Aviraakin enemmän kuin että Firefoxin profiili olisi tähän kaikkeen syypää.

The response of the pointer is slow as is the response of any 'click'.
I have 8.0 Gb of RAM 64 bit system.
I have gone into task manager and noticed that there were several line items open under firefox, I have limited these to three since then bu am not convinced that was an issue. What I have also noticed is that all of them show a last accessed date of over 15 hours ago. The computer has been off since then and restarted several times. 
System is still slow.
I also have over 70 lines of svchost.exe files open in the task manager. None of them show a lot of activity I just think that is odd.

It used to work fine for years until a certain point, but I cannot pinpoint when it went wrong and the possible whys. Note that the body of the mail is formatted regularly, and that also the icons at the bottom (say, an attachment) are magnified disproportionately.
</p><p>There is an archived post in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176032"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176032</a> that reports a similar problem. However, the diagnose is different. The large icon is not an issue of yahoo mail on two counts: 1) the big X and printer icons are supposed to be there, and the issue is that they are magnified without a reason; 2) the problem does not arise with the same webmail service in other computers. I suspect that it must be some local setting of Firefox that has been changed in a mistake?

How can I set the window size (1024x768 or 1366x768 or another) that I need? So that I open the browser and the window size matches the resolution I need.
</p><p>What I did:
</p><p>Set the values to `privacy.window.maxInnerHeight` and `privacy.window.maxInnerWidth`. But the size is 1000x700, 1400x800, etc., i.e. not the one i need.
</p><p>Used `privacy.resistfingerprinting.letterboxing` with the specified resolution in `.dimensions`, it seems to work. BUT, this works with a delay. I open a test page in which resolution is displayed through `&lt;body onload=""alert (window.innerWidth)""&gt;` and at the very beginning the real value is displayed and only then changed using letterboxing. That is, it is possible to intercept the real value.
</p><p>I tried to resize the window through `Window.resizeTo ()`, but it does not change.
</p><p>Tell me how to launch a browser with a window of the desired size with privacy.resistfingerprinting enabled?

</p><p>Firefox versions 70-74, developer version and stable;
Ubuntu 19.10 with Wayland/ Sway;
Internal Monitor 3000x2000 with scaling ratio 2.0 + External Monitor 1920x1080 with scaling ratio 1.0  
</p><p>Ever since version 70 I noticed that Firefox would on first start scale either according to the external or internal monitor, and be perfectly workable on that one. But when moving it to the other monitor/ opening a new window on the other monitor it would not scale properly, but render according to the scaling factor of the other monitor. So, e.g. when moving from the internal to the external screen it would only render to the top left quarter of the screen, while the application was actually being the right size. At the same time the input mapping was according to the actual window dimensions, and not according to the visual rendering of Firefox. This would also happen the other way round, with Firefox then only rendering the top left part of the web page to the entire screen.
</p><p>You can see this well on the attached screenshot, but notice that sway is a tiling window manager, so Firefox should actually be exactly the same size as the terminal next to it. Firefox also renders like this when the scaling factor was changed at run time, so the issue seems to me that Firefox on Wayland checks the scaling factor on startup just once globally and does not realize when it was changed or that it can be different on different monitors.

I followed the troubleshooting steps posted in this community to ensure that ""Preview in Firefox"" appears as a drop-down (it did not originally) and that it was selected.  (Steps involved getting a cleaned up version of mimeTypes.rdf and handlers.json.)  Still, when I click on a the link I was testing this with, it asks me ""What should Firefox do with this file?"" and if I manually select ""Open with...Other...Firefox,"" it will open in Firefox but still download to my PC.  Am I right that the user experience should always be that it automatically opens a new tab and displays the PDF there while NOT downloading to the user's PC?  That being said, I tested another random PDF and it did what it was supposed to.  I only tested these 2 after I did the fixes so I don't have a high sample size to say if it mostly works or mostly doesn't.  There was no discernible difference between the two files: both of their extensions were ""pdf,"" they both had kind of long filenames, and they both had ~100 pages in their files.

</p><p>As I realized some time ago, Firefox makes simulatneous requests againgst disk cache and network called ""Race Cache With Network"" (explained here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1267945)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1267945)</a>. In my home country, this has never bothered me as I had an unlimited data plan and therefore was pleased to get fast loading webpages.
</p><p>But now, I moved to a country without unlimited data plans (Ghana, 40GB per month, 120GHC, approx. 20€, approx. 22USD) and I'm thinking about how this feature must be eating up peoples data. Because even if you visited a webpage before and most of data is within your disk cache, Firefox will still issue a network request, resulting in increased network activity and therefore consuming additional data.
</p><p>In my opinion this adversely affects people in emerging countries, as internet is already a pricey good and Firefox is using more data than necessary, just to allow webpages to load fractions of seconds faster.
</p><p>Why is there no UI option (I know it can be turned off, using config key ""network.http.rcwn.enabled"") for users to turn this feature off more easily in order to save data? Furthermore, this behaviour is not even explained to users, so users might not even know Firefox consumes more data than expected.
</p><p>With best regards,
Gabriel

This is logical and obviously the most sane development route.

Every time Windows does an update my startup setting of 'restore previous session' gets cleared so that I start with a single home page.  Additionally, my default search engine gets changed to Bing.  Nothing else seems to get changed and everything works fine once I set the option back.
Interest8ingly the I see the same happen to Internet Explorer (which I keep for use on a small selection of sites)
Does anyone know how to stop these settings from getting reset all the time?

I have no idea which 5 sites had the same PW  (huh ?). I supposed over 20 years online and at 2500 logins, at some point my brain ran out of creative unique login's. I use a Password Program but it doesn't catch 3 email addresses that may share a common PW.   Any suggestions how to ""Resolve"" those breaches which I can barely remember where I've left my britches ?  Thanks.

After upgrading to v73 all files ( rar, zip.. ) that I used to save to a directory of my choice now default to open with ( eg winrar ). The dialog window still shows up with the ""open with / save file"" options, but before, once I picked ""save file"" it did remember the last choice and had ""save file"" choice set on concurrent downloads - now it does not, it defaults to ""open with"".
Now, when I un-register the eg. rar extension in Windows, and Firefox does not know what to open it with, it will remember the ""save file"" choice. As soon as I register the file type ( rar, 7z, zip.... ) it starts defaulting to ""open with"".
It becomes a pain and adds one more step to the file download to set ""save file""... It is also easy to just click ""open"" and instead of the download going to the desired directory, it opens it with the application it 'knows'. It is often far from the desired behavior, and it changed on 12FEB2020 when FF got updated to v73.
I have also removed and edited handlers.json - no luck

</p><p>Yesterday a top margin of the ""New tab"" page (""top sites"" etc. page) suddenly became missing (not centered vertically) in my Firefox 73.0. This page displays broken for any Firefox profile (for Firefox instances of other users of the same Windows), so resetting (""refreshing"") Firefox is not a solution, and most simple Firefox reinstallation also did not help.

There are also no any add-ons\extensions\plugins\themes in Firefox, and no Flash or Java installed.
</p><p>A similar question (№ 1268604) already exists here for a few months, but I decided to also begin a new thread for the issue, because the problem is quite sensitive for me - I do not want to reset entire PC to get rid of this tiny bug, even though I guess this would help a bit :)
</p><p>Can anybody clearly explain me, what and why has changed in my Firefox files yesterday and how can I fix this by any obvious tiny configuration actions or something alike? I still believe that a solution different from complex hardcore action exists for my case :'/

They do load on ALL other browsers however, I've always liked (past tense) Firefox and now it's driving me nuts.
They do NOT load on any Firefox browser on tablets, phone, laptop, desktop. But do load on any other browser. But they did before.
I have NOT changed anything other than Firefox updates. I do not have any extensions, add-ons.
All applies to one internet provider and since the pages load on any other browser besides Firefox, I assume the problem is Firefox.
I really liked Firefox until today. I'm at a loss, can anyone help with this, please?

</p><p>Today, I got a new drop-down from the address bar about Firefox blocking social media sites from tracking me.  I can't complain about that -- at least, not until some problem pops up for me as a result of it -- but it is obscuring the control to allow Flash to run, and by the time I got the new drop-down cleared the control did not allow Flash to run and I had to reload the page.
</p><p>However well-intentioned the developers are, I still maintain that they should -- until Flash officially deprecates at the end of the year -- allow a decision made by the user to allow Flash at a specific website to be saved by Firefox and eliminate the daily hassle of re-authorizing.  ESPECIALLY SINCE NOW THAT OTHER ENHANCEMENTS INTERFERE WITH THE FLASH ALLOWING DROP-DOWN.
</p><p>This is my ongoing request, which will be made on every new release this year until the developers understand that they are making the experience of using Firefox less user-friendly.  All because they just couldn't wait for the Flash deprecation to change how Firefox treats that plug-in.

I want it to autosave most passwords, and it had been doing that fine. Then I noticed saved passwords were being rejected by sites, and when I clicked on 'view' to see what the saved password was that had been autofilled, it wouldn't be right. It would be a different login and password for a previous site. For instance, firefox was trying to autofill my college login with my personal email and a different password, not my .edu email. I haven't changed any behavior or gone into settings or done anything that seems likely to trigger this issue. Also can't find anything about it in search. Any ideas?

A Forum I use extensively suddenly started showing content layed out in a sort of linear fashion where everything was set onto a new line.
I have used this forum for more than 18 years and this is the first time this has happened,
The site is a respected one, and a search for 'MSDN Forum' would provide a link(s) to my problem site.
After a LOT of work trying to find what has happened has resulted in my finding that scripts and CSS seem to be skipped from being loaded by Firefox reporting the error message I mention in the title. These errors are MANY thoughout the incoming data.
I subsequently tried to pursue Mozilla articles on Mixed Content Blocking, which seems to say Ishould have an option to 'disable' Firefox security with respect to the above via clicking on the 'sheild' icon and follow through to where there is supposed to be am option to 'stop/disble' - but there is no such option here so I can't check if that option is a cause of my issue.
This issue is very severe as it disable ALL of the needed buttons - such as Reply, Quote and Post New Question - for a Forum, that is indeed severe!
Now, I don't know if this whole issue is a fault with either Microsoft (who seem to be serving faulty data, or, Firefox for being overly coseting)
I attach an image showing a portion of the errors (they extend throughout the entire list).
Patricularly, the line at the top saying the Style Sheet could not be loaded summarizes the whole issue. Is there any other way I can get to disable Firefox being overly protective - I do know how to use the About:Config etc., but lack the ability to find anything relevant to this issue in any of the content there.
</p><p>A further snippet of information: amongst other things, I reinstalled Window 10 and used Edge immediately after install had completed - same issues (suggesting that either both browsers are overly protective, or that the issues stem from Microsoft). I have tried most/all of the things likely to be suggested here suxh as using Safe Mode, no Extensions etc.
</p><p>To save readers from becoming bored with this long essay, I'll stop here - if further info needed, just ask.

I was using ,y firefox account fine, but now after I log in you ask verification code which is sent to the old nonactive email.","<p>I was using firefox sync account wadahi@top<a href=""http://-mails.net"" rel=""nofollow"">-mails.net</a> just fine.  that email was deleted for non-use. No verification procedure was laid out anywhere in the agreement. Then firefox modified the agreement and now sends verification codes to that email, which I no longer have access to.
I am able to login in my account using the login and password , however firefox now wont allow me to change the email to the new one to receive verification code. 
I need access to my bookmarks and saved passwords NOW! Firefox had no rights to unilaterally change the agreement without notice to the customer. Firefox had no right to impose the verification email without letting the customer make sure his email can still recieve verification codes. Firefox failed to provide customer support because it doesnt even have a technical support email or phone number like a registered business should have.
I lost access to my bookmarks and saved passwords because of negligence and reckleness of Firefox in failing to notify the customer to change the email to make sure the email can receive incoming emails and is current. I have the access to my firefox sync account, however it wont let me login without the verification code which is being sent to a nonactive email, used many years ago.
</p><p>Suggested resolution: if you are a smart and relatively educated techncial support, you would realize that the same ip address would indicate that I am who I am and I should be allowed to change the email. However, firefox provided no technciall support and DID NOT EVEN HAVE A CONTACT EMAIL, while making significant profits from the customers and yet fails to provide technical support.

They are in a bulletin board so, while I started the pages, I do not control all the content on them. I need to scroll down to the bottom of each of these pages to see any new posts. When they load and all of the real content (the posts) have quickly downloaded, I try to scroll down. But the page constantly jumps back to the top over and over again and I must start scrolling anew. I assume this is due to remote content coming from other sites (ads). This wastes my time every day. I have tried reversing the order of the posts so the latest ones are on top, but there are problems with that also. I have also disabled the autoscroll Firefox feature, but this behavior still persists. The BB software does provide a means of getting links that point to places down the page and I am using them. But I still need to scroll to see what I need to see and small jumps back to the starting position are just as bad as larger ones to the top of the page. 
Is there any way of stopping this automatic scrolling after I have initiated even the slightest manual scroll of the page? If I, the viewer, scrolls the page, that means that I WANT IT in a different position. I don't want it to jump back to where IT wants to go.

Whenever I wanted to migrate my profile to a new Linux installation, all I had to do was copy the contents of the old Linux installation profile folder to the new Linux installation profile folder (No matter that they had different names).
Now I am trying to do it from Kubuntu 18.04 (Firefox 73.0 from PPA) to Kubuntu 20.04 (Firefox 73.0). I am doing what is explained in this guide:
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles</a>
</p><p>But after doing that when I start Firefox in Kubuntu 20.04, a message appears warning that my profile data may get corrupted and therefore to protect my data it gives me only two options, starting Firefox with a new empty profile or quit firefox. So I am not able to perform the migration.
How can I migrate my old profile in ofline mode? I don't want anything that requires having an account or uploading my data to some cloud thing (which I think what that Sync thing is). That is, I want to do the migration in offline mode, locally, on my machine.
Thank you.

</p><p>My problem is, I have a personal computer at home that I use myself, but I often leave my browser open (as it will only really be me using it.) so once I have put in my master password - anyone else who might use the browser could technically just go to a website, and use the auto fill feature.
</p><p>I ideally would like something that before firefox autofills the log in details that you stored, it should ask for the master password each time, just to confirm it is you - or at least make it a feature that you can toggle on and off so you can choose between this method and the traditional method like it is now. 
</p><p>I would like this because I dont necessarily want to lose the content in my browser every time I get up from my desk because Firefox will just allow anyone to use the autofill once the password is inserted.
</p><p>Unless this feature is already there - but I can seem to find it?
</p><p>Thanks again!

Via: 1.1 37.245.166.163
X-Forwarded-For: 37.245.166.163

</p><p>If I start a new firefox process (not tab), the ip used by those headers is different, I was using a proxy in Singapour and Mexico last 2 times.
</p><p>I try to disable all firefox extensions installed to see if it changes something. Nothing, the use of proxy was still there. And in Preferences -&gt; Networking Settings, the No proxy option is set.
</p><p>I asked friends with same firefox version, they do not have those request headers. Where does this behavior come from ? There is another way to set proxy in firefox ? Is my firefox hacked ? I try with chromium or some network command in console, and there is no request headers added.

</p><p>It happens to me since forever, on all OS, on many different devices, I learned to live with it, but I was bored and I was obliged to work on other browsers for a while where you don't experience things like that and at your return in Firefox it becomes big so I ended up posting it here
</p><p>It's maybe related to cache (not the cache that you flush with ctrl-F5, this isn't working but), a sort of cache related to Firefox process, the Web handler/content module maybe, I don't know. I guess that if maybe you can clean from the actual process all the data concerning the domain, it will load nicely without reloading all Firefox
</p><p>The step to reproduce are quite difficult as you see here but i'm sure that i'm not the only one experiencing that

Until recently, I could open Gmail and see my main email account and I could go to YouTube and automatically be login with my YouTube Gmail account.
I refreshed Firefox and now when I open YouTube it asks me to sign in, when I do it changes my login in Gmail, so I have to re-login to Gmail to my main email account. When I re-login to Gmail, it signs me out of YouTube into the other Gmail account! It goes back and forth wasting time.
I would be grateful to fix this to save the wasted time it takes to keep having to login back and forth. I've been searching for an answer and haven't found a good solution yet. All I've found are frustrated people in various threads.
My Android phone is able to keep my Gmail account logged in and my other Gmail account logged into Youtube but, on my mac computer on Firefox it no longer keeps them separate. It seems to have happened after I refreshed Firefox recently.
</p><p>I look forward to hearing if there is a solution. Thank you.

I was reading more about this setting after I feel like 'youtube is so slow, but what if I turn this off, will this make any difference?' and yes it did! So it was a good idea, and I would like to share this.
On devices with integrated graphics only - this setting should be disabled by default for new firefox installations. I really noticed a significant difference on my notebook when turning this off, but on my game-desktop with GPU GeForce 1050ti i don't notice difference because the GPU is good enough.

It doesnt work for new sites or sites that redirect to you a slightly different subdomain and it is F-ing annoying. I posted this almost a year and though the question has been closed, it hasnt been fixed. So attempt #2.
</p><p>Original post (which is now 10 months old):
Firefox has changed the way its URL auto fill works a while ago. (At least-3 months ago; I remember stumbling on a reddit post from Sep 16th saying that it should be fixed with v63, which is why I waited to try it out.) It seems to be mostly with redirects, see examples below, but also with new sites: it seems to only auto complete after you visited a new site at least twice. I'm a fairly advanced user, so I'm quite convinced I've checked all possible solutions, like check settings in about:config, do a clean install, etc. Also, this behaviour has changed on both my computers and my new work pc.
</p><p>I'm fairly certain it used to work like it still does in Pale Moon, which is my preferred method Examples: 1. If you go to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a> you're forwarded to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>. If you now close the tab and type 'ste' PM autofills it to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a>, Fx does not. It does suggest the page, but does not auto complete it (it does, however, autofill 'sto' to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>).
</p><p>2. The same thing happens for <a href=""http://chrome.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chrome.google.com</a>, which redirects to <a href=""http://google.com/chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com/chrome</a>
</p><p>3. <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a> forwards to <a href=""http://ikea.com/nl/nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com/nl/nl/</a>. PM autofills 'ik' to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>, Fx, again, does not. It _does_ auto fill to <a href=""http://ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com</a>, which is doubly annoying, because now you have to click 'to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>' every time.
</p><p>So, is this change by design? Can and will it be fixed/reverted?

Is there some way to get the normal behaviour? Some setting I'm not seeing or about:config entry? In other menus in Firefox and Thunderbird, like context menus or menubar menus, behaviour is normal - hovering over a sub-menu causes it to appear: it's just the hamburger menu where it doesn't and the user has to click.

</p><p>Firefox is blocking images in my Gmail (Screenshot 1). Red is where images usually are.

I have white listed Gmail from Enhanced Content Blocking but it still will not stop blocking those images. I have:
</p><p>- cleared cache
- updated firefox to newest version
- uninstalled and reinstalled
- restarted computer
- refreshed firefox
- turned off uBlock Origin and all other add-ons
- tried in private mode

This allowed users to make custom engines the DEFAULT search engine. (Engines can be added to Bookmarks but then they require a keyword to activate. Default engines do not require a keyword to activate).
</p><p>The way to do it was:
1) place a folder called ""searchplugins"" with your custom .xml file describing your search engine (i.e.,, a URL with a %s added to it) inside your Home folder on a Linux OS.
</p><p>2) open the Web Console
</p><p>3) input:
Services.search.addEngine(""file:///home/user/searchplugins/custom-engine.xml"", null, null, false);
</p><p>4) now your custom search engine would appear in the search engine listing in Firefox and could be made default
</p><p>On recent Firefoxes, this no longer works. When I inter the Sevices.search.addEngine part to the Web Console, I get this message: ""ReferenceError: Services is not define""
</p><p>I've been using Google Chrome because of stuff like this. Firefox just doesn't allow me to do what I want to do. But I appreciate Mozilla ideals and am trying to give Firefox another chance. But it is contingent on being able to make my custom search engine the default search engine.
</p><p>Is there a fix for this error I'm encountering in the Web Console?

When the symptoms occurred once more, I analyzed connection with ping  <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> -t (image attached). It shows that wifi connection is practically cut off for 2,5 seconds every few seconds which makes wifi connection almost unusable.
</p><p>I then analyzed situation further and noticed that connection returns to normal when Firefox is closed. Ping is again firmly between 10-12 seconds. After some further study, I found out that this problem starts every time I allow sharing my location on some web page on Firefox. It can be easily reproduced and it happens each time. Closing the tab where I share my location does not fix the issue, but closing Firefox always does.
</p><p>Connection problems do not occur when I use ethernet connection, only on wifi.
</p><p>I am not able to produce this issue by sharing location on Edge or Chrome, nor on some Windows app which uses location services.
</p><p>I started Firefox on safe mode but it did not make any difference, wifi got broken after I shared my location on some tab.
</p><p>Interestingly, I was able to produce the same problem also on Firefox on another laptop which has Windows 7. There the max ping time is around 1500 ms every few seconds after location is shared. Location sharing on Chrome does not produce the problem there either.
</p><p>I tried to google about the issue but I couldn't find practically anything.

I have all scale options selected. Try to print A4, if I under layout change from ""Recommended: A4"" to ""A4"" or the other way it prints. Then I can print however much I want until I print a label.

NOT the password, just the user name and address ...","<p>I am not even sure how in the world to explain what info I need. Please be patient, because I don't want a bunch of answers that don't answer this very important question to me:
when you type in your email, or user name, which ever is required to log into a website, how it is that the user name is remembered? Which part of the browser is recalling the user name and how do you stop it?
I never ever allow browsers to remember/retain passwords.
Now, I am having real concern about the part of the browser that recalls user name and whatever else.
I went to log into a site, Amazon, and I usually don't even have to type the full email when my full email appears. It is a common thing for all of us.
But I see a half dozen of my other emails and possible user names -- as though someone was trying to log in and used a name that I would never use. It was abusive, too.
I have a strong feeling, too, that this mozilla site, some people in this site,  do not honor people's privacy. I cannot see how in the world anyone could create something like that otherwise. 
You would have to have access to an individual's browser in their notebook, and use it to try to log into sites, there were a few of them, using various user names. 
How can one do that? Well some of those people who lurk around here pretending to help, but don't have enough to do and don't know what being professional means. Anyone here who would dare violate anyone's privacy can be charged with a crime. that is theft and worse.
To use someone's browser to try to log into sites like Amazon. 
To be guessing at user names, and making some up.
I never use anything but what I actually use, so to see my emails and usernames, PLUS made up names that someone thinks they might use, or someone here thinks oh this woujld be funny, is the worst kind of business that will get mozilla right off the map here. 
Please how do I get in touch with the creators of this? I can take a screen shot. 
I have done that before. No browser recalls any thing unless it is has been used and is stored. That is how the user name is recalled, but how could that happen if I never used that specific name? Who could have done that?
Please if I need to explain better, ask. This is very important. 
Very important.

I am using Firefox since 14 years, and all the time it has been my favourite Internet Browser and I advised every friend of mine to choose this internet browser. But I am afraid it's gonna change soon. 
I lost my laptop, it was stolen. 
I store my history from a couple of years, bookmarks, saved passwords. 
I had a backup by MozBackup on May 2019. 
On December I copied a profile as it was written in your guides: (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles</a>) 
I copied everything from:
%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\
I hadn't investigate what is inside. And after i bought a new laptop I had many problems with Firefox, can someone explain me please: 
1. I couldn't login to Sync, due i hadn't remembered my password - ok its my fault, but when i wanted to reset i would lose all my data?! Why is that? I can understand due to its encrypted but... Luckly after some combination i recovered my password. 
2. So i copied my profile as it was written in your guide, and i hadn't investigate what is inside. Now when i tried to copy my whole profile its not working, why? Well, i checked and there were no file: places.sqlite . I have no clue why, so my backup from December is lost. 
3. You informed people about Syncing, why there is nowhere information that you syncing history, yes, but only 2 months??!! You claim that we will have bookmarks, saved passwords, cache and history yes thats true, but history for only 8 weeks..... I understand that it has many bytes to store, but it should be somewhere information about it!
If i would knew that i would be more prepared for lost, and did more often proper backup by MozBackup. 
I feel now very frustrated about this situation, and first time after 14 years I'm very, very disappointed with Firefox.
Can someone explain me please, why is that? 
Thank you for reply!
Kind regards

5) I didn't have any active plug-in (only OpenH264 codec is listed and is disabled), I have no extensions installed, privacy policy set to strict, private browsing mode, all permissions disabled, checked ""prevent accessibility services from accessing your brower"", blocked ""Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection"" and certificates set to ""Ask you every time""
6) ""Connection settinges"" set to ""No proxy""
7) NO active policy listed in ""about:policies"" (""about:policies#active"" is empty) and NO ""Your browser is being managed by your organization"" message is shown

I was expecting that, at most, Firefox will not be able to surf the web if no direct HTTPS connection is allowed by Avast.
Why does Firefox allow a MITM connection (even if Avast certificate has been deleted, even if there isn't any active policy listed in ""about:policies#active"") and I'm not able to avoid this behavior?
</p><p>Moreover, once I restart the PC, security.enterprise_roots.enabled is forced to True (locked), ""Avast Web/Mail Shield Root"" reinstalled inside ""Certificate Manager"" and ""Your browser is being managed by your organization"" message is back.
</p><p>Why can't the user have full control on Firefox? In my opinion, this is a critical security issue. I mean, how could an external software so easily take full control of Firefox? Additionally, using this approach a MITM attack can be done quite easily from an organization having an active certificate and without the user even knowing it (I repeat, ""about:policies#active"" was empty).

</p><p>To run reports I need them to run in a separate window so I use;

This works swimmingly in all browsers (IE, Chrome &amp; Edge) except Firefox (FF). The app has been around for quite a while, and I can't imagine that it never worked in FF, but it doesn't with the last couple of releases.
</p><p>The symptom is that the .NET ""Current.Session.SessionID"" changes to a new ID for both the original browser window as well as the new browser window. This causes it to lose all session variables, of course.
</p><p>The problem only seems to manifest itself if I use ""POST"" to send variables to the popup window. If I use ""GET"" everything works fine. An added ""bonus"" is the ""Post"" parameters being sent to the new window disappear. So my report doesn't run, and the original window ""loses its mind since the session ID changes.""

Occasionally, I would prefer to open PDFs in the browser. However, if I select Firefox instead of Acrobat Reader from the dialog box, I get the same dialog again, because Firefox--rightly--interprets this as another request to open a PDF and since my preferences are ""Always ask,"" that's what it does. I would like to be able to tell it not to ask in this one instance, while retaining my preference generally. I don't see a way to do this.
</p><p>There are a couple of possible workarounds, none of which is entirely satisfactory. I could set my preferences to Preview in Firefox, and then if I prefer to open in Acrobat right-click, select Save As, and then open the local file. This is less than ideal because it adds a few steps and reverses my order of preference (most of the time I want to be asked so I can either open in Acrobat or save the file). 
</p><p>I could change my preferences on those rare occasions when I want to preview the file in Firefox but, again, this adds steps. 
</p><p>I could set the preferences to open the file in the browser and then click the download option. This might be the shortest workaround--just adds one step--but it is still an extra step and, again, reverses my preferred order. 
</p><p>I suspect there's no solution to this because it requires Firefox to be able to distinguish between a general preference and a specific preference, and that would(?) require extensive additional coding. But I figured I'd ask in case I'm overlooking something. Lacking that, if anyone has a more elegant workaround than the ones I've described, I'm open to suggestions!

You can see from the 1st attached image that the sync engine thought there was a different user being signed in and I did get a ""New Sign-in to firefox"" email.  That could be because of my vpn, but the accounts sign in when creating the new account was with the same vpn generated ip as with the sync sign in, so I don't know what's going on there.
</p><p>(2) SYNC ERRORS:  Looking at the 2nd attached image you can see there were unknown problems with the extension-storage engine.  While I did not include the complete log file, there did not appear to be any problems with the other engines.  In the end syncing failed and the server was flushed.

Prior to this, every week I would load a page containing a one or two-sided weekly bulletin, that would fit conveniently on a sheet of A4 paper. Then I would then tweak the scaling to get the best possible fit of the items before printing. But now every time I try this, whether on my desktop or laptop, it comes out with strange font sizes that appear to require substantially more or less scaling to get a fit. With enough tweaking, I can get the preview looking OK: but then, when printed, the actual layout is completely different! It looks as if the paper sizing information has been corrupted somehow: but I have already tried resetting the 'Firefox printer setting', then 'all Firefox printer settings;' and finally a complete deinstall and reinstall. But none of these have cured the problem. I have been assured that the page I have been attempting to print has not been altered recently: and in any case the problem appears not to be limited to that one page. This preview and scaling feature has been one of the great plus features of Firefox for me. I don't know any other browser that normally does this so well: but now I'm desperately looking for any workable solution. Any ideas or suggestions?

To save electricity I often turn off my computer and leave tabs open to deal with them later (sometimes too much later, but anyway).
When I did the Firefox refresh the browser told me not to worry I will find out my tabs again.
After the refresh, they were there.
But then I closed Firefox and once I launched it again, they were gone.
Because that setting was reinitialized: ""Restaurer la session précédente"" (FR, means ""restore previous session"")
I cannot find them back in the history, because only those that I opened are in the history. This I did not open were not loaded by FF and therefore do not appear in the history.
</p><p>My suggestion would be:
- either to have this setting always enabled by default
OR
- during the reset, if this setting was checked, to keep it or ask the user if they want to keep it, warning it can be a source of slowness

</p><p>This doesn't become an issue until the cached security certificate expires, then the user faces the ""this website is not secure"" warning page. The user tries to reload the page multiple times and continues to get the same warning page, then they call me in a panic and say ""my website is not loading because it is not secure!""
</p><p>The solution is Ctrl+F5 and voila the website loads without issue.
</p><p>However, this is definitely an ""issue"" and the issue isn't with the website or the lack of knowledge of the end user. End users should not need to know how to refresh their local cache of a website to resolve a security certificate expiring when it has already been renewed. Firefox should by default check for a new security certificate when the cached version has expired or at least that is what would appear to be the logical progression of local caching.
</p><p>Unfortunately, I have been unable to find a way to report this issue to Firefox developers...so I am reporting it here in hopes that someone in the community has the ear of the development team and can point out this issue.

I'm trying to use the ""Update to 73.0 Beta 11"" button from the ""About"" screen to update the browser.

</p><p>I'm going to submit a request to our enterprise idiot to have this fixed in their whitelists, etc. but before I can do that, I need to know what kinds of permissions to request. What's responsible for the update process and what folders need to have which permissions for this to work?
</p><p>Because right now, pressing the ""Update to 73.0 Beta 11"" button results in Firefox downloading the update but when it tries to install it, it fails with the ""Update failed. Download the latest version"" message in the ""About"" screen (when it was working last week without a single hitch).
</p><p>According to my about:support details, I'm seeing the following:
</p><p>- Update Folder: C:\ProgramData\Mozilla\updates\&lt;Long String&gt;
- Application Binary: C:\Program Files\Firefox Developer Edition\firefox.exe
- Profile Folder:  C:\Users\&lt;my username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&lt;string&gt;.dev-edition-default
- Antivirus, Antispyware, and Firewall are all governed by McAfee Endpoint Security (which hasn't been an issue in the past).
</p><p>I suspect that all of this is due to our enterprise guys modifying the permissions that our ""elevated permissions"" has... So once I have a better understanding of what things need which permissions, I'll be able to request that the elevated permissions be modified accordingly.
</p><p>Any insight into this would be appreciated. It's a shame we don't have logs that clearly explain what folders or files lack whatever permissions to better understand bottlenecks like this. Maybe we do have that and I'm just not aware of it?

5) Refresh page (use F5 or the circle-arrow) (Search bar still says 2 matches)

I have experienced many times whenever I intend to do a two finger scroll, the browser interprets it as adjusting zoom(which is via two finger pinch). It can't be the issue of my touchpad device / driver issue because pinch zoom and two finger scroll has worked perfectly on other browsers and apps. I haven't encountered a single case where an app interpreted my two finger scroll as a zoom action since the moment i bought this laptop. I believe it has something to do with firefox.

In fact I kind of know it's Win 10 because pretty much the same thing happens on Edge and Chrome :)
Anyway,in Win 7 when you right click and select 'save as' [eg for a picture on Twitter] it saves the file literally instantly...but on Win 10 there's a slight delay,of say a few seconds,before it goes ahead and saves the file. I've tried tons of things that people suggest for this issue,like disabling every service that isn't absolutely necessary etc,disabling some of them fixes it for a short while,then the same thing starts again. Tried a couple of different anti-virus programs [I usually use Avast,I tried Panda and Bitdefender],it did seem a tiny bit better for a while with Panda...but only for a while. I tried several other things I saw in different forums,that I can't remember,none of which fixed it. So I reinstalled Win 7 on that machine...100% perfect,instant 'save as' function,just as it always was before [this lasted for whole 3 days I had Win 7 on there]
</p><pre>I thought,well maybe it's that this old pc doesn't like Windows 10 or something,so since the pc was getting pretty old anyway I then bought a brand new 9th Gen i7 pc with 16GB RAM,installed Win 10 and it's exactly the same.
</pre>
<p>This problem does seem to go away if I reboot...but then it comes back an hour later...or 5 minutes later :)
Does anyone have any idea at all what I can do to fix this? Or is this just normal for Win 10? 
It's only a fairly small delay,not the 20-30 second delay some others are reporting,it's not the end of the world I suppose,but it's just really annoying,for instance if you're downloading a whole bunch of pics or something it's almost unusable.

A sort of greyish overlay appears over the background that is present before the mouse crosses into the tab.  The selected tab does not change color; all the others do.  This is really distracting to me; I never noticed it before.  How do I get it to stop?  (userchrome methods are fine.)

</p><p>After initially opening Firefox:
When trying to access a regular website such as <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, either by entering a url in the address bar, or clicking on one of the bookmarks, Firefox gives absolutely no response.
When trying to click on the menu items such as Add-ons or Options that open a configuration page, or typing in the address bar about:(whatever), I get no response at all too.
The only exception is when I click the Help-&gt;Troubleshooting Information item in the menu.  This one alone loads the page in a new tab normally.
</p><p>And in the same tab that the Troubleshooting Information loaded, I am able to load other configuration pages by typing about:(whatever) in the address bar.  Opening a new tab to type in about:(whatever), however, will result in Firefox giving no response just like before.
Also at this point, menu items like Add-ons and Options that before had been returning no response when clicked, will now open up new tabs that load the list of add-ons or the various configuration options like normal.
When it comes to regular webpages, however, after I click on Help-&gt;Troubleshooting Information and enter a website url into the address bar of that same tab, Firefox will show the spinning wheel, but will never load the webpage.
</p><p>In addition, when I exit Firefox, where before updating it only took seconds, now it will take minutes before the firefox.exe process closes.
</p><p>All of the symptoms described above DO NOT occur when I boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.  Firefox will run normally and properly load all kinds of configuration tabs and webpages using my regular old profile.
</p><p>I had tried many of the other suggestions on the support site, such as creating a new profile, refreshing Firefox, reinstalling Firefox, downgrading Firefox to 50s &amp; 60s versions, reallowing Firefox on my firewall software, and even uninstalling my firewall/antivirus software, yet none of them had helped.  I am still able to have Firefox properly run in Windows 7 Safe Mode but go haywire in Windows 7 Normal Mode.
</p><p>If anybody has any idea what is going on, then any help is appreciated.  Thank you.

</p><p>The problem: Only a select few of my addons work after installing a parallel (older) version of firefox in a separate Program Files folder I called ""Firefox 49.02. (why I wanted to do that: there is a specific iMacros version and some scripts that only work with 49.02, and I wanted to use FF 49.02 to run that version of iMacros while I wasn't using the regular updated version (i.e. FF 72).
</p><p>I didn't expect my current addons to work in FF 49, so I wasn't surprised when they were disabled for that version.
</p><p>BUT when opening the latest, FF 72, virtually all my addons were also disabled!
</p><p>All disabled addons, except for 3 of them (out of almost 100), don't even have a blue switch or a way to enable them, even in the context menu, or the manage page (where you can enable auto-updates and see author details and home page etc.). 
</p><p>I ran a ""Check for updates"" for all addons, and a couple managed to update and enable, though I'm not sure if they were ones that had a switch. 
</p><p>I've attached a screenshot of the addons page showing some without an enable option beside a couple that do. 
</p><p>Note: All these addons worked flawlessly in this prior to installing FF 49
</p><p>I've searched everywhere but everything is so saturated with fixing the ""disabled addons certificate"" problems that happened for everyone who *upgraded*. In my case, I installed a parallel downgraded version and the addon's won't work in either version. 
</p><p>Hope things are clear, sorry if I repeated my self. Please let me know any more information needed I am desperately seeking a solution for this.

Checked what had been running on my Laptop, to see what might have been doing this, and the ONLY thing I could find that had run in the interveing period was Firefox Sync.
</p><p>Modified my Firefox Sync settings so that NOTHING now gets syned, and then re-added the bookmark folder and the new bookmark. 3 days later it's still there, so obviously Firefox Sync was the cause.

Close the program"". I do not click the link to close the program I click the ""X"" at the top right of the popup window. That will initiate a reload of the page. But, the page loads with none of the graphics loading. If I click the refresh button myself my page will load just fine. The only reason I even did an upgrade was because it would not let me load ANY page and kept saying my flash player was out of date and had to be updated.  I did update flash but Firefox would still not work. A couple months ago I tried to do an upgrade which crashed. I ended up doing an uninstall and installed the latest version. I lost everything including my profile. After much searching for answers using Google Chrome I finally found out how to retrieve a copy of my old profile and help on how to install it. I did an upgrade this week which I had to do from Google Chrome but at least it worked and I didn't have to lose anything. But, then it would not use flash so I had to again use Google Chrome to get flash to download and install the correct update. You know... all that NPAPI and NPAPI crap because Firefox uses a different version of flash player than Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. I  am currently using version 72.0.2 of Firefox. I had installed an update for Flash player before updating Firefox. I had to reinstall the version of Flash that I had just installed. I am now running version 32.0.0.321. Firefox still stops working and I still have to jump through the hoops of reloading it. I am NOT going to update my Windows 7 Home because I do not want Windows 10. If I try to update my graphics card MS will force me to upgrade Windows. They stopped supporting Windows 7. The only good thing is that now it does not open the library item on boot that even after following instructions to turn off kept loading anyway. All that installing and reinstalling eats up a lot of my metered data allowance so the next time I will probably just uninstall Firefox. I forgot to say that NO I DO NOT OWN A SMART PHONE AND DO NOT PLAN ON GETTING ONE. MY DESKTOP PC WORKS JUST FINE. I DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD AN APP EVERY TIME I WANT TO DO ANYTHING. If using computers for the past 40 years has taught me anything it is all about putting money in someone's pocket and making it easier for thieves to destroy my life. I am sorry that the youth of today are stupid and want things to be easy and do not realize the expense to their very existence.  I do not want you to fix anything. I apologize for my attitude. I just needed to vent.

</p><p>I'm almost sure this only happens with vp9 and so far I've only seen it happen in 1080p and over (1080p60 etc).
</p><p>The gpu should be more than able to play these. And in the moments it isn't spiking it's only using like 30 to 40% so it is more than able.
</p><p>Edit 1: It's really strange because I just watched 4k60 videos and 1080p60 videos in both VP9 and AV and they worked just perfect and then I went to a 1080p24 in VP9 and it skips like hell. And then I went back to the previous video and it gets almost 100% skipped frames at 4k60 when just 5 minutes ago it was playing it fine.
</p><p>So basically I can't successfully reproduce the problem the same way all the time. Maybe you guys have some tools I can use to do more in-depth testing.
</p><p>Edit 2: I am now convinced that the problem lies with the iGPU not having enough memory because one common thing that I noticed every time there's skipping is that the vram is pretty much full.
At the same time that's strange because the system should then use the system memory as shared memory, right?

</p><p>Unless you have another idea of how to get my old FF back!  yes I made a backup of my old profile.

Even with only 1 process.,"<p>After 72.0.2 I started to notice performance problems with my firefox. Symptoms are similiar to my multiprocess problems I had after it was added. I managed to avoid it for some time by limiting processes number to 1 (which was 4 in reality)
</p><p>Long story short: when you open new tab firefox has to create new process which is somewhat correlated to your PC performance (however it hangs up even on 4800MHz i5 with nvme pci-e 3.0 x4 ssd so....). When this process is already created and you enter different website it is smooth - firefox does not have to create another process until you open NEW TAB or it reaches its limit (from 1 to 8 processes/tabs) - set via settings. 
If limit was set to more than 1 I had problems with hanging up for few seconds until I reached limit - so if it was set to 4 I opened 1 tab and 3 links I clicked (with new tabs) slowed firefox down for me, but 4th, 5th etc. were fine. So I set it to 1 permanently and problem disappeared - every tab opened as fast as before.
</p><p>But now problem seems to have returned. I still have 1 in my settings but symptoms are pretty much the same (but there are only 4 processes). However browser is not hanging up - it seems like connection is. It does nothing - ""waiting for xxxxxx"" in lower left corner and then after 1-2s page actually starts to load. It is present on every website I visit, no matter how many tabs or windows I open.
</p><p>So my question is - what did you break in this firefox version? Previously it was youtube, now it is all sites...

Running Firefox in safe mode didn't fix the issue
I'm on a laptop if it is any help.

Now, after the update, when I attempt to go into my Quickbooks Online account and create a 'new' estimate or invoice, the menus work, but after clicking, nothing opens. I'm not very familiar with web design, but I believe they are Java based menus. If I click one of the links that directs to an outside website, they work fine.
I've noticed the same thing on other websites, gemlux marine boat parts is another. Same thing, clicking in a menu does not open the link.
</p><p>Lastly, when shopping on Amazon, if an item has an option (like sizes, colors, etc), and I click on the different size or color, it does not update the item page and price like it normally does. In other words, if I have a $20 item in size SMALL, and hit the drop down to change it to a size LARGE which should be $10 more, the price change does not show in Amazon's price menu. I found that if I click the 'large' in the drop down, leave it, and refresh the page, the page loads with the 'large' size selected, and then prices it correctly. 
</p><p>For whatever reason, if I switch to 'privacy' mode, it works fine.
</p><p>I have used all of these websites frequently in the past year, and only in the last week has this started occurring. 
All of these websites work just fine in Chrome, IE, Edge, etc.

Because I have quite a few logins saved this can result in getting a dropdown of dozens of 'suggested' logins and finding the one in the list that's the actual login for the site I'm visiting is a bit of pain. How can I set this so that Firefox will only show me logins for the site I'm currently visiting the way it used to?

So, what is happening as you can see in the screenshot I shared that Firefox is using a rather flamboyant font I'm not familiar with actually.  This seems to happen exclusively within text-boxes on forums where you have control over the font used.  This text box, for instance, does not have the effect.
</p><pre>    I have had this happen on a few sites now, and have nailed it down specifically at this point.  It's always a text box, and only those which allow you to change the font characteristics and style.  Without the ability to change font, it uses the fonts from my settings.  Yet, weirdly any time that I get a text box with options?  Same garish font rears its ugly head!  lol.

</p><p>I want Firefox to delete all data, which means cookies and site data, when I close all Firefox's windows. But since I migrated to win10, I've been experiencing a trouble.
</p><p>Back in my win7 environment, things were working as intended. 
I went to ""about:preferences#privacy"". Then on ""Cookies and Site Data"" section, I ticked ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed."" And on ""History"" section, I chose ""Firefox will Use custom settings for history"". And I ticked ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". Also I ticked all boxes on ""Settings for Clearing History"" window.
All data seemed deleted when I closed Firefox back then.
</p><p>But things were changed in a weird way. 
The settings on ""History"" section is working but I've noticed some leftovers. All cookies are gone and you're logged out, but I noticed that some sites STILL have some settings. A example is ""<a href=""http://tenki.jp"" rel=""nofollow"">tenki.jp</a>"", which is a weather forecast page. I opened a page of a location, and close Firefox, and start Firefox, and went to the top page, but it still remembers the location which I checked earlier.
The setting on ""Coolies and Site Data"" section is worse. It works, but not in the intended way. I opened a page of a location on the weather forecast site, and went to the top page, it of-course remembered the location. But I opened the top page on ANOTHER TAB, it forgets the location. It seems like Firefox shares cookies and log-in information between tabs, but don't shares this sort of data when the setting is ticked.
</p><p>I don't understand what is going on. All I know is that some sites uses ""that sort of data"", which is not cookies and site data apparently, to store site settings, and Firefox can't handle them well.
</p><p>If you know a solution, please let me know.

In doing so, I am having trouble having firefox use the current user profile in 60.7 and having firefox 72.0.1 defaulting to that same profile upon initial launch after installation. Instead, the new firefox creates a new profile and uses that instead of using the old profile. So my question is: is there a way to force firefox to use the old profile prior to installing FF 72? If not, is there a way to suppress the creation of a new profile so it is never created in the first place?

I use Whatsapp.web to chat when on my PC. I have no trouble connecting to Whatsapp.web using my Iphone and Firefox. However, EVERY time that FF closes, for a restart, or simply when I make a mistake and accidentally close the browser, the connection to Whatsapp.web is apparently broken. I say apparently because on the Iphone, it sontinues to list Windows 10 as an active device using the web app. When I used Microsoft Edge, once I scanned the QR code and connected, I would STAY connected, even overnight after I had shut down the PC. I am wondering if there are certain privacy or security settings which are preventing Whatsapp from staying connected when the FF browser closes. I also remember that a couple of years ago, when I was using FF in the 40s versions, maybe, Whatsapp also stayed connected. Just a note: the reason this is sort of a problem for me is that I am blind, and I use certain visual accessibility settings on Windows and FF that do not allow the Whatsapp QR to be scanned; so I have to change the entirevisual setting of my PC, scan the code, then restore the entire visual setting. Any ideas how to keep Whatsapp.web connected always, or at least as long as I don't end my Windows session?

' appeared before the progrom loaded.  I've seen this before and it has always continued to load Firefox.
This time, after some hard-drive activity, the program did not load.
I started looking for support and chose to uninstal v72 - shut down my laptop and restarted it.
I downloaded the latest version and at the end of install - where 'run firefox' is expected - nothing happened.
I have since uninstalled and downloaded the latest beta version (73) - and now, when I ask to run the program, it opens a window but all the tabs are 'dead' and no matter what I type, the program does not connect to the internet (i.e. Google search or direct to a known web address).
If I select settings, I can see the drop-down list - but if I select 'Add-ons' (for example) - nothing happens.
I attempted to run my laptop in safe mode, but I have no recall of the password needed to get past the login screen.
Is there anything simple I can do to bring my Firefox back to life?

Long ago, I enabled ""Show tab previews in the Windows taskbar"" in Options and until a week or two ago, whenever I hovered over the Firefox icon in the taskbar, a small image of the web page in each tab would appear above the taskbar. If I hovered over an image, it would then become full screen and readable. Now, hovering over the image produces a blank, greyed out screen with a rotating blue circle that eventually becomes a tiny image.
This happens on all tabs except the tab for Firefox Options. This tab operates normally and will appear normal when hovered over.

I am not sure what happened, I have been using FF for a long time with no problems. Everytime I load up firefox, it has erased my tabs and I have no history.
Upon uninstalling it and reinstalling for some reason the ""history"" comes back, but after the next shutdown and restart, it's all gone again.
I am unsure as to why.
Also when I log into my FF account, my computer I use while working doesn't sync to this one either.
I am confused more by the tabs not reopening and history disappearing than the sync.
Under options I already have it ticked to remember my tabs.
All Plugins are uninstalled now and still doesn't fix it
Any help would be appreciated.

There are many sites where you actually want pop ups (bank statements, downloads, etc.)  On my other computers with Firefox, ublock shows a bar at the top of the browser and gives me the option to say- No pop up, allow once only, or always allow for this site. I didn't have to change any settings to have this happen. However, on this newly downloaded version it doesn't do that and it's very frustrating and cumbersome to use. Basically, I have to know that the site wants to pop up a new screen, turn off ublock, and then remember to turn it back on. I have looked all through the ublock and firefox settings to figure out how to do this and can't see where to make this bar show. Very frustrating! Any tips for fixing this?  Or, other, better pop up blockers to use?

As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser. Strangely, safe mode removes the issue, but again, not sure why. I did check another browser— Namely Waterfox Classic. That worked fine. And so far the only suggestion anyone has had from the tech service that I have on the machine has made that makes sense is that this might be a video driver issue. I did just recently update my drivers, this is true. However the issue did not start up until a few days after this had occurred. I tried reinstalling the driver to see if that would fix the issue.  The issue itself is very weird. It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop. 
</p><p>Again, Waterfox does not seem to have this issue. At first it was suggested to me on another thread that the issue might be because Waterfox Classic doesn't use hardware acceleration, so I turned that off on Firefox. Which does allow things to play more or less okay, though at times when I scroll, it seems to mess with the screen in a similar fashion to the initial playback issues, and again, it's not consistent with that, just like it's not consistent with the video playback when the browser's Hardware acceleration is on.
</p><p>However, I just learned that Waterfox Classic /does/ use hardware acceleration, though it seems to have a much lower content limit set by default. This makes me think that whatever is going on may be a glitch in Firefox itself that may have somehow come up. Though how and why I have no earthly clue, as prior to last Monday there was no issue, as I said earlier. More unusually sometimes the effect vanishes on videos where it's shown up. 
</p><p>I have tried to screenhot this and it /never/ appears in screenshots, and doesn't show up when paused either. I've even tried to take a picture of it with my phone or record it with said. Also no luck. I /have/ however, been able to find a video that does this affect deliberately, so I can at least present it here. Again, this is not consistent, seems to move around the screen, and only seems to occur on those three video sites as I stated. Apparently whatever the issue is, it's /NOT/ something to do with the hardware acceleration, as I learned, again, that WaterfoxClassic /does/ use it and it is active in that browser, and was active when I first tried it, so that narrows it down to some kind of glitch either with Firefox or Windows and how it interacts with either the former or the latter, depending on where the glitch is coming from. 
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's causing this?
</p><p>The image attached is an example of what I'm seeing, however, bear in mind that this video is /deliberately/ showing this effect in an attempt to replicate the type of thing one might see on old video tapes being played after years of disuse, but it /is/ the same general appearance, more or less, of what I occasionally see on Firefox when using the videos on the above mentioned sites.

When I use the Browser Toolbox to examine the layout, it seems that the TabsToolbar object is now a child of a container that includes that and the Menu Bar. Adjusting the CSS allows me to change the order of those two, but I can't get the tabs to move below the bookmarks toolbar, where they belong. Can anyone point me to an article that will help me move the tabs to the right location?

</p><p>When watching Netflix in Mozilla Firefox (72.0.1 (64-bit)), the video quality is noticeably lower than when watching in Microsoft Edge (44.18362.449.0) or Google Chrome (79.0.3945.130) and does not improve, even after setting my account to use the highest video quality setting (High) and watching the video for upwards of thirty minutes. I have the Premium Ultra HD subscription.
</p><p>For reference, I am running a computer with Windows 10 Pro 64 bit (version 1909), I have hardware acceleration enabled in Firefox, my content process limit is set to eight, and my computer has a dedicated AMD Radeon RX 470 dedicated GPU, running the latest stable driver version, 19.12.2.

Stangely, it also says this is the case for Google Chrome on Windows 10, but Netflix playback on Chrome appears noticeably clearer to me. Edge is clearer still, though that support page says that browser supports up to 4K playback.

It just won't go away !  Have tried all the blocking options -- ""Block similar elements"" etc, but zero luck.  The frames appear to use unique identifiers that are different for every page load.  On other sites I have defeated similar strategies by ""Block similar elements"", but not on The Federalist Papers.  I think it is important we solve this before other sites catch onto it.  Ideas ?

En la versión 70.0.1 al iniciar sesión se sincronizaba el historial, marcadores y varios datos más, al salir o cerrar sesión todo, completamente todo se eliminaba, es decir, me dejaba el navegador limpio, como si no lo hubiera usado, eso para mí es muy importante debido a que en otras ocasiones ingresaron a mis redes sociales usando este equipo y con la versión 70.0.1 todo iba muy bien, me sentía seguro. Con la nueva actualización la versión 72.0.1 esto no sucede, se puede cerrar sesión pero me manda un mensaje que dice: “Firefox se desconectará de tu cuenta, pero no eliminará los datos de navegación en este dispositivo”. Esto para mi representa una gran desventaja, ya que prefiero seguir manteniendo mi privacidad sobre que sitios visito, las contraseñas que introduzco y hasta los sitios que tengo guardado en “marcadores”, en mi trabajo ya me abrieron mi equipo físicamente varias veces y buscan mucha información en los navegadores. Mi pregunta es: ¿hay alguna forma de cerrar la sesión de Firefox Sync y al cerrar que borre historial y marcadores además de otros datos? Que lo deje limpio como si fuera la instalación original. 
</p><p>Gracias por su ayuda.

And i noticed another set of process's opening and closing with fire fox under the name LVPrcSrv except there was one more of these process's than there were of fire fox so as soon as fire fox and the additional LVPrcSrv process's closed i manually ended the last remaining LVPrcSrv process and then tried to start fire fox again and this time it work. I'm worried this trick wont work again so i'd like to ask the Mozilla developer whats actually wrong with my fire fox so i can fix it before it becomes permanently inoperable.

I'd love to hear how everyone tracks their passwords.  I've got so many old user names and different passwords that I can't change that this was a real loss.  I'm gradually placing everything on a page document on my iMac.  Is that safe?  I'm wondering if something like Norton is causing the problem, or it's a problem that Apple can fix.  I didn't want Catalina, but I'm stuck and that could be the problem.   I""m not a tech person.  Documents, emails, photos and music are it. Many thanks and Happy New Year.

As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser, as when I checked Waterfox Classic (The only version I could see offered when I went to check the site to get the browser) to see if those problems followed to it, I learned it did not. However for some reason, Waterfox does not have access to the same extensions I normally use in Firefox. Is there a reason behind this? I am planning to downgrade to the immediate preceeding version of Firefox I have to see if that fixes the issues there but I somehow doubt it. In the meantime, is there a way to get my Noscript, Adblock Plus, and Webroot Filtering extensions to work on Waterfox so that I can use it in the without worrying about ads or potentially malicious scripts until I can figure out what the devil happened to Firefox?

After that, I found that none of them could be installed (they did not even appear in the Add-ons Manager list). In addition, I noticed that the list of recommended add-ons from the Manager's is displayed incorrectly (there are no preview images). When I tried to download a add-on manually from the list by clicking the ""+ Add to Firefox"" button, I received a pop-up message that ""The add-on could not be downloaded of a connection failure"" (I use a wired connection (Ethernet) to my PC, without any restrictions. At this point, I was using Chrome in parallel without any problems). I tried to go to (<a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a>) and found the same behavior. Images were not displayed and extensions were not downloaded (Download failed. Please check your connection.).
</p><p>What I tried to do to solve the problem: reset the default settings; disable syncing; run in Safe Mode; delete Firefox entirely, and install it again. But all these actions did not solve my problem.
</p><p>I will be grateful to anyone who can answer me. I'm counting on you.

A) having shut down my laptop, or 
B) having simply 'quit' firefox, 
I must enter my email address and password again, then enter my phone number so that it can send me a text to the link to the firefox app for my phone (which I have installed), then finally I can navigate firefox as normal and my websites and history are remembered. However, it is not really ""as normal"" because I have to SIGN INTO the websites again. Sometimes it remembers the username and password and all I have to do is click through it, but sometimes it doesn't and I have to manually sign into them. Bookmarks aren't ever saved either. I have attached the screenshot of the screen that comes up every time I reopen firefox and this problem happens. I did not have this problem on my older firefox instillation, just when I updated to the newest version. It is so irritating. If anyone can tell me what to do so that this does not happen, and it remembers me, I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

</p><p>Going to keep this short - but, pretty sure devices have been compromised. Firefox has been acting strange lately. Opened up the package contents of the app (on macbook pro 2012) and saw a chrome manifest folder that seemed to be blocking web access on certain sites. Using a similar computer (with ff installed) and decided to look in the app folder. I saw a blocklist.xml sheet. Wondering if this is something that should be in there by default? Some of the things on the list, are things that i'd more likely need than not need. Here is a list of blocked sites and ip addresses. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Our company uses a proxy in whitelisting mode. 
Until recently, clicking any HTTPS link unauthorized by proxy (403 by Squid) would result in an unambiguous error page informing the user that the connection was refused (if needed, they can open a corporate page showing the most recent hostnames blocked from their machine and request authorization).
</p><p>Now, when clicking an unauthorized link (403 by Squid proxy) in FF, nothing happens. The GUI simply stales as nothing happened. 
To reproduce:
1. Configure FF with an HTTP proxy (squid) in deny by default.
2. Open duckduckgo, search something, and click on any https link that has not been whitelisted in the proxy.
3. After the click, nothing happens -&gt; no error, no information message, nothing.
(in the dev tools -&gt; network tab, one can see a 403 status.)
</p><p>This also happens when browsing websites: if the website includes a link to another website that is not whitelisted, nothing happens, the user is not informed that the host could not be reached.
</p><p>This seems like a mechanism has been broken, as FF always used to inform the user of the host not responding with an error page.

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall.
</p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen.
</p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout.
</p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly.
</p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second.
</p><p>Reproduce:
- client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a>
- client.html: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ</a>

</p><p>When OneTouch is activated, the text 'Securely logging you in...' appears overlayed with the spinning wheel in the popup window. This continues indefinitely.
</p><p>When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next.
</p><p>It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour.
</p><p><br>
Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors.
</p><p>In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute ‘postMessage’ on ‘DOMWindow’: The target origin provided (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’) does not match the recipient window’s origin (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’).' error.
</p><p><br>
I believe this could be a recent issue because I was able to make several payments last month with all settings the same.
I have a separate user.js file that I keep my settings in (I can send it over if required). These settings have not been changed since the file has been created.
</p><p><br>
The following actions have been tried and didn't improve the situation:
</p><p>- refreshing the current profile
</p><p>- disabling all addins
</p><p>- adding <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> into exclusions for 'Block pop-up windows' and Enhanced Tracking Protection
</p><p>- cleaning History and cookies
</p><p><br>
I then launched Firefox with a separate 'clean' profile and was able to make the payment successfully. Sure enough, importing my user.js file broke PayPal. I went through the settings commenting them out by groups.
</p><p>The following setting was causing the issue:
</p><p>user_pref(""privacy.firstparty.isolate"", true);
</p><p>Setting it to 'false' made the PayPal popup window work correctly again.
</p><p>Thought that this would be helpful for anyone experiencing similar issues. Cheers.

But whenever I am on the ""View Page"" inside of the Pinned Tab and click on a page link that would change it to the ""Edit Page"", it opens the ""Edit Page"" in a new tab instead of the current one.

</p><p>It was suggested to change browser.link.open_newwindow to 1 (current tab) and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0 (all).
</p><p>When I do this, it does make the ""Edit Page"" link open up in the same Pinned Tab as the ""View Page"" that I am already on.  But it also causes all of the links in all the other tabs (not Pinned) to also open up in the same tab instead of a new one.  I know that holding down keys like CTRL might help with that, but I also have programs that open up pages when clicked on (you can't hold down CTRL when clicking on the system tray icon).  For example, Howard E-Mail Notifier will open up my Yahoo Mail in the same tab with these settings instead of a new tab.
</p><p>I REALLY don't want to hold down CTRL for links or go through any other hassle or BS.  I just want to see if there is a settings or a way to make it so that links in normal tabs (not Pinned) open up in new tabs, and links in Pinned Tabs open up in the same Pinned tab.

The best fix I was able to find to restore drag and drop proper functionality is to go into ""about:config"" page, find ""browser.launcherProcess.enabled"" setting and switch it to ""false"".
The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).
It's frankly getting ridiculous and extremely annoying by that point. Is there a way to stop FF from screwing my ""about:config"" settings without my consent?

Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks.
Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc.
</p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section.
</p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites.
Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks.
This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find.
It may also be a government imposed function. Either one.
</p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ?
</p><p>WTF ?
I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ?
What the hell are you talking about ?
YOu care about my privacy ? STOP websites from reading my bookmarks !!!!!!!!!!!
Websites should have NO access to ANYTHING. They should not know what browser i have, they should not know what bookmarks i have.

</p><p>My Firefox browser (72.0, 64-bit, Win8.1) became slower at loading pages with the previous update, and I've noticed that it's caused by the same problem on each page to varying degrees.

At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring.

</p><p>Symptom: One day, out of nowhere and not pursuant to any user-initiated Firefox installation, configuration or plugin change, a deterministic set of websites begins to crash tabs immediately on page load.  Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash.  If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in.  Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart.  Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem.
</p><p>I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time.  This happened three times in the last six months.  As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on.
</p><p>Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop:

</p><p>No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation.  On a Linux box?  Seriously?  Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting).
</p><p>By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime.  Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached.
</p><p>I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms.  Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray?  No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday.  That seems unlikely since the crash has happened very frequently since yesterday on a variety of websites:
</p><p>$ sudo zgrep libxul /var/log/kern.log | wc -l
</p><p>32
</p><p>There is a prior bug report describing a similar experience here: <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100</a>
For what it's worth, a coworker on another team at my company also ran into these symptoms and mitigated it on his corporate laptop simply by reinstalling.
</p><p>Is there a way to mine the automated crash reporter data to see if this is an emerging trend of some kind?

</p><p>I'm sorry this is probably going to be a long explanation but want all to have the full picture.
</p><p>Over the years I would always back up my bookmarks as an html file whenever I reinstalled windows, got a new pc etc. One thing it seems I have missed and may be an issue is over the years I never made a firefox account. Just used the browser.
</p><p>Recently like many I'm sure, I updated a windows 7 laptop to windows 10. 
</p><p>This one time, I forgot to back up the bookmarks as an html file, just the rest of my files on the pc. This might of been because of all the chaos at the holidays or because I had already learned that the new windows 10 install can save everything from windows 7.
</p><p>I installed the windows 10 and selected the option to save all files and programs. When the install finished, there it was, what seemed to be my exact windows 7 laptop, files, and programs just with the windows 10 system now. FANTASTIC! All good!
</p><p>Not good. A few days later the laptop would not boot up. It was frozen at the windows 10 logo part of the start up with the spinning and spinning but never opened.
</p><p>Searched online for answers, found some, and tried all fixes. The laptop would also not start the auto repair feature.
</p><p>At this point I had to take it somewhere. I have an online business and of course it was all in that laptop... and backed up from a few weeks earlier.
</p><p>The place I would have taken it was closed for the week. took somewhere else.
</p><p>I told them I needed two things only since the pc was backed up a couple weeks back. 
</p><p>The files on the desktop and my FIREFOX BOOKMARKS! Easy right?
</p><p>They tried I'm sure the same methods I tried to get it to boot. They could not and said they would have to reinstall windows.
</p><p>Fine, no problem, they were told clearly what to save and windows 10 can save it anyway during the install.
</p><p>These idiots did not use the save all the files and programs option. They backed up files to their computers and wiped the laptop clean! Now what?
</p><p>Well we know the installation makes a windows old file and we all know firefox saves bookmark back ups, saves around 15 or so but you'll always have the most recent.
</p><p>This is the problem. Firefox didn't seem to saving the bookmarks or updating the backups.
</p><p>In my brand new laptop I can see in the backup bookmarks folder that it is backing up everyday or so and in just under a week I already have several days of backup bookmarks in the folder.
</p><p>On the old laptop, with the reinstall, the bookmark back up folder in the windows old folder has a list of backup json files but the last json file has a date created of September 2019 and then in the file name it seems to show a date of 12-22-19 which I thought was the bookmarks I needed seeing the December date in the file name. But it's not and they are what seems to be back from September. So why no back up json file for the last three months. I know that seems to be a short amount of time but first, the bookmarks seem to be older than september based on things I was doing at the time and in the last three months I have made major changes in my business and started a new one. EVERYTHING IS MISSING&gt; 
</p><p>Hope I can find some help. I read an article about everything possibly being in sqlite file or something.
</p><p>Thanks in advance.
</p><p>Jon

</p><p>The browser states, ""Information you submit could be viewed by others (like passwords, messages, credit cards, etc.). Your connection is not private and information you share with the site could be viewed by others.""

</p><p>This seems like a contradiction. The browser is telling us that our information could be compromised, while the documentation states that attackers should not be able to access personal data.
</p><p>Can you please clarify which one is correct? Also, if the browser is misleading, it should be corrected in a future update. If the problem is with the documentation, it should be updated.

<p>I have zero issues on Firefox 70.0.1. It's updating that's the problem and I know how to save my previous version to prevent full loss of my profile. I can't even go to safe mode or anything it immediately crashes on startup. When updating to ver 71 I only got 2 plugins which are adblock and a dark mode switch. As mentioned previous even deleting all folders including in the AppData and doing a clean install does not resolve this.

I am taking advantage since a significant number of years of the HUGE history on Firefox-type (I also use Palemoon) browsers, to use these histories AS STUDY NOTEBOOKS. That is: I _always_ open a normal window, a Library&gt;History window, and a private window (_in this order_) and browse _only_ in (the) private window(s). And move (drag &amp; drop) studied pages carefully chosen URLs (page location tags, etc.) to the normal window (and therefore into the History), with the DATE AND TIME). (I know there is an addon for this but sometimes I know I want to save a whole sequence of page so this suits me better). This _time indexing_ and _chronological display_ of visited pages is an _invaluable_ asset in LEARNING (item linked to those visited before and after, work session span, etc.). I use the tags for notes / page extracts (the limited tag length is great because it forces to be concise).
I continuously curate this history and delete LOADS of things that I decide are no longer valuable, but I still have several years worth of notes. So I search and find a page, and its date is more that 6 months in the past. Now (as explained above) I have to navigate to that time to see THE CONTEXT of THAT _learning experience_. But I have so many items in the ""Older than 6 months"" 'folder' that scrolling to the right date _is awfull_ (imprecise, skip over the right date constantly , etc._ : - ( 
Please tell me there is a setting to display all 12 months in the History navigation pane, or an add-on that does that or the full indexing of the History (full years and months hierarchy). If not, please someone do it ! THIS (_empowering_ people to LEARN/ STUDY) WILL change the internet  / world.

</p><p>Ja, Firefox Updates ärgern mich. Ich benutze seit vielen Jahren Firefox. Angefangen habe ich mit Version 4 oder 5, damals wurde noch mit Anpassbarkeit geworben. Anfangs war es noch möglich, durch einen Mausklick zu bestimmen, ob die Tabs oben oder unten sind, dann kam eine neue Firefox Version. Ich habe mir eine UserChrome.css gemacht, die gut funktioniert hat, dann kam Firefox 57? und die Anpassbarkeit war Geschichte. Wer mit mehreren Tabs arbeitet und dafür sind die Tabs doch da, muss die Maus mehr bewegen und es ist unübersichtlich. Wäre es nicht sinnvoll, dass was ich am häufigsten benutze, in der Nähe der Arbeitsfläche zu haben?
</p><p>Wäre es nicht besser die Tab Leiste standardmäßig nach unten zu legen und wer es anders möchte, der kann sich alle 10 oder 15 Versionen, eine UserChrome.css basteln. Das mit den alle 10 oder 15 Versionen, eine neue UserChrome.css zu basteln, ist jetzt wohl auch Geschichte.

</p><p>These overlapping areas use various fonts that provide glyphs for characters inside the Unicode Private Use Areas. Examples are:
</p>
<ul><li> All the things aggregated into NerdFonts - <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts</a>
</li><li> The Powerline shell-prompt symbols - <a href=""https://github.com/powerline/powerline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/powerline/powerline</a>
</li><li> Klingon - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html</a>
</li><li> Anything else in the ConScript Registry - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>So, I'd like to set up my browser to be able to display a few, or all of these things. For example, in the discussion going on at the GitHub issue <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409</a>.
</p><p>But I don't see any way in Firefox to set up a chain of ""fallback fonts"" or something like that. In Preferences &gt; Language and Appearance &gt; Fonts and Colors &gt; Advanced, it gives me a selection for ""Fonts for:"", which allows me to assign fonts on a per-script basis. But:
</p><p>a) assigning a single font for ""Other Writing Systems"" (assuming that encompasses the Unicode PUA areas) is not sufficient, and
b) uh-oh, maybe bug! When I select ""Other Writing Systems"" and choose a new font for it (like the Klingon font ""plqaD""), it changes the main ""Default font"" for me back in the main preferences screen! That doesn't seem right?
</p><p>Thing is, there are a lot of these ""long tail"" little special-purpose fonts, that it would be nice to aggregate into a single viewing context. It would be nice if Firefox supported defining an arbitrarily-long list of ""fallback"" fonts to use in the case where a web page uses a character which is not assigned a glyph in any of the normal fonts.

The library-icon venue disallows dragging, and also has duplicated lotsa stuff during import, plus omitted stuff.
The menu-bar venue allows dragging, but has self-replicated over &amp; over.

This assumes the master password had been entered correctly when prompted sometime after starting the browser.
</p><p>With the Quantum/Lockwise changes, there are multiple, repeating prompts for the master password during the process of accessing the saved login data. Is this a bug, or is there a way to reduce the repeated requests? Because the master password is so important, mine is long and complex. Having to type it in multiple times in the space of a minute or two seems unnecessary and annoying.
</p><p>When accessing Saved Logins, it asks for the Master Password. That's OK and consistent with prior Firefox behavior. But then when I find a login and want to look at it it asks the Master Password again. If I then want to copy it, it asks again. If I look at several different logins, each login, and each action on each login, requires entering the master password over and over. That is a bit much, IHMO. 
</p><p>Once the user has reached the Saved Logins (Lockwise), they should be considered authenticated for the duration working with Lockwise. Further password prompts should not be needed. If Lockwise is closed, then it would be appropriate to re-authenticate.  The page could time-out and auto-close if left unattended for an extended period of time. 
</p><p>Are there any settings to reduce the usability challenges of the current behavior?

Sometimes its videos that no longer play. This time it was images. This time it started with spotify logging me out automatically after I logged in. It did not lag, it was not slow it was running smoothly. It just started to log me out like in 10 sec after login. I switched to Edge and it didnt log me out there. The bug was also in private browsing. Few minutes later I discovered that Aliexpress stopped showing me new images - it would load me images that I had already visited but for new images it would just show me empty box and image alt text. This also broke in both normal mode and private browsing mode. In Edge this also worked so I understood it was firefox problem, not my network problem. 
</p><p>To solve the issue I tried to clear recent history for time range everything and checked cache and offline website data. It did not help. Then I also tried to use forget about this site from history and Ctrl + F5 to make it force reload data. It did not help either. I also tried garbage collection and cycle collection because I thought that something was wrong in the memory.
</p><p>After these operations I tried to manually visit image location which I grabbed using inspect element. It turned out that firefox indeed downloaded the image but it turned out it did not completely download it. It downloaded 8.22kb data instead of 12kb and image viewers were not able to open it while visiting the same url with Edge gave me correct image which means that it wasnt faulty resource on server side.
</p><p>When it previously happened to me videos stopped to play both in private and normal browsing. It also does not seem to be dependent on FF version. This time it happened with FF 70.0. It was not running out of disk space - had still over hundred GB left nor RAM (it only used 25G out of 64G). I use Windows 10 x64.
</p><p>I know I could have solved this issue with browser restart (which I did by now) but but since I usually have a lot of stuff going on and just restoring tabs isn't enough for me because reloading tab from internet does not restore it exactly as it was before since all the JS progress will be lost but sometimes some tabs I need exactly as they were which is why I would not like to restart firefox very often.
</p><p>I would like to know what causes such issues and if there is any other way than browser restart to fix it? Like manually deleting something from somewhere?

I had what I thought was the correct sessionstore.jsonlz4 file for the old session, judging by the file size, but apparently the new session was written into that file, and the old session moved to a section with key ""lastSessionState"".  I could not find any information on opening that ""last session"", so resorted to uncompressing and editing the sessionstore file.  I removed the initial section for the new session, and removed the ""lastSessionState"" key.  The remainder of the file seemed to have the same structure as the initial session section.  Not having an easy way to re-compress the file, I copied it into the profile as sessionstore.js, as, once upon a time, folks said that sessionstore.js would be read if sessionstore.jsonlz4 was not present.  I hid all the files in sessionstore-backups.  However, when I started Firefox, it did not find the old session.  So...
</p><p>Hoping someone knows:  Is there a way to get Firefox to switch to the ""lastSessionState"" session?  Or, do I need to compress the fixed up sessionstore.js in order to get Firefox to recognize it?  Thanks!

Pinned tabs are so unstable that they are basically useless. Currently pinned tabs are unpinning themselves when I load and work in forms on the corresponding pages.

I am certain of this because I have disabled all of them and it still keeps happening. Click tab, work on page, click other tab to do form work on other tab, go back to previous tab and it's not there because it's unpinned. It's gotten maddening to be perfectly honest as there doesn't appear to be any solution to the problem and I've honestly reached the point after this feature being so unstable for so long that I don't understand why the feature even exists since it's never worked reliably sine it's inception.

</p><p>Alright, there was maybe some trouble-shooting I skipped over however this had its reasoning.  However onto the problem.  I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser.  My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ).  The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load.  In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space.
</p><p>I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked.  I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter.  So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe.  However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on.  When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine.
</p><p>Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head.  I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default.  I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem.  Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem.
</p><p>Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet.  Here's hoping I catch some good advice.  :3

</p><p>I have already tried disabling hardware acceleration and have tried running Firefox in safe mode. Neither option worked. I'm getting kinda sick and tired of having to switch over to Chrome every time I wanna watch a video. Some help would be greatly appreciated.

Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit) does not always use GDI rendering,"<p>Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit) is the only version that allows switching to GDI rendering with hacks. The hacks involve setting gfx.canvas.azure.backends and gfx.content.azure.backends to just cairo.
</p><p>Aside from Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8 and Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003, the only browser I can think of where it's possible to use GDI rendering is Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit). But, as the user browses the Internet, that browser eventually deceives the user.
</p><p>The problem with DirectWrite is that the text is rendered with way too many dark gray pixels, causing text to become unrealistically thicker and more distorted. On the other hand, GDI uses correct gamma and fully respects font hinting, meaning text renders exactly as the type designer intended.

Please help.,"<p>I changed the the email for my Firefox account sometime this 2nd quarter I now have two emails for my FF account. But I thought my old Firefox sumo support account had carried over to the new one because around 1st quarter of 2019 I was singing just fine to the new account then about three to four months ago I tried to sign into my new FF support account and it wasn't showing my profile so thought maybe somehow during the transition period it was lost so I made a new profile on there instead by mistake, it was only after I did this did realize that my old account was still on the old sumo account even though they technically share the same email because my FF account has two emails under it. And my Ad-On account carried over to the new one and I didn't update the email on that account it was using the same email that my old sumo account is. This is strange can someone help me I hate to 'lose all the data from my old sumo account' but the time ""I don't want lose my Firefox account either"".

I was worried it was a hardware issue at first, or that it was drivers, but after complete fresh installations and removals with ddu, nothing else having issues for 2 years, and isolating the problem to only occur with firefox open and hardware acceleration enabled and other issues unique to inside the browser, I think it's more likely something on Mozilla's end.

One example is that when I receive an email that contains something I need to print like labels or tickets, Firefox crashes when I try to print &amp; if continue to try to print, it always crashes. Here is an example of a return label.

Another example is downloading. If I try to download, Firefox crashes, again with no crash report or notification to me. Many times when I try again it works the second time. But sometimes it doesnt. Firefox just closes without a trace. Then I have to do restore last session. As I said, with some operations, it works if I do it again, but with others it does not. 
I looked at Windows Event Viewer &amp; the application log. It has many evens for each day &amp; a total of 17,703. I found one from a couple of days ago that mentions Firefox &amp; another one that mentions Software Protection &amp; lists a number of items with a long list of letters &amp; numbers that look like Firefox crash reports  
When I use Chrome, I dont have these problems. So I have made Chrome my default browser although I prefer Firefox if these problems can be fixed. Thank you. Jonathan Rose

Previous versions of Firefox has a list of the web sites with each site's data: last login, create date, login name and optional display of the password (if I recall correctly).  This display made it very easy to sort through all the data and edit it.  The new display makes doing this kind of thing impossible.
Is there (or will there be) an option to display as list?

</p><p>On Chrome and Explorer they work fairly fine (just one small bug that needs fixing, where clicking the ""Close"" button rather than the cross gives an error message ""No results found""), but in Firefox it does not work at all but comes up with ""No results found"" straight away.
</p><p>In safe mode, after deleting cache and cookies, it works fine (or, the same way as in the other browsers), so I'm guessing there's an add-on that stops the third-party server data coming through?

</p><p>This will, of course, be quite frustrating for some of our clients/visitors, as they will not be able to book a session when using Firefox.

The popup appears when I click any link on any page of the site, and when it appears it freezes Firefox so that the only way I can get out of it is to stop Firefox from running by using the Windows Task Manager on my Windows 7 PC. I have uninstalled Firefox and all my Firefox data files, and then reinstalled Firefox, but this did not solve the problem. Thinking this might involve a virus, I have also run Malwarebytes, but this, too, did not solve the problem. Please see attached screenshot.

I'm wondering if anyone else has this problem and if you've found a way around this besides accessing through Chrome and having to tolerate Chrome's retarded ""website unresponsive"" dialogs that constantly come up and it's resource sucking behaviour?

I tried that instruction but part of it kept leading me to FileExplorer C: which seemed very strange to me.  I tried the instructions several times but it always lead to C: so I finally figured these computers are smarter than I so I tried it ;  so all that old FFx data got dumped onto C: .   Someday I'll try to get that off there but I'd still like to pursue getting the data back live.

</p><p>Another suggestion is the [Inspect Element] -&gt; [Network]: enable the user to copy all the URLs on the list, currently, I can only copy one at a time and is annoying, especially for those in the realm of combating malvertising and tech support scams. I could try copying the whole thing, but that would include all the other columns, which results a nasty result when pasted.

Late last week Firefox and Opera could not connect from either Pu or Org while Chrome and Edge could.   
Removing Firefox and Opera from the list of allowed programs in Zone Alarm, cold booting and adding them to Zone Alarm did not work.
I upgraded Opera from 65.0.3467.62 to 65.0.3467.72
I executed netsh winsock reset and netsh int ip reset
As a result Opera can connect to the internet from Ma but no longer can connect from Pu.
After uninstalling Adobe Flash Player Opera was able to connect from Ma.

</p><p>For example, Options - General - Files and Applications - Applications - Choose how Firefox handles the files you download from the web or the applications you use while browsing. Content Type: PDF, Action: [we change it to what we want, such as ""use Bluebeam"" or ""use Adobe"" or ""preview in Firefox"", and then it will re-set to something else, such as ""Save File"" (which saves the file to Downloads and does not open the file in a program)]
</p><p>And also Options - General - Firefox Updates - Keep Firefox up to date for the best performance, stability, and security. 
Allow Firefox to...
Automatically install updates (recommended)
OR 
Check for updates but let you choose to install them
[in older versions of the browser, there was also a third option for NOT automatically checking for updates at all. But newer versions of Firefox do not seem to offer this.]
Whichever of the first two options we choose, we have had cases where Firefox does not preserve the selection and switches the user to the other selection.
</p><p>When the selections get re-set to something other than what the user chose, it likely happens due to a Firefox software update. 
</p><p>I have been told by an IT consultant that the way to preserve the selections is to use Firefox Sync and under ""choose what to sync,"" make sure the ""Options"" box is ticked. But we have done that, and users with Sync turned on still find that not all of their Options selections are preserved.

So I lost my Firefox 52 install with all of my extensions (that still worked).  Now, I'm running v. 57 Quantum, and a few things aren't working correctly.
</p><p>First, the MAJOR problem:  when I open a link from a bookmark, it's clobbering an existing tab that I was using (that's why it was open, obviously).  That is completely unsat and can not be allowed to continue.  How do I correct this?  I can't find the option under settings--&gt;tabs to fix this problem.
</p><p>Second issue (major annoyance):  I can no longer create a bookmark directly in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar.  I used to be able to open that bookmark folder, and the first option was to bookmark the currently open tab.  That option has vanished, and i use that all the time.  How do I restore that?
</p><p>Actually, one more issue:  I have two tabs that are pinned and are supposed to be protected (i.e., nothing can clobber them, and I can't close them without deliberately turning the protection off (context menu right-clicking on tab).  I need that back, because for some reason, firefox thinks it's ok to open a bookmark in those tabs, too, when it most definitely is NOT ok.

</p><p>I opened up the volume mixer and included screenshots below. On the left, when I'm not connected to the headphones, the sound plays via the speakers and you can clearly see mozilla's audio levels in green are ok. When I connect the headphones (middle photo) the sound still plays via the speakers but there are two firefoxes and one is playing audio, the other is not. I don't know why there are two, I only have one tab open. Lastly, when I switch the audio device to headphones, Firefox completely disappears from the list of applications playing audio. I opened up other browsers and played audio in each and they are listed in the applications, as you can see in the last photo. They are actively playing audio as indicated by the green audio levels and I can hear them via the headphones. Firefox on the other hand, is still playing via my computer's speakers.
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea how to fix this? Firefox is my main browser so it's tedious to have to open another browser when I want to watch youtube or listen to something.

The Mac App of Firefox seems to give a much more pleasant experience playing flash games like Alpha Penguin but the Windows Program is extremely laggy. Is there any reason why? Both OSes are using the same hardware to it's max capabilities. 
</p><p>I'd also like to mention that I have an older version of Firefox on my daily solo Windows 8.1 machine and it's lower specked and Flash games like Alpha Penguin play pretty well(there are some lag areas but not as much as my BootCamp situation) but when using a newer version of Firefox on that Win8.1 machine Flash seems to be as equally as bad as the BootCamp Windows10.
</p><p>Then I have a Windows10 gaming laptop and Flash sometimes struggle there.
</p><p>All computers have Chrome and play flash equally ""okay"".
</p><p>Why am I having such an issue with Firefox, so many different results? Is there something I can do for my BootCamp Windows10's Firefox to play as smooth as Firefox on the MacOS side??

When Firefox re-opened a couple of hours ago after I did a 'refresh', the browser 'open-page' tabs were all still there, but my bookmarks had completely gone from both my bookmarks toolbar, and bookmarks library. They were listed in the 'Old Firefox Data' file on my desktop, but as .jsonLz4 files, which neither I, the laptop or Firefox can get to open. I've tried all the suggestions I can find in the help maze,  The bookmark library just says 'cannot process files' when  I try to restore from there. I've checked that the 'places-sqlite' file properties are NOT read only. My menu bar and bookmarks toolbar are both in place and working. Any ideas gratefully received, thanks.

</p><p>At least Chrome and Opera both have autofill that actually works properly - including recognizing fields in online forms, while the autofill in Firefox hasn't worked even close to as well for about a year now.

My wife is now working on my old PC, therefore I removed all old programs and installed just the basic stuff she always uses.
She's also created her own account after installing the latest version of Firefox. I didn't rename the computer, only her Windows useraccount. Also created a new profile, that doesn't help either because bookmarks keep getting synced between two different accounts each on a different PC and I don't seem to get it right. Looked at the different devices that should sync under each account, that seems to be OK. But everytime I make a change in the bookmarks on one of the PC's with it's own account the other one also gets changed under that different account. Can someone help me by taking it step by step, so I can understand what it is I am doing wrong?

I removed the plugins from the directory manually then started again. I downloaded the NPAPI version from adobe (pictured). I then extracted the files and copied the plugin (<a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>) to firefox's plugin path ($MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH, which for me was /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins). I then restarted firefox. However, the shockwave flash plugin is not present in the plugins tab. This is odd as it was a couple of days ago before I redid this. Sites like newgrounds worked perfectly. Back when flash was working, I noticed on some sites that used html5, it would instead try to use flash. For a whille, the openh264 was stuck on ""will be installed shortly."" Now when I go to those sites, it will show the thumbnail, but not play. Youtube videos still work, however. In fact, it's really the only video site that still works. Was there a dramatic change in the past couple of days or something? I didn't even update firefox myself, this happened seemingly out of nowhere.

My mac has the latest firefox installed, currently 71. Whenever I load up firefox 51, when I return back to the latest Firefox my profile has corrupted, specifically:
1) places.sqlite has become places.sqllite.corrupt and is replaced by a fresh places.sqlite- the former corrupt file cannot be replaced/renamed as places.sqlite anymore
2) favicons.sqlite becomes favicons.sqlite.corrupt
3) all addons are marked as disabled. Reenabling them by editing extensions.json (changing all instances of appDisabled”: true to “appDisabled”: false) does not make the plugins enabled again

1) without turning internet off when running up firefox 51: corrupts the latest firefox install - requires redownloading and setting up
2) turn internet off, load up firefox 51, tell it to never update. Then continue closing and loading up current firefox - profile is corrupted as above
3) first Visit about:profiles in latest firefox, set the default profile to a new profile ""switchToMeBeforeLoadingOldFirefox"". Close browser and reopen, note a default blank profile. Close new firefox. Open old firefox without internet at above - frustratingly just doing this with my 'real' profile open in the mac's finder, I can see the sqlite temprary files being created in my 'real' profile when firefox 51 is open, corrupting it all as above.

The behaviors started some time in the last six months or so.  I just noticed them in the last week when I updated the website.  The website is <a href=""https://281connections.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/</a>  and I am using using Firefox 71.0 on Ubuntu Mate 19.04  . . .
Question 1
When accessing the hosted site, the script that toggles the menu to drop down is ignored (<a href=""https://281connections.us/#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/#</a> ).  (Using a Chromium browser, I can get the script to run by telling it to “load unsafe scripts”.)  The script in question is run in Firefox without objection when the same code/site is invoked from files local to my machine.  I can not find a setting in Firefox to allow the script to execute when invoked from hosted source.  I have tried an assortment of settings changes, but can’t find anything that works.  Can you help?
Question 2
Javascript that runs a dynamic page (<a href=""https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html</a> ) runs just fine using Firefox and the hosted website.  However, when invoked on local files, it does not run.  (It presents a large circle, but never fills it with information.)  Is there a setting that will allow me to see dynamic page when invoked locally?  (BTW, the behavior is identical using Chromium for what that is worth.)
</p><p>Last note - disabling extensions does not affect the behaviors noted.

</p><p>I have an Office 365 personal account. When attempting to use FF to log in to One Drive directly -- meaning, I go straight to the One Drive login page via bookmark, and do not attempt to enter One Drive via a ""side door"" such as a link on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> -- I encounter significant latency and, often, outright non-responsiveness. Last Pass will not autofill the login credentials; nor can I type them in directly with anything other than crippling latency, if at all. Same latency with password and 2-factor entry. If I am able to survive log-in, One Drive presents significant lag to clicks, often accompanied by fleeting clues in the lower-left corner of the screen, usually involving cryptography such as ""waiting for cdn-15 <a href=""http://office.net"" rel=""nofollow"">office.net</a> . . . "" or something similar. Often the word ""Excel"" or ""Word"" will be displayed in one of those messages, but they are so fleeting (and appear to be truncated for display) that I can't capture them completely.
</p><p>Switching off extensions appears to have no effect. The lag and general unresponsiveness continues.
</p><p>Interestingly, when I instead log in directly to Outlook (and not One Drive), and then move into One Drive via a One Drive link that is presented in the Outlook waffle button, then One Drive appears to behave promptly and normally. No lag issues that I can determine. (Also, with all FF extensions=true, login and use of Outlook is satisfactory. No problems that I can see).
</p><p>The Windows One Drive app, which runs on the local system, also appears to function normally. I can see/modify files in my One Drive via the local app. That's groovy, but sometimes you need to see the file system in the web browser.
</p><p>So I guess that's the workaround: Get access to One Drive by going *through* Outlook. Okay, but why? What's going on? How to fix?
</p><p>Thank you.

This morning, for instance, I turned my machine on and went to preferences to make sure it was checked and it was already set.  This is strange as its sometimes set and sometimes not set.  The reason I need it set all the time is that roboform also works sometimes and sometimes not.  Between the two its all just a genuine pain in the ***.  
</p><p>My question is simple.  Is there a setting that will force this to be on all the time?  (maybe in about:config?)  Can I add something in about:config to do the job?  My other solution is just change password managers.  That is, probably, the real solution but I am too stubborn I think.

</p><p>Periodically, at unpredictable intervals, Firefox reverts my choice of spellcheck dictionary (English US) to English Australian. In the FF Preferences i don't even have Australian as an option: i have only UK, US, and Canada. Nonetheless, now and then, FF will start marking the word ""color"" as misspelled, at which point i know that the dictionary has once again been swapped out. Right-clicking the misspelled word and selecting ""Languages..."" reveals that Australian is always, without exception, the one it's been switched to.
</p><p>My system-wide language is US English. Nothing, on any of my systems, is configured to use Australian, so FF making this particular choice of dictionaries completely befuddles me.
</p><p>The ""troubleshooting information"" which was automatically attached to this post confirms that i don't have Australian English activated in FF. 
</p><p>How do i keep FF from randomly switching dictionaries on me?

In my bookmarks library I have a lot of folders organized in a tree with multiple branches themselves organized in hierarchic levels.
Sometimes I don't find the bookmark I want to use by browsing my tree, probably because I didn't put it in the right location in the tree.
I can find it by the ""Search bookmarks"" function but this function doesn't provide the bookmark location in the tree (and I don't see any other way to locate it). Thus I can't correct the bookmark location error in the tree.

</p><p>Thanks to Mozilla for continuing to develop such a clean browser, with movies made of GIF instead of much larger files.
</p><p>So we have developed an extension or add-on for many years using the same method. But recently ( maybe I forgot ), with a new developer profile, I am unable to edit any files because the .xpi extension in the extensions folder, is compressed and cannot be navigated in a file Explorer.
</p><p>In the past, I just install the extension and change the file extension from .xpi to .zip, and then extract into a folder with the same name. Then delete the .xpi/.zip folder, and the new folder acts as a pointer for the same instance of installation. And I can just modify the files in that folder usually and I don't need to restart the browser to see the changes. But lately I cannot do this.
</p><p>What is the best way to debug the add-on with the least number of steps?
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>Josh

When I select the correct word to replace the wrong s ""tatistic"" it is like this: sstatistic. You can no longer use the spelling because it becomes so marked that I do not see what is misspelled.

1274726,2019-12-09 21:52:55 -0800,2019-12-10T15:41:27Z,How do I tell Firefox Sync to: Use *this* as my master copy - and propagate it to all my Windows desktop machines?,"<p>HI. I understand how difficult Sync is and have read the deep dive article on how it is being (or has been) rebuilt to work ""properly"".
I have just one question - but here's why: Sync still has the ability to mess up bookmarks between my 5 Windows machines. 
So all I want is a clear way to do this: 
I'd like to fix up all my bookmarks on one machine : let's call it ""A"" - and then propagate that to all the others. 
I tried doing this by 
A. Stopping sync on all, 
B. Fixing up the duplicates, empty folders and other messed up things in bookmarks on A manually
C. Starting Sync again. 
And within a day my 5 hour marathon had been completely wasted as they were in a heck of a mess again. 
Could someone please try and include ""A straightforward way to reset and rebuild your bookmarks- AND SYNC THEM!"" in the design doc?
And put that a set of clear instructions somewhere?
But in the meantime - please let me know how I do this. Surely ""reset  and rebuild from here"" is an obvious requirement?
Thanks guys - this hurts because I'm completely in love with the ""new"" Firefox and how safe I feel with it. So help me here!

1274725,2019-12-09 21:01:56 -0800,2020-01-04T11:05:27Z,"Why does Sync prompt me to install ""on another device"" when this is the fourth or fifth active device I've logged into the account with?","<p>Over the past few days, I've logged into Firefox on a few new devices - mainly, a Windows partition on my computer, and on a school computer.
</p><p>In both instances, after logging in, it doesn't give me any indication of being finished - instead it prompts me to ""install on another device"". Most recently, on this computer, it asked me to send an SMS to my phone to login to Firefox Sync on my phone.
</p><p>This would be reasonable, except for the fact that I'm already using Firefox on my phone, and have it actively logged in with the account I'm logging in to. When I go to look at my devices on <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>, I have 6 devices listed, including my phone ""last seen 7 hours ago"" and my main computer ""last seen 3 hours ago"". It's clear to me that these are active devices, and that I don't need to install on any other devices to get sync working.
</p><p>The main reason this is annoying is that I don't get any confirmation that I've completed logging in - only a prompt to do something unnecessary. I can work around this by simply ignoring the prompt, but I'm concerned for other less tech-savvy consumers who might be confused, thinking they're still not done when they login to Sync on their second device! Imagine someone logs into their phone first, and then the computer - it'd be pretty confusing to then have the computer ask them to sign in on the phone.
</p><p>I personally was slightly confused, and had to double check that bookmarks were actually syncing and that I hadn't accidentally made a new account or done something to erase my previously logged-in devices...

</p><p>I used ShadowExplorer to find an earlier version of my profile folder and copied and pasted it as a backup. I used the places.sqlite from that but I was still getting an empty history and it was also not recording any more new history. I also tried pasting the entire backup profile folder onto the main profile folder. And I tried creating a new profile and transferring my places.sqlite there but I get the same result. However my bookmarks are still there. 
</p><p>Is there no way to get my history back? I'm guessing it is a corrupted places.sqlite. Is it possible to repair the places.sqlite? Sadly I don't have any knowledge on how to use SQlite shell to repair it myself. It would be nice if someone could do that for me! Strangely, the places.sqlite file size is 10240kb, which seems a bit too small for my entire history. 
</p><p>I'm terrible at explaining things so I apologize if it was hard to follow. I'm distraught about this and pretty desperate to get my history back. I'd appreciate any help.

</p><p>I will upload screencaps if needed, but I am going to a banking website, entering UID &amp; password, and telling FF to update the password.  Not only does it not update for that UID, instead putting it into the ""no username"" storage for this website, but it is storing asterisks (in the same amount as the actual password) instead of the password.  Yes, I clicked on the little ""eye"" next to the password field under Tools.Options.Privacy .. and yes, I tried trusting and just using the stored password both for the UID (it kept the old password) and also for the ""no username"" and neither works.  I can update the password manually when under Tools.Options.Privacy, but I do not have the time nor inclination to do this for hundreds of logins.

However there's not means of archiving, syncing or backup for all your fastidious work configuring your various websites to open within specific containers. If your local Firefox profile is lost, so is your hard work with container setup. We need means of backing up our container setup, either via some export / import utility or using Firefox Sync. Either is fine as this extension is a more advanced feature, but totally awesome! Thanks.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu)
</p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible. Keep in mind it is already installed. I want to find the page for it at <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> so that I can reinstall it in the future should I need to do a fresh installation.

It seems to always open on Windows' 1st monitor, which for me is almost always turned off.
Of course Windows in it's infinite wisdom will not let you choose which monitor is number 1. This basically makes the feature useless. :(
So, is there some setting somewhere in the about:config where I can control which monitor is default? I can't find an obvious one, at least.
EDIT: I was wrong. It doesn't always open the video on the 1st monitor. It just always opens the video on the monitor to the left of the one the browser is on. :D

On Google Play you can review installed extensions in Play Store easily by click each of them and use the one-tap rating button.
On iOS, if you allow them, App Store will even prompt you a one-tap rater after you've installed some app and used for a while, which is even more convenient.
I wonder if Firefox (could) have the same experience. Without it, it's harder to encourage people (who wish to spare the time) to involve in the rating system.

Now if FF crashes for some reason or there is a power outage, sometimes session restore only works for one profile that is restarted first, while the others lose all the tabs that were open last time. Now I have a feeling that this is much more likely to happen if the browser was recently updated (it happened several times on the first restart after the update).
I reckon that this might have something to do with the session restore only restoring one of the opened windows (which, as I understand, is now fixed).
In each of the profiles the automatic session restore is set on.

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected. 
</p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there.
</p>
<ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install. Stylus also doesn't work, and all my styles have vanished. Tampermonkey worked running a script on Youtube, but once again, on startup, the script was gone.

Prior to trying to enable it for Firefox, I succesfully enabled two-factor authentication for my Facebook, Google and Microsoft accounts.
After trying it for Firefox, I also did it for my PayPal account, so the Authy app doesn't seem to be the problem here.
I tried typing the six numbers with and without space in between and multiple times in two consecutive days, bot nothing seems to work.  I read the QR code succesfully and added Firefox on Authy, but the code just always seems to be incorrect (I'm not sure how to translate it in english, I am using Firefox in Finnish, see the attached image). I censored all the codes in the image.

1274489,2019-12-06 13:54:52 -0800,2019-12-21T18:51:11Z,Can't Log In to SSA Website,"<p>About six months ago, I posted here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504</a> b/c I was unable to log into the AT&amp;T website.  Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment.
</p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again.
</p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem....
</p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.  And just FYI, the rep also agreed that my ad blockers should not have been an issue.  Reluctantly, I went to MS Edge - I was able to log in.   I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible.
</p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password.""
	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway
	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.'
	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.  However, I do not use the 'saved log ins' feature or use a master password - I get the impression that is what would be affected if I followed the provisions outlined, and so may not apply to my issue.  Right?
</p><p>All that said... does anyone have any idea why I cannot log in to the SSA site using FF?

Any help will be appreciated.,"<p>I have done everything that is in the support answers, but to no avail.  When I open FF in my jalopy (10 yr old computer), all my current bookmarks, and history for the past 5 years are still there.  After copying the profile, and the entire Mozilla folder (separate attempts), and over-copying the folder in my new computer, there is no change; the files only go back to when I first installed FF on it.  None of your support answers say anything about whether to copy the jalopy files into the local, or roaming folders, so I copied it into both.  Still no difference.
</p><p>In a related migration/replace problem, I cannot sync my new computer with the old, even though they're both in the same account name.  The jalopy and new computer names are both recognized in the jalopy, but the new computer doesn't pick up the old computer name.   This was the first thing I tried to reconcile the two machines.  I am extremely frustrated, and at my wits end dealing with this problem.  Any reasonable assistance and solutions are appreciated.  Thank you.

This is done with the Task Manager.
However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks.
Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10.
I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes.

Maybe I just missed it and I would simply like to know how to not have any buttons open the browser.

1274472,2019-12-06 10:50:10 -0800,2020-01-26T10:58:29Z,"how to stop all tabs? ""Offline mode"" does not stop connection attempts","<p>tell me who knows, how to stop all tabs? Even when I enable the ""offline mode"",  tabs with heavy javascript continue trying to load, consuming CPU resources. I want they to stop immideately. I tried different extensions, but results are unsatisfactory. Does anybody know some trick?
My goal is to find a method to flush all javascript structures in RAM. I explored about:memory, and tried the vmmap.exe (process memory analyzer) from the Sysinternals Suite, but I have not succeeded so far.
Auto unload tab -- is not a solution. For example I clicked on links and opened 30 tabs in background. PC starts working very slow, Now I want to stop all them, and to read the loaded information (webpages). How to do it? I think it is the weakest side of Firefox. Needed to abrupt all attempts to make network connection, after the ""offline mode"" is enabled.
I need something to stop javascript's attempts to connect, to calm it down. I want to start read webpages already loaded, and javascript occupies CPU. To kill threads in the Process Manager is not a way to do at all, Auto-unload also, I want to read those webpages.  I have enough of RAM, it is not used more then a half. 
Many years ago, when there was HTML4, I used for a little the Maxton browser. It had a button to stop all pages. All similiar Firefox extensions do not act effectively like that.
the issue not in scarcity of RAM, but in a badly design of browser's architecture, that javascript occupies users' PCs.

</p><p>I went through various processes to try and resurrect FF, but without success --- FireFox would not run.

</p><p>I made an alteration to the ""about:config"" which seems to have stopped the automatic updating, albeit the ""FF Icon"" still wants to function as ""Updater"" and I get a message (when started) saying FF is unable to update to the latest version - ""click here to download etc.,"" which of course I don't do and FF continues to perform as expected - albeit 65 and not 71.

</p><p>I log out of devices that I do not own when I'm exiting Firefox. Today I opened Firefox on a device that I'm 100% certain I logged out of yesterday - and found that my bookmarks, bookmarks bar, and add-ons were already visible and active, and one of my add-ons was already logged in. 
</p><p>I verified that the Firefox Sync / login screen showed that no one was logged into the Firefox account, and then I logged in using my usual credentials. It reflected that I was then logged in, but everything else remained visible. 
</p><p>I followed Firefox instructions for viewing the logs, and strangely, there was no log. I went up a directory, and found that all the logs were in the 'failed' directory. Clicking on each of the failed subfolders shows only: ids	[]
</p><p>This is very concerning because it entirely negates the security and privacy aspects of having a login. I was not logged into Firefox - and the Firefox interface confirmed that this morning, in addition to confirming it when I logged out yesterday - yet somehow not only were my personal bookmarks showing, but one of my add-ons was also logged in, providing further access to anyone who might have opened a Firefox window from this device.

The other is AnonymoX which I use for general purposes.
</p><p>A few days ago I upgraded to Firefox 71.0 as well as updated my Windows 10 to the latest 1903 version. Today I noticed that both extensions have stopped working. AnonymoX just doesn't work, whereas the other plugin, upon activation, says (translated) ""Conflict detected! Proxy settings are controlled by a different plugin or cannot be set up"" Trying to circumvent a block (and only then - unblocked websites work fine) now either redirects me to the ISPs blocking page, or alternatively produces a ""Secure Connection Failed PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR""  message after a long TLS handshake. Running the same extensions in Chrome does not reproduce the issue - blocked websites become accessible as usual. The issue also persists for three different connections - a public wi-fi network, a private network and a tethered 4G connection, all served by different ISPs. Finally, I am not running any anti-virus software or firewall. Thus this seems to be a Firefox issue and not a system or network issue. 
</p><p>This also doesn't seem to be an issue with the country's blocking system itself because other users around me are still able to circumvent blocks using the same extensions and I am able to circumvent blocks using a similar extension on my Android phone with a local SIM. 
</p><p>Things I've tried so far:
1) Made sure that both Windows and Firefox are set to not use a proxy
</p><p>2) Reinstalled the extensions
</p><p>3) Created a different profile in Firefox. The extensions don't work in the new profile either, although the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR does not appear - I just always get redirected to the respective ISPs block page
</p><p>4) Cleared all cache, cookies, site settings etc.
</p><p>5) Deleted the cert9.db file and let Firefox recereate it
</p><p>So far nothing has worked. I'm frankly at a loss here. I have half a mind to just reinstall Firefox altogether since this is not my main PC and losing bookmarks wouldn't inconvenience me on it, but figured I'd ask here before.

1274301,2019-12-04 14:02:33 -0800,2019-12-06T17:38:45Z,What caused profiles to torque two days ago?,"<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask the question that comes at the end of this note.  If you scroll to the end, you can see it marked as MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
</p><p>As I was posting the question, I took advantage of the moment to reflect on the fact that FireFox's perseverance over its long history of ups and downs today has made FireFox one of the real hopes for humanity.  Long Live FireFox!
</p><p>Back in the dark ages, before the ascendance of Google's Chrome browser, I learned to recover FireFox's guts, to cope with its gastric spasms of projectile digital vomiting, which seemed to occur every few weeks.  Most software in those days contributed full shares to the unusable stew, made the accumulation of digital barf that needed cleanup as often as I needed to clean up after hangovers from over drinking when I was a stupid youth. Those were the days when running a computer all day without being forced to restart taught me to weild Windows Task Manager as weapon, which usually provided a side step around enough of the binary vomit top cut restarts from 4 a day to only one or two.
</p><p>Years later, while Microsoft was recovering from the largest, most expensive public mistake in software history (Windows 8), Google got a handle on Chrome.  After that, around 2014, Google either found Popeye's spinach factory, or aliens joined them in their Mountain View offices, because no human force can account for the rate and quality of significant upgrades to all their systems since then, for Chrome browser, underlying Chromium technology now used by everyone, not just for browsers, but all manor of application software to run on all kinds of platforms, Android for phones and apps, YouTube video processing that spots copyrighted sound and images in every video that has it, the world-leading advertising systems and dashboards, and their search engine so much better than anyone else's our choice is to use Google Search or be stupid and slow, or use Google Maps or be lost.  Google pumps out new and better software features one hundred times faster than any other organization.  If you missed the media reports explaining this, that is because Google's super productivity has not been celebrated in anything like the degree warranted. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, Google also has become so evil  it probably cannot be prevented from destroying the system of human checks and balances invented in the United States 240 years ago. As simple and feeble as those checks and balances are, without them it is hard to see how any substantial part of the human population ever could have experienced and lived with Liberty and the productivity it makes possible.  For example, without the Liberty growing throughout the world after taking its initial root in the United States and our written Constitution, one of the most ingenious and consequential documents ever written, the normal result of military conflict would have been one murderous, tyrannical, wholly self-serving dictatorship or another forcing 99% of the human population to live as serfs or slaves in the involuntary service of people like you know who.  Google and the rest of the power players in commercial media are destroying that, through political bias they lie about.  The problem with their lies is they have the power of their media platform to perpetrate them.  Google is evil and needs to be neutralized.  The main thing I can do about this is to stop using their products.  The other thing I can do is tell people about what is happening.  I was raised to see things this way, but for until recently, I did not see this is the way we have to look at things because this is the way that works.  Until recently, I did not know society cannot stop functioning, but now I know that the functioning we all take for granted, including the people fighting against it, is rare as diamonds when viewed in the context of human history, Some of the people attacking our country want to break it down, because they want the United States to become like the places people now leave in order to come here.  The sickness is the same that has affected all gluttons for power.  They have learned that force of military arms tends to galvanize people like you and me.  Instead, they lie to us. pretending to harbor the same loves for life you and I have, when in truth they see us is idiot patsies, making us deserve their the damages wrought by their treachery.
</p><p>Therefore, I stopped using Chrome, returning to the FireFox way of browsing.  I was with Chrome so long, I forgot all about recovering browser profiles.  FireFox is a lot more reliable today than it was before Chome blew everybody out of the water, but its profile system still ha regular bouts with projectile digital vomiting.
</p><p>Today, my FireFox is not blasting bile all over the house, but is being rather brave holding the contagion within itself. I noticed passwords not filling into web forms that used to be there. I am not sure of the timing.  I probably was a long time ago, but I kept getting messages from FireFox babbling about their new security system.
</p><p>Today, I needed to identify active profile (i.e., the one I use) from the half dozen profiles piled into my FireFox installation.  I don't know why there is more than one.  Unfortunately, I just could not glean the one I need to look at from their names:
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p>The online guide provided the usual waste of time.  I asked the computer how to know which profile is the active one.  I immediately found thousands of articles which each spell out the same eight or ten reasons why a person might wish to know which profile is active. The people writing these articles know their articles are filled mostly with spam (information we already have or don't need), but their editors are evaluated on word count, needed for diluting the concentration of ads in their publication.  It's been years since the ANSWERS were easy to pick out of spam portions of the articles they appear with.  From this agony-inducing swill I found information that looked like it might tell me how to spot the active profile.  ""Look for "".default"" as part of the profile name.  So I looked again,
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p><br>
All of the profile names contain "".default.""
</p><p><br>
MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
Then I noticed the dates
</p><p>Months ago   b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
Months ago   n34593ht.default-release/
Two days ago   n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
Today  q412vz1p.default/
</p><p>Evidently, two days ago, FireFox ditched my profile and gave me a new one.  This leads to my question, my reason for posting this thread:
</p><p>Why?
</p><p>In other words, 
</p><p>Why did FireFox ditch my profile and give me a new two days ago?
</p><p>I understand, you probably don't know why in my particular case.  I am hoping for reasonable guesses or possibilities.

Firefox only brings up the default within the program. There are no other choices. After a couple of tries, I see that it won't keep it in default nor allow me to use it even once. I have to use the ... bars for the Print command as an attempt as the regular Printer icon in the tool bar is only for the Firefox default.

Except for Firefox. No matter which page, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Twitter... no sound for videos. Firefox is quiet. If I check my sound settings, the bar for sound input is not even moving, seems like Firefox is just not recognising or forwarding any sound to my USB G560 speakers.
</p><p>On the other hand, everything works in Google Chrome and sound is brilliant. The problem just seems to be with Firefox. I disabled all audio devices, especially my old audio-out where I had my old speakers. I updated the drivers for Realtek HD Audio (even though I am sure I do not need them for the G560) and also updated again driver for the G560 as well as the Logitech G Hub. Firefox is also the latest version.
</p><p>But nothing. Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560.
</p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices. Re-Installing the G560 drivers does not change anything.
</p><p>So if I wanna have any sound in Firefox I am depending on the error message popping up... which happens only rarely. But that can't be the solution :( It seems to me the problem is with Firefox, in the way it handles the sound channel or content or whatever... and does not recognize my G560 via USB as speaker system. Even though it is the only one set active in my system.

This is with multiple types of Logitech webcams. I've tried to disable all security settings, disable hardware acceleration but none of this works. The webcams worked fine in lower builds. All is fine in Google Chome. Webcam works immediately so this issue is definitely a Firefox problem. I've tried multiple machines all loaded with Windows 10 or Windows Server 2012 R2 and no plugins.

</p><p>I use Firefox across my devices (after 5 years of Google Chrome and other Google services). I found one missing piece on the Firefox product in general. It doesn't sync my settings when I log into the new device. The settings I'm talking about are Search Engine and Notification, although I think this can be applied to any other settings that I'm not using or aware of.
Long story short, since I quit using Google Chrome (although I can't quit using Android, I still disable Google services and provide with least of permissions to any services on the mobile device) I switched back to Mozilla Firefox browser and using in on all my devices (Windows, couple of Linux Desktops as well as Android) and I found that when I login to my Firefox account I still have to change Search Engine from Google to DuckDuckGo and I wonder why Extensions are being installed and synced while search engines are not. Also same thing for Notifications. I don't like being notified and disable all kind of notifications for all Web Sites (no exclusions).  Can you please include these pieces to sync when login to the account or have a checkbox in case if some users want to keep different settings on different devices etc...?

</p><p>I just got a new Windows 10 computer (Dell Inspiron 15 15000) and transferred all my stuff including firefox with all the tabs I had open.
</p><p>I usually have lots of tabs open, and I opened all the tabs on my new computer that I had had on the old one.  For some reason I can't recall, I ended up with one window with one tab, and one window with all the tabs I'd had open on my old machine (including the one that was open by itself in the other window).  I closed the window with the single tab, and continued using the window with many tabs.  At the end of the day, I closed the window as usual and shut down the computer.
</p><p>The next day, I turned on my computer, opened up firefox, and no tabs!  I checked to make sure that ""open previous session at startup"" was checked in the main settings, did some searching through the help files here, and found that the problem was that I hadn't gone in to the privacy settings to tell it to remember history.  I fixed that, and did some more digging to figure out how to restore history, I don't remember how.  I restarted Firefox, and it restored a previous session ... but not the one I wanted.  It restored the window with the single tab that I'd only had open for about ten minutes, not the window with all my tabs (including that one) that I'd had open all day.  Some more searching through the support here and I figured out how to restore the session I ACTUALLY wanted.  I can't find the post now, but it told me to go to Help - Troubleshooting Information (I think--it LOOKED like the Troubleshooting Information page, from what I remember, although today it doesn't seem to have the option I used yesterday, so it might have been a different page) and see if there were two sessions, and if so, to click the other one, and see if that fixed things.  It did!  I got the window with all the tabs back, and closed the window with just the single tab, and went on with my day.  Problem solved, right?
</p><p>No.  I booted up my computer today, opened up Firefox, and what did I find?  IT OPENED THE WINDOW WITH THE SINGLE TAB THAT I'D ONLY HAD OPEN BRIEFLY, INSTEAD OF THE WINDOW WITH ALL MY TABS IN IT THAT I'D HAD OPEN ALL DAY.  First of all, I'd rather not have to deal with this again, so how can I make sure it doesn't?  What is going on?
</p><p>Second, I can't find the help page that told me how to restore the correct window.  This is a problem, because although all of the tabs I had open yesterday are in my history, when I go to the little library icon and look at ""history"" both the ""recently closed windows"" and ""recently closed tabs"" are empty.  As far as Firefox is concerned, I haven't closed any windows or tabs since the last time the history was deleted, despite having lots of pages in the Recent History list that I sure don't have open right now.  Clicking the three horizontal lines to get the main menu, there is no ""restore previous session"" as an option.  I can go through the history and manually click on all the tabs that should be open, but that is REALLY a pain and I would like not to have to do this again.  I have added the ""Tab Session Manager"" addon, so hopefully even if this is a recurring problem I can use that to get around it.  (The addons listed below are all the addons I had when the problem occurred.)  What the heck is going on here?

I've had the  issue for about a month. I've found it incredibly handy to open the download folder from the drop down menu of the download icon. And that option is not available if the the download fails. Instead, a repeat download icon is displayed. So, I've had to comply and re-start the download every time. 
</p><p>Wondering if the first download was indeed faulty, I navigated to the download folder using Explorer and found the page replicated just fine. But it turns out that the second download screws up my fonts and formatting. This I did not know until today.
</p><p>To see if I could figure out the difference between the first download and the repeat thereof, I created two folders, 'first' and 'second' as sub-folders to the download folder. Because I would overwrite the files with the repeat download, I preserved the first download by moving those files into the first folder. The first folder now contained a .htm file and a files sub-folder. The original download location was empty. I then repeated the download, and found but a single .htm file was downloaded. 
</p><p>When I open the single .htm file, the fonts are messed up as well as the formatting. So, thinking that the second download needed it's _files directory, I copied that back, and sure enough everything looked good again. I also compared the first .htm file with the second, and they are identical.
</p><p>My next test was to copy (not move) the _files folder to preserve it, between the first and second download, then compare them. There are differences! There's an extra .htm file in the first download, that's missing in the second. There's an extra .xht file in the second download that is missing in the first. There's a zero length file in each download with unique names, not in the other: mark1_data exists in the first download; a_data in the second. I assumed that zero length files would be fruitless to test further.
</p><p>I next tried to add the missing .htm file from the first download into the second _files folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting. I also removed the extra file from the second folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting either.
</p><p>I'll attach the difference listing between the _files folders. The left side has red highlighting and is against the first _files folder and identifies files present there, but not in the second. The right side has green highlighting and is against the second _files folder and shows files present that are not in the first. I'll also attach a sample of good fonts/formatting from the first download, and bad fonts/formatting from the second.

But the one aspect which i hate, because I'm a green, is its power use. And don't tell me it's due to add-ons, because i've disabled all my addons and it still happens, and it happens when i just start up so it's not build up.  
This spike to 25% (always 25%!) has happened to me over multiple versions for years- it's a built-in FireFox bug, so please please please don't blame it on others. Just FIX IT!

Then I copied my profile from Firefox over to Firefox Nightly and the same problem was replicated.
</p><p>Currently I have found four add-ons that do not load correctly: Fast QR Code Generator, Forecastfox, FoxClocks, uBlock Original
</p><p>The problem I'm  getting is that for the add-ons I either just get the icon and that's it or in settings, only half the settings are loaded and I can't save any modifications made.

Now we have to Switch to New Computers provided from our management-company with an older ESR-Firefox 68.2.
Sometime running firefox --allow-downgrade works, somtimes not.
This is a big Problem because a lot of passwords are saved in the profiles and the ""new"" passwort page makes it very complikated to simply take some Screenshots of the Passwords to a new computer.

Chrome has this very convenient feature that keeps a history item from opening on top of your current page - often you want to compare or add what you saw in history to what you're seeing on the current page without making the current page disappear and having to backpage, thus losing the history page you want displayed at the same time. This seems like an easy enough feature to include that FF is ignoring, like it ignores the longtime request that Firefox enable cut &amp; paste to retain website formatting and functions when pasting into an email (and screenshots don't retain functions like links). If there are enough inconveniences to using FF, people use another browser, and if Chrome and Safari can include such conveniences, so can Firefox.

Obviously this looked fishy to me and I didn't click; instead I killed Firefox via the command line and then restarted it.  When I did, one of my windows didn't look right (I had two windows open, each with several tabs)-- the tab bar at the top just cut off halfway through one of the tabs instead of me being able to scroll over.  In addition, right after I was playing a game on my computer and part of the game board froze.  Now everything seems normal.  Is it possible I managed to end up with some malware even though I didn't click on the link?  Has anyone seen this particular scam before?

I have tried using the ""custom"" option and deselecting the 4 tracker options but every site still has ETP enabled, and it is far too time consuming to have to manually turn it off for every website I visit. I would like to find out 1) what I'm doing wrong that the method I've tried to disable ETP isn't working (yes, I reload the page every time), and 2) is there an ""about:config"" tweak that will turn off ETP globally, as in across the web, and on every new FF session I start? I really don't care who tracks me, but I do care about a feature that makes browsing more tedious and painful. I am using Chrome and Opera in the interim between discovering this annoying ""enhancement"" and when the FF developers fix it so it can be disabled with one click on a more global and permanent basis. Chrome and Opera don't break websites by default.

I recently noticed that decoding youtube videos in 2160p60fps is choppy beyond recognition.
</p><p>Diagnose:
While playing said videos in firefox i was able to observe in the task manager that actually none of my graphics cards video decoding capabilities were used. At lower video qualities/resolutions the hardware accelerated video decoding of the graphics card was also not kicking in, but in these cases my cpu was still able to cope with the decoding load, so I never noticed the missing hardware acceleration.  To narrow the origin of problem down I tried watching the same videos in edge, chrome and even downloaded a short 2160p60fps clip to play with VLC and everything worked fine, just not in my favorite browser firefox :(
</p><p>What i already did trying to solve the problem (in order):
-Restart Firefox without addons
-Refresh Firefox
-Create a new Profile
</p><p>Additional Info:
Nvidia Driver Version 441.20

As the problem still persists and the developers of babylonjs told us to report this to mozilla, we decided to ask the question here first, because we have no idea how to fix it and it is only appearing on Firefox.
</p><p>Here you can see the history of our post in the babylonjs forum and a playground link to see the behaviour :

Websites ask for permission to send notifications, and now I can't put it off, I have to decide immediately if I want the notifications, or to send them away forever. Even if there may be some way to reverse the effect later, I do not like at all having to make a decision that has some apparent finality about a website I do not know yet. I can't bear the question looming over the page, either, but as it stands, all I can do to make it go away is to click one of the two entirely unacceptable options. I don't want such a final decision on every random site I come across. I want to go back to putting it off until later. Please tell me how to make this stop!

""Disappears"" = turns white (despite background or other colors) and becomes non-actionable (screen shot attached).
Possible connection: it most often happens during or after using the horrible Blackboard program (web-based version) for my online classes. However, I have seen it happen when Blackboard was not currently in use, and once it happened after a reboot when Blackboard had not been used at all that session.
If I have multiple browser windows open (which is rare--I use tabs), they are all affected at the same time.
If I close Firefox and open it in a new window, the problem exists on the new window too.
When it happens, the only recourse is to reboot my computer entirely.
Aside from changing the auto-download location, I have not customized Firefox and have not installed any plugins. (Some may have been installed automatically such as those for Microsoft Office.)
HELP?????
