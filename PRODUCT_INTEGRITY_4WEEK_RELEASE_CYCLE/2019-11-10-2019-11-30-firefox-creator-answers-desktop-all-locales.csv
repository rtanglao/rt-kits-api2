I've had the  issue for about a month. I've found it incredibly handy to open the download folder from the drop down menu of the download icon. And that option is not available if the the download fails. Instead, a repeat download icon is displayed. So, I've had to comply and re-start the download every time. 
</p><p>Wondering if the first download was indeed faulty, I navigated to the download folder using Explorer and found the page replicated just fine. But it turns out that the second download screws up my fonts and formatting. This I did not know until today.
</p><p>To see if I could figure out the difference between the first download and the repeat thereof, I created two folders, 'first' and 'second' as sub-folders to the download folder. Because I would overwrite the files with the repeat download, I preserved the first download by moving those files into the first folder. The first folder now contained a .htm file and a files sub-folder. The original download location was empty. I then repeated the download, and found but a single .htm file was downloaded. 
</p><p>When I open the single .htm file, the fonts are messed up as well as the formatting. So, thinking that the second download needed it's _files directory, I copied that back, and sure enough everything looked good again. I also compared the first .htm file with the second, and they are identical.
</p><p>My next test was to copy (not move) the _files folder to preserve it, between the first and second download, then compare them. There are differences! There's an extra .htm file in the first download, that's missing in the second. There's an extra .xht file in the second download that is missing in the first. There's a zero length file in each download with unique names, not in the other: mark1_data exists in the first download; a_data in the second. I assumed that zero length files would be fruitless to test further.
</p><p>I next tried to add the missing .htm file from the first download into the second _files folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting. I also removed the extra file from the second folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting either.
</p><p>I'll attach the difference listing between the _files folders. The left side has red highlighting and is against the first _files folder and identifies files present there, but not in the second. The right side has green highlighting and is against the second _files folder and shows files present that are not in the first. I'll also attach a sample of good fonts/formatting from the first download, and bad fonts/formatting from the second.

The feature is color customizing (I'm distractable and glare-sensitive so white text on a gray is a big deal to me). 
But the one aspect which i hate, because I'm a green, is its power use. And don't tell me it's due to add-ons, because i've disabled all my addons and it still happens, and it happens when i just start up so it's not build up.  
This spike to 25% (always 25%!) has happened to me over multiple versions for years- it's a built-in FireFox bug, so please please please don't blame it on others. Just FIX IT!
I use FireFox as little as possible and the second some other maker adds white text, i'll ditch Firefox.  Because Mozilla, like all institutions suffers from NIH.  (Not Invented Here.)

I've cleaned out my history and cookies etc. I've tried messing with every other setting I could find. With ""manage permissions"" I get a gray window with no option to add a site. And now for the first time ever, I cannot get to the about:config page. Firefox keeps diverting over to my internet provider's search page.

Chrome has this very convenient feature that keeps a history item from opening on top of your current page - often you want to compare or add what you saw in history to what you're seeing on the current page without making the current page disappear and having to backpage, thus losing the history page you want displayed at the same time. This seems like an easy enough feature to include that FF is ignoring, like it ignores the longtime request that Firefox enable cut &amp; paste to retain website formatting and functions when pasting into an email (and screenshots don't retain functions like links). If there are enough inconveniences to using FF, people use another browser, and if Chrome and Safari can include such conveniences, so can Firefox.

I really don't care who tracks me, but I do care about a feature that makes browsing more tedious and painful. I am using Chrome and Opera in the interim between discovering this annoying ""enhancement"" and when the FF developers fix it so it can be disabled with one click on a more global and permanent basis. Chrome and Opera don't break websites by default.

The URL I was wanting to use is  ""https:// fileconvertor . org/info/resize-convert-files-quickly/?id_encode=206432b3Iub3JnL3BkZmxpdmUv&amp;rid=11608&amp;source=google-d&amp;c=firefoxgdn&amp;cid=388081882754&amp;aid=78965711920&amp;kw=convert+a+document+to+pdf&amp;target=&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx9v9q46J5gIVpgutBh2aIATjEAEYASAAEgL3QPD_BwE"" Does anyone know what I need to do to get this issue resolved so I can continue my conversion?

Problem is when I'm downloading something with Firefox the progress bar on Firefox icon (in the MacOS dock) is too dark and you can't see clearly how much progress downloading something is made.
Can this be changed my user or can I request that Firefox fixes colors so they be more bright?
See example in attachment picture.

1273774,2019-11-26 14:40:59 -0800,2019-11-27T06:23:03Z,Hardware Acceleration works everywhere except in Firefox.,"<p>The Problem:
I recently noticed that decoding youtube videos in 2160p60fps is choppy beyond recognition.
</p><p>Diagnose:
While playing said videos in firefox i was able to observe in the task manager that actually none of my graphics cards video decoding capabilities were used. At lower video qualities/resolutions the hardware accelerated video decoding of the graphics card was also not kicking in, but in these cases my cpu was still able to cope with the decoding load, so I never noticed the missing hardware acceleration.  To narrow the origin of problem down I tried watching the same videos in edge, chrome and even downloaded a short 2160p60fps clip to play with VLC and everything worked fine, just not in my favorite browser firefox :(
</p><p>What i already did trying to solve the problem (in order):
-Restart Firefox without addons
-Refresh Firefox
-Create a new Profile
</p><p>Additional Info:
Nvidia Driver Version 441.20
</p><p>If there is anymore useful info I'm more than happy to provide it. 
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time reading this an providing help.

Its detecting the portal and prompting me to accpet the risks and continue. But clicking the button to continue does nothing. Just sits on same page. I saw a post about the new captive portal features and to go into about:config and look for network.captive-portal-service.enabled and setting it to false, but seems a bit extreme to expect users to do this. 
As a work around I open up chromium and log in that way.

""Disappears"" = turns white (despite background or other colors) and becomes non-actionable (screen shot attached).
Possible connection: it most often happens during or after using the horrible Blackboard program (web-based version) for my online classes. However, I have seen it happen when Blackboard was not currently in use, and once it happened after a reboot when Blackboard had not been used at all that session.
If I have multiple browser windows open (which is rare--I use tabs), they are all affected at the same time.
If I close Firefox and open it in a new window, the problem exists on the new window too.
When it happens, the only recourse is to reboot my computer entirely.
Aside from changing the auto-download location, I have not customized Firefox and have not installed any plugins. (Some may have been installed automatically such as those for Microsoft Office.)
HELP?????

There is no reason for this. I manage multiple YouTube accounts and have since abandon three of them over this. It's not even worth it anymore. Why am I being signing out every time I restart my Mac? I scavenged through the settings and there's nothing on ""mass sign me out of all websites when I update FireFox or restart my computer"". I can kill/ force quit FF and everything is still signed in, it's only when either FF updates or I restart my computer. It's sickening and a burden, hopefully; this isn't some key security feature that Mozilla thought was a great idea. I need some easing and for someone to tell that this is an easy fix and not some b.s. bug that will never be patched.

Cuando quería entrar a facebook, me aparecían guardadas otras cuentas de 2 personas que no conozco,a una de ellas se podía entrar, pues su contraseña estaba guardada.
Cuando quise entrar a cuentas de google, y buscar alguna de mis cuentas, encontré que hay otra cuenta desconocida que tampo es mía, a esa no pude entrar.
La verdad no entiendo como esas cuentas pudiero quedar registradas en mi cuenta de firefox sync. lo unico que s eme ocurre, es que el firefox sync este fallando y enlazando cuentas que no son.
o que algun complemento de firefox hubiera vulnerado esa seguridad.

</p><p>Since a few months ago, Firefox started syncing add-on settings without giving you the option to opt out of it. I'm not talking about syncing the add-ons themselves which is a great thing and also the user can turn it off. I'm talking about add-on settings, syncing of which can be problematic. For example, I have a few website blocker add-ons. I have given these add-ons a list of websites to block on my older son's computer, while I have given them a different list to block on my younger son's computer. This is not viable anymore because Firefox syncs all their settings without asking me. The other problem is that even the disable/enable option of these add-ons are synced, which means that if I have these website blockers enabled on my sons' computers, they are also enabled on my own computer. Consequently, if I disable them on my own computer, they will be disabled on my sons' computers. This is a major issue. I have previously contacted Firefox about this, but I assume it has been lost in the large number feedback that they receive.

</p><p>I currently have the firefox free extension of windscribe and run Windows 7.  After alot of trial and error, I have found that windscribe is causing my homepage to load twice when I log on to it.  I have changed the homepage to several different URL's and it makes no difference.  Turning it off does not change the double page loading, I have to completely disable it to stop that from happening.  FireFox version 70.0.1
Windows 7 SP1
Only firewall is windows firewall and the firewall on my modem
I have firefox addons ghostery and Adblock ultimate (please note, I disabled these addons while windscribe was enabled and still had the problem but if I disable windscribe, I do not have the problem)
</p><p>I found this................and BTW, i've notified windscribe but they say it is a browser problem.

This worked fine. We now have a working profile each, and the original default profile as a backup.
So each of us opens our new Firefox profile and wants to delete the bookmarks that are not ours. We delete the folder.

</p><p>I never did any housekeeping on this mountain of logins.

</p><p>I've read there are other ways to sniff the browser than a few ""general.useragent..."" prefs, but I'm no expert.  Doubt they are, either.
</p><p>They must use a contract vendor to run the site.  It's been &gt;&gt; a month since 1st asked them to tell me what they use to sniff the browser, because it was up to date &amp; ""general.useragent.override"" reflected that.  Generally, their IT dept isn't very helpful.  I had to call them to tell them to upgrade OpenSSL when the big bug surfaced while back, after ~ 90% of financial institutions had upgraded.  They knew nothing of it.  Still waiting for a ""thanks for your help."" 
</p><p>For grins, I entered a science fiction blended UA string just to see what their system would say:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)  Gecko/20100101 Chrome/74.0.3729.169.
Obviously, Chrome doesn't use Gecko engine.
</p><p>So their site didn't complain about outdated browser or screwy UA string.  Their site displayed the same as always.  I purposely mixed &amp; matched the string.  In fact, I didn't change the UA string back to a valid one yet &amp; this site is displaying OK.
</p><p>One issue in using any browser in LInux (as useragent string)  is a very small pool of users, increasing fingerprint ability.
If I found out that most sites (if using desktops) work fine, even if you spoof the OS AND browser, there'd be a much larger group of Windows 10 / Chrome users vs. Linux / Fx users.  
</p><p>Tor Browser spoofs the OS (same for all users) but not the browser.  Has anyone ever tried this - recently - to see how many sites broke?

Unfortunately, some of those folders are now empty, with no bookmarks in them anymore, and I cannot figure why this has happened.
I have certain folders that have several internal folders in them, and they were all full of bookmarks that I needed, but now almost 3/4 of those folders are empty. Has Firefox randomly deleting bookmarks now for some idiotic reason, and if so, how do I get them all back where they belong??
I swear, I am 2 steps away from giving up on Firefox completely now, because very time I blink, something else is not working right, and now I am not even allowed to keep bookmarks. What group of monkeys has taken over the Firefox browser project, and why can't they keep what used to be one of the best browsers out, working correctly?? 
Can Mozilla PLEASE get their browser back up to snuff, and stop making it fall apart?? I don't want to switch to chrome, or any other browser, but Mozilla's incompetence with Firefox, is going to end up forcing me to!!

</p><p>Since updating to version 68, when I hit CTRL+S on a page, I get a little yellow dot on the download icon. This is something that has shown up a few times - it means something didn't download. But always if I click the icon I can hit the circle arrow thingy and it will complete the download. So naturally I did that and it said the download completed. But when I went to look for it, it was not there. Sometimes the folder is there with one or two files - or no files. 
</p><p>But here's the wacky thing: if I DON'T attempt to refresh the download and just go to my Downloads folder - the entire page is there. The whole thing. Fully downloaded. But the little yellow dot is on the download icon and there is a circle arrow thingy saying it didn't complete. If I click that circle arrow thingy - after seeing the files had downloaded - it will tell me the download is complete, but the files will have disappeared!
</p><p>If that ain't a bug, I don't know what is.

</p><p>I'm still using an older version of firefox to keep essential add-ons that Quantum no longer had.  I'm having problems on a windows 7 computer with the version I have on it, and would like advice on the best way to proceed.  
</p><p>I had copied over my profile from a different computer where I'd been using FF55.  I'd had some problems with 55, so I installed 52 on this computer, but using that profile.  It's not working very well as I can't get vertical tabs or vertical tabs reloaded to work, it's also crashing fairly often for no apparent reason, etc.  Now even the ""+"" symbol to add a new tab has disappeared from the tab bar, and I don't have a clue why or how to get it back!).  For what it's worth, this isn't a malware/virus problem - I'm running McAfee and also periodically malwarebytes etc., and scans aren't finding problems. Computer has been restarted several times and so on, and I'm still having the problems.  Could this be because the profile was from a firefox 55 version and it's being used on a FF52 version? Or would that not cause this sort of problem?
</p><p>I don't want to go to 56 because I gather it won't be able to access my older saved sessions (I use Session Manager and those are the sessions I'm concerned about - so if this is NOT a problem, please let me know).  I'm concerned about this because wiki says:  ""...Another change was the introduction of the mozlz4 format, a proprietary variant of the lz4 compression format (.mozlz4 and .jsonlz4 file extensions instead of .json.lz4 as per unix/linux standard). Session data is stored in the lz4 format instead of plain text. Firefox 56 can not recognize the legacy plain text session files, only the lz4-encoded ones....""
</p><p>So I'm wondering if I should go to 55 on this computer, or 52ESR?  I gather the ESR would have better security - but want to know if there's a difference in add-on compatibility or other features since 52ESR is, I gather, based on older code than 55?
</p><p>If someone could talk me thru the pros and cons of using 55 versus 52ESR I'd sure appreciate it!!!
</p><p>Also, I would be VERY grateful if folks could point me towards:
1. a reasonably safe site where we can search and install legacy add-ons
2. any webpage which has a good information showing which legacy add-ons now have reasonable replacements in the current FF version.

I noticed this issue quite a few times: When I open the cookies privacy settings, the two buttons ""Clear Data"" and ""Manage Data"" often appear grayed out.
I don't use private browsing or disabled offline cache like I saw in other threads, and I use only 4 regular extensions.
The funny thing is that the buttons become functional on their own after a couple of minutes if I just leave the tab open.
So it seems that Firefox is running some very long process before enabling these buttons the first time the settings page is opened.
If I close the privacy settings tab and open it again, then these two buttons immediately appear enabled, not grayed out.
</p><p>Firefox should probably change the very confusing and counter-intuitive way it is handling these two buttons, or at least display some animated icon to indicate it is doing some stuff, but if it's reading all cookies before deciding to enable the two buttons (and I don't think I have an unusual number of cookies), I'd rather have Firefox enable these buttons immediately and run this cookies analysis process AFTER I click on one of these two buttons, not before.
By the way, it would be great if the about:support page could provide the number of cookies or web sites with cookies so we might use this for technical support. I have no idea how many I have and if this number is a problem.

</p><p>Also, when I first open Firefox after changing the size thus, it sometimes defaults to full height (though Private windows still never do) and sometimes opens to full height, but shifted up slightly so the bottom doesn't quite reach the taskbar and the top extends slightly past the top of the screen.

</p><p>Back in 2015, Mozilla destroyed the search bar by removing the text labels, making it almost impossible to search because you can't find the engine you want. They also removed the ability to switch engines, meaning you have to nominate your engine every single time you search.
</p><p>On top of this, Mozilla reversed the order you do things: It used to be that first you chose the type of content you wanted, then you thought about your exact query. But now, you first have to specify your exact query and THEN think about the type of content you want to search for, which is totally counter-intuitive and terrible interface design. It's like being asked for the name of the meal, movie or book you want, before you've even decided whether you want a meal, movie or book!
</p><p>The reason Mozilla gave for these awful changes was to ""make searching faster"", but that simply is not the case. The new search bar requires just as many clicks, yet it's drastically slower to use as it's almost impossible to find the engine you're looking for from all the unlabeled engines. Plus, having to type your query first is completely counterintuitive to the user's thought process and slows things down even further.
</p><p>Solution:
</p><p>For a couple of years, Classic Theme Restorer was the perfect solution, bringing back the old bar exactly as it should be. However, since Firefox Quantum, Classic Theme Restorer doesn't work, so I've been using Jefferson Scher's excellent userchrome script. (Thank you Mr Scher!)
</p><p>Sadly, with Firefox 70, the script seems to be broken again and many of the engines are missing from the list. I've tried taking the script directly from Jefferson Scher's website, but doing so just makes text labels disappear. It just seems to be broken again.

This is odd because have been I using FF as my main browser for a while now - I would expect consistent backing up every day.
So why are the backups so unreliable? Is there anything I can do to make sure FF backs up every day (like it is supposed to!) ? My FF installs are kept up to date.

Because I am forced to create a new profile I can´t access the original profile with the certificate I need. 
I tried going to about:profiles and setting as default to no avail several times.
I have tried the firefox.exe -P command as well. 
I can´t import the cert9.db file to the certificates setting. I also tried moving the cert9 file to another profile while Firefox is closed but I because I must create a new profile when I open it again and can´t switch profiles once its open it doesn´t make a difference.

Is there another way around creating a new profile? Or anything I´m not considering?

</p><p>Finally decided to make a topic about it as all of my attempts in the past few months to fix it have been in vain.
Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally.
</p><p>I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed.
</p><p>The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it.
</p><p>(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text)
</p><p>From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates.
</p><p>Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here?

5 - IT manager (me) have to move (!) because you need to upgrade workstaton Y firefox to let the user A works, but this time it will upgrade to 70.0.3;

After spending ten minutes filling in all the crap they want for me to establish an account, I added them to 1Password and opened the application.  The FIRST instruction is for the User to ADD the site they will be using Authy to retrieve an Authentication Code in order to log into Firefox.  I typed in Firefox and you are NOT in their list of supported applications.  Facebook, Twitter, Chrome, etc. are all there.  Moreover, I could NOT add Firefox as one of their supported applications.  I had to submit a request.
Did it EVER occur to the Firefox Developers that maybe before you throw up a list of Authenticator Apps that support FireFox, that you first determine if they actually do????????    This is sixth grade coding and a waste of thirty minutes.  It makes me question if any of the supposed features in your browser are anything more than ""Vaporware"".    Listed features that are supposedly running in the background, but actually aren't even coded in.  
I'll skip your security features since its obvious you don't have a clue how to implement them, or they are just there for another type of ""fake marketing scheme"".

</p><p>This is the response I got from Humblebundle, this is included because I know the first response will be it is not firefox it must be the site.

</p><p>Hi there,
</p><p>Thanks for writing in! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble.
</p><p>I believe this is an issue of your browser blocking multiple download from the same site. I have attempted the bulk downloader myself on Chrome and had success with the bundle you mentioned, so that is the only factor I believe may be holding you back. There is an article regarding this issue for the Firefox browser here:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075</a>
</p><p>Installing that add-on may help you correctly download the products in question.
</p><p>If you continue having trouble, let me know and I can discuss this issue with my team further. We may not be able to provide an immediate solution, but we can hopefully address this issue in future updates to this feature.
</p><p>Kind regards,
</p><p>-Finn

</p><p>Sorry if a similar issue has been posted and fixed before, but I wasn't able to find a solution.
</p><p>I am using Firefox 70.0.1 on Win 10.
Audio is fine in general.
However, when I try to skip ahead in a video (YouTube, e.g.), I can hear a very small but audible ""pop"" sound from my headphone, which is super annoying.
My UNEDUCATED guess is my headphone seems to turn off instantly when the video starts buffering, and then turn back on again when buffering is done.
Any idea I can deal with this issue?
</p><p>Thanks in advance.
</p><p>I am using a bluetooth headphone.
I have tested Edge, Opera, and Chrome.
Edge is behaving the same way as Firefox does.
Chrome and Opera is fine without that ""pop"" sound when skipping video ahead.

With Javascript, I change divs, tables, &amp;c., from display:none to, e.g., display:block.  All the attributes work EXCEPT the background image.  So, for example, if background color is #000000, the background shows solid black, and if I change that ahead of time or even on the fly to, e.g., #FF0000, the background changes onclick to solid red.  But, the background image appears pretty much at random as the computer pleases.  So, for example, the background-image is set by css for a table where display:none is the setting.  The template changes the table to display:inline-block.  The table appears, the background color appears, but often no background image appears UNLESS I open the console and uncheck, then recheck some property, e.g., height, associated with the background image.  If, however, I set the initial table property to, e.g., display:inline, the initial result shows a bunch of garbage, but once the display is switched to inline-block, all the background images appear normally and regularly.  This appears to be some kind of bug with Firefox, but for the life of me, I cannot fix it.  If the display of an element -- article, div, table -- starts in the css as ""none,"" the background image often does not appear when display is switched on.

Final step was to see if th the FF/sync was working in the new mac and then the number of connected devices to this account: the message I got is that ESR associated but the last time it was active was one month ago. Meaning that ESR lost the ability to sync (w/o any alert) one month ago.

</p><p>Acabo de instalar Debian 10 Buster. Viene con Firefox ESR por defecto ya instalado. Tengo el sistema en español y el mapa del teclado en español de España. Funciona correctamente en todo el sistema excepto en Firefox.
</p><p>Tengo Firefox con la interface en español y tengo seleccionado el idioma español en las opciones de Firefox correctamente. Lo que no soy capaz de arreglar es que el teclado escribe como si estuviera configurado en inglés, o sea, me cambia muchas teclas de sitio, ni siquiera tengo ñ
</p><p>He instalado Thunderbird y se comporta igual. He instalado Chromium y lo mismo. El resto de sistema responde al teclado en español, el entorno está entero en español. Si hago un ""dpkg-reconfigure locales"" me aparece sólo el español tanto en el idioma predeterminado como en el mapa del teclado. Como decía, Firefox, Thunderbird, Chromiun e incluso Chrome aparecen en español, el idioma seleccionado en opciones es español, pero me escriben como si tuviera el teclado en inglés. Por supuesto he probado varios teclados a sabiendas de que no es ese el problema.
