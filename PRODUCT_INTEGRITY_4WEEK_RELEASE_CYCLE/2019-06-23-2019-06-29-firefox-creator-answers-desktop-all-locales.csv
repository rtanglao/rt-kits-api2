It sucks to have to spend an hour or so re setting up your Firefox after an update where some dev figured since he liked the new setup everyone would so lets force everyone to use things the way we want them and screw anyone who has it set up the way they want it. As you can tell im rather upset about this would it be so hard to put an option in the menu to set focus on search bar not address bar so that the people who are used to it one way don't have to spend a chunk of their day trying to get their homepage and Firefox back to the way it was, Useful.

</p><p>It looks like the (usually perfect) CCleaner Windows utility cleared all of my Firefox history. I also just did a Windows Update but I don't think that did it. This was a very focused cleansing. In places.sqlite, the table moz_historyvisits is empty. Neither mos-places nor moz_bookmarks reference any of the sites that I've visited.
</p><p>I really don't understand how that happened. I did not do a purge or reset or any other Firefox operation. I do not have any addons that purge history. The last Firefox update was several days ago. For purposes now that's not relevant.
</p><p>I looked in the bookmarkbackups folder and got yesterday's backup, but that file only has bookmarks, no history. (I searched for title text from a site that I visited yesterday and it wasn't there.)
</p><p>Question 1 : Aside from local user-managed backups, is there any other place where I might find a copy of places.sqlite and/or all of the history links?
</p><p>Question 2 : I'd like to understand why there is a bookmarkbackups folder, but not a historybackups folder. I'm guessing this is related to security, but we don't even have the option.
</p><p>Question 3 : Maybe I'm missing something or looking in the wrong place. Is there an option to save history somewhere? There are a lot of addons to clear history, but I don't see one for saving it.
</p><p>Question 4 : I haven't looked in my Android folders yet (I need root access or a remote explorer to see the Firefox data (sigh) ) ... Does anyone know if there might be a backup of history in my phone from that app?
</p><p>I posted another note in the forum area for Sync to see if there might be a backup of my history still available on a server which was shared with my Firefox/Android app.

To test my new Progressive Web App and its Service-Worker, I'd like to switch off temporary firefox from the network access. For this purpose, I though to use File-&gt;""Work Offline"". What I observe is that in ""Work Offline"" mode the access to internet is disable (as I expect) but the access to my local web server for development is still avalaible (and I'm surprise about this behavior).
To make sure that the Browser cache is not responsible for this behavior, I have clear the cache and disable the cache. Still I get the unexpected behavior: In ""Work Offline"" mode, Firefox can still request and download data from a localhost server!
If I stop my localhost server, then Firefox complains about the missing data. Which is what I expect and what I also would like to see in ""Work Offline"" mode.
What is the expected behavior of the ""Work Offline"" mode for the local servers? Is the current behavior a bug?
I have also tried Chromium and it behaves as I expect, i.e. in ""Work Offline"" mode access to internet AND local servers are prevented.

The usual way to feed it, is to use a vector drawing application like Inkscape to send it some data. If I open an SVG with Firefox and hit print, that driver gets a rasterized version of that vector image, while the Microsoft Print-to-PDF driver receives vector data. 
Is it possible to force Firefox to send the same data to the LaserCutter driver than it sends to the PDF printer driver?
Right now I use the detour through pdf as a workaround, but it would be nice if we could just Lasercut from the Web directly.

No new tabs are shown in the synchronized tabs section of the firefox account menu accessed from the button on the toolbar.  I also tried syncing while both tablet and pc were in incognito mode, but no tabs are shown in the incognito window either.
</p><p>I could understand if it were designed this way. Personally, I think the whole instruction on firefox sync is too basic and should be expanded. I was thinking about doing it myself but I wanted to run this particular functionality by the community before I consider it a fact.
</p><p>Edit: I'm also unable to send open tabs from pc to tablet, incognito or not. I have v67.0.4 on pc and 67.0.3 on android. As far as I know, the only way to interact with your firefox account in the mobile version is to go to settings -&gt; account. Synced bookmarks go to a new bookmark folder, e.g. desktop-bookmarks. Same for history. But I don't know where to look for synced tabs. I'd expect them to just appear among your opened tabs as soon as you sync you account, but that clearly doesn't happen. But the fact that [right-click tab-&gt; send to device] on a desktop tab lists the tablet as a target, and even displays a SENT! message, suggests that it should be possible.

At the office we use roaming profiles. Until now everything worked fine.
Until we got upto version 67.*
Many users get an error that their profileversion doesn't match the firefox version.
I have the TS on version 67.0.4 but the client computers have most 67.0.3 because updates do not happen at the same moment. Updates will be applied when computer is on but nobody is logged in.
But if somebody already on 0.4 version goes to a computer with version 0.3 they get an error. 
They need to create a new profile and then they can update ...
Then they call me where are their favorites etc ..... Then I restore their profile and everything is working again as it should But the version error I never had and we already use this sins 01/2018 .....
If the versions difference is VERY large I can understtand .. but 67.0.3 / 37.0.04 is just a minor update.
So tonight i'm forced to update all computers to make everything even .......
</p><p>Why is this an issue now and can it be turned 'off' again?

When I enter it it then displays the t-mobile logo with dots on either side that swing back and forth and will just do that indefinitely. When I try  to log into the CapitalOne website the home page comes up, I enter my log-in info, it goes to page <a href=""https://myaccounts.capitalone.com/#/welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myaccounts.capitalone.com/#/welcome</a> and then should redirect to <a href=""https://myaccounts.capitalone.com/welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myaccounts.capitalone.com/welcome</a>, but does not and it loads a blank page. This may have started about time they updated thier website but I cannot be sure. There have been a couple of other sites as well but cannot recall at the moment which ones. IE works fine, and Firefox 52.9.0esr on my old XP computer works fine (but of course is not secure).

</p><p>Here's some feedback.
</p><p>I noticed that there's something missing.  Well,... If you were to manage to handle it, you may be THE FIRST ONES TO HAVE IT IN YOUR BROWSER !
</p><p>What i am talking about is a ""rolling"" theme.  With which I mean a continuously changing theme, as follows.
</p><p>An example would be that a user could be able to e.g. chose 5 (or more) different themes and that these would roll at the top of the browser, with a preset time of x seconds or x minutes, either to be determined by the  user or by Mozilla.  Here I believe it will all depend on the type of software you will be able to build and of the security for the browser, no ?
</p><p>Out of experience, I know that this technology exists, having been a weboligarch and having built and serviced 5 websites on different subjects.
In order to recuperate some of the money I spend on the costs of the webspace, programs, etc, I added quite a few, but not too much, publicity banners on these websites.
The banners led either to click-through, buys, etc. and herewith I earned a certain amount, not enough to get all of the money back, but that was never my purpose.
</p><p>Now, if I remember well, these banners were made in Javascript or Java.  If someone with you knows either which language, then my proposal could be of effect very soon.
</p><p>Lots of success and many thanks for your help !

In order to rectify this I need to restart Firefox and re-enter my pin (on a site which requires it). If an external application uses the Yubikey as a PIV card (for example Windows Remote Desktop) the dialog asking for the pin (within Firefox) opens. If the box is closed repeatedly without entering anything in the text field (eg holding down the Esc key) the box re-opens forever. If the something is entered into the box, then there seems to be *a chance* of the box closing and staying closed, but if this happens the box will re-appear whenever any traffic goes between the browser and the site requiring the use of the Yubikey (navigation to a new page, submitting a form etc). This seems to happen regardless of whether or not the input to that dialog is the correct pin for the card, or random text.
</p><p>The Yubikey is available to Firefox using OpenSC - the card is configured pointing to ""C:\Program Files\ OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\onepin-opensc-pkcs11.dll"". Logging into the Yubikey within the Firefox security devices settings view does not seem to change its behaviour with respect to this issue.
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and navigate to a site which requires the use of PIV functionality and enter the correct pin for the card.
2. Start an external application and run it in a way which also requires the PIV functionality of the Yubikey.
3. Go back to Firefox and refresh the page.
4. Enter the correct pin for the card OR mash keyboard.
5. Restarting Firefox will resolve the issue, until another external program which uses the Yubikey as a PIV card is run again.

This slows down the application startup, which is mildly annoying, but more concerning is that I cannot figure out why it is doing so. The only add-ons I have installed are Evernote Web Clipper, Privacy Badger, Foxy Gestures, Speed Dial 2, and Video Speed Controller. Even with all these disabled the Wine explorer.exe process shows up whenever Firefox is running, so I do not think it is an extension issue.

The theme I was using (Firefox 2, the theme) is no longer supported (or really any such complete theme.  I am hoping that it might be possible to create a CSS file that I can drop into the chrome sub-directory in the firefox preferences that will attempt to recreate that look.  I know, what I want is a terrible ancient look, but I find the so-called modern look horrible (there is no accounting for taste).  Is this even remotely possible?  Or should I just start looking for some other webbrowser (which might be very difficult, given the O/S I am using).
