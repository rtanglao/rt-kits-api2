Hopefully someone can advise on this. On the website <a href=""http://Pixiv.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Pixiv.net</a> Firefox seems to have trouble loading some of the tabs when I go from image to image after opening maybe 20 or so tabs. The content on the page is gray and requires a manual refresh. This does not happen in Chrome. Not sure if someone is able to reproduce this on another computer. Screenshot attached. I have plenty of memory 16GB with an i7 Processor. On Windows 7 Ultimate.
</p><p>To reproduce, search for a tag in pixiv like car for example. Then open 20 or so tabs and sift through them. Some of the tabs content will not show anything. Pretty much occurs every time randomly.
</p><p>Edit 9/2/19: I'll keep this question up since someone may want to reference and fix it. I moved back to Chrome, there are just way too many issues with FireFox that still need to be addressed, especially the over aggressive filter modes in In Private windows.

I signed in to sync and found zero tabs there. None. All the bookmarks are in place, the history is there, but no tabs.

I was then given the opportunity to label the bookmark with my choice of verbiage and place it in ""bookmarks menu"" or ""other bookmarks"".

Recently assembled a new computer, quite expensive and powerful. And there was a problem with Mozilla Firefox. No other browser has such a problem. Namely: pressing the ""scroll"" button on the mouse does not work, i.e. I cannot hold down the ""scroll"" button and move the content of the page up and down and right and left. How can you turn on this button, as it was before on another PC. This is the first problem. The second problem is that when you create a new tab or open a page in a new tab, two of these tabs are created (attached image). Two identical copies.  It's as if the mouse is double-clicking. But that's not true. I checked in other browsers. The mouse is new and working. I also checked with all the disabled add-ons. Help me solve these problems.  Thank you.

I found my way into a place on FF where I was able to 'forget' a website which seemed to fix the <a href=""http://vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vegas.com</a> site. However after trying to make a reservation on the site later in the evening the same problem appeared. Pick travel date particulars and the site skips over what should be the next twp steps (booking the hotel &amp; flights) No amount of cookie and or history clearing seems to make the site work again. Seems to me that the security built in to FF is a tad too strict or something and keeps sites from loading correctly, Redbox still will not remember my log-in credentials from step to step while trying to rent movies on line. Anyone else have some suggestions? Disabling all Tracker / Ad  Blockers does not seem to help either.
</p><p>As before, these problems do not occur if I use MS Edge.
</p><p>Since my move to a new PC running Windows 10 64 bit and with the latest version of FF a couple of websites that I frequent no longer work. They will work in MS Edge, but not Firefox. These two websites are <a href=""http://Redbox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Redbox.com</a> and <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a> For Redbox their system can not seem to retain my login information during a session. Each thing I try to do asks me to reenter my log-in info. Can no longer rent movies. For <a href=""http://Vegas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a>, if I try to look at Air/Hotel packages the website always skips the pick a hotel and pick a flight steps and goes right to the option to pick a show to see. Again, this does not happen if I use MS Edge. What could be going wrong with FF new attention to privacy and security that is breaking these sites. I have shut off Content Blocking on both of these sites already.

It opens up a new, clean profile in a new window (About FF now says 68.0.1 in this version of FF, and it downloads 68.0.2 and prompts to Restart FF (again)).

Things then run routinely for a few hours or a day, before the whole routine starts over again.
</p><p>Alternately, if FF 68.0.2 is not running, if I open it (after opening and closing it several times without issue), I will get a message that ""You've launched an older version of FF, Create New Profile or Quit"".  Create New Profile leads me through the routine above.

</p><p>I'm using Quantum 68.0.2 with the Google homepage as my start page.  In recent weeks Firefox has begun to save my search history across multiple sessions (image 1), without any settings having been altered.  This is alarming, as not only have I instructed Firefox not to save search history (image 2) and disabled history in Sync settings (image 3), but as you see I've also set it to clear history when closing, which of late seems to do nothing.  Even after clearing history manually, searches I've made days ago still pop up in my Google suggestions after restarting the browser.  Everything you see in purple is stuff I searched for last Friday, and even had the computer shut off over the weekend.
</p><p>This happens even if I restart Firefox with all add-ons disabled.  I've trawled the forums looking for a solution, but everything I've found is pretty old &amp; involves ""about:config"" parameters that no longer apply as of quite a few versions ago.
</p><p>Notice I have Google search suggestions turned on (image 4), but from my understanding this is separate from saving history, and should merely suggest frequently searched keywords.  Of note is that the history in image 1 does not show up if searching Google from the address bar.
</p><p>Completely at a loss for how to fix this.  Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Firefox is almost getting useless due to this blocking,"<p>Firefox is far too extreme in blocking access to websites preventing me from browsing for ""connection"" and ""security certificate"" so-called ""issues/errors"".  It almost regularly attempts to block me from accessing websites such as, for example, CNN (!!)  for security certificate issues, and in many cases absolutely will not allow me to browse to some websites.  This gets to the point where I have to switch to a different browser to visit websites I have been using for &gt;&gt;decades&lt;&lt;.  How can I **completely** shut off ALL Firefox security monitoring to allow ME to decide what I want to view? 
</p><pre>Just FYI, I have NO PROBLEM with websites tracking my visits, I actually prefer that.  As well, I have NEVER seen any problems with security certificates endangering me at any of the websites I view, whether the website's certificate is current or not.  I am quite capable of judging for myself whether a website poses any danger to my PC, and I have an AV utility that does an excellent job of protecting my PC, I do NOT need any help from Firefox. I never visit websites that would even remotely present a danger to my system, I am not into games, dark web idiocy, or any other such dangerous sites and I know what to look for to decide the reliability of any site I visit.  I have NEVER, in over 25 years, been hacked or endangered, so I need no help from Firefox.

</p><p>If I disconnect my internet, Firefox 68 starts instantaneously.
</p><p>If internet is available, Firefox is taking 45~60 seconds to appear. Worse, while it is background-starting, it is also freezing my UI (Windows Explorer (W7-64)) during the entire time it is conducting these private transactions.
</p><p>After searching for a solution via the forum, reading the support docs for ""slow startup"" (why do they always steer me towards the ""it's not us"" solutions?), I decided to monitor FF with my TCPViewer.
</p><p>After what I found, I decided to create a Firefox account (I didn't want to), just so I could report this here, and hear what people might say about this. Is this happening to anyone else?
</p><p>TCPView showed me eight (8) local ports opened by Firefox (not a problem, part of the architecture, local is blazing fast), followed by 5 to 8 remote TCP ports-- some to a distant 443 (https, and secure), but also a few 80's (http, insecure).
</p><p>One transaction, which was repeated on two consecutive startups, was a pull of more than 550MB from a site belonging to Microsoft (per GeoIP).
</p><p>Please note that my Firefox has uBlock Origin as its only Add-On. I upgraded to 68 because 67 wouldn't stop popping the ""update available"" message, and now I've also added my own policies.json (so I am now free of the pestering). Are these factors?
</p><p>My bottom line question is, why so much remote data exchange before completing startup?

The technician put my files on a new laptop. I then downloaded Firefox onto the new laptop. I tried to login to my account, but it didnât accept my last known password. The system forced me to create a new account and wiped out all of my information. Now that I can get into the system, I see that a recovery key can be created in case the password is forgotten. I donât recall creating a recovery key before, but the system never asked me for one. It just made me create a whole new account and lose everything. Anyway, in the recovered data, there is a file called âOld Firefox Dataâ from 8/11/16 although strangely the file says last modified 4/15/17. Iâm not sure what any of this means, but is there a way that I can restore at least some of my old bookmarks and information from this file?
