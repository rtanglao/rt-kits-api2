</p><p>I only reboot the PC about once a week, and my wireless Chromebook worked OK accessing weatherbug. 
</p><p>The first thing I did was to clear Firefox’s cache &amp; cookies. That let weatherbug’s first page load, but I could not navigate, &amp; clicking on its different options just gave a spinning circle. Closing &amp; reopening Firefox gave the 502 Bad Gateway message again. IOW clearing cache &amp; cookies was good for a one time only first page load of weatherbug.

</p><p>This error began after my PC suffered a significant error that crashed out most active programs, including Firefox; attempting to start Firefox again caused the relatively common ""Firefox is already running but is not responding. The old process must be closed to open a new window"" error to pop p, with the options ""Close Process"" and ""Cancel"". Clicking either button caused the error message to become unresponsive, and after a few minutes a second identical error would pop up (without the original one ever closing); sometimes when there were several unresponsive errors it would sometimes crash Windows Explorer if I tried to interact with new popups. In Task manager there were multiple Firefox processes running, but attempting to ""End Process"" would not end two of them, they simply stayed there active. By this point I'd resolved all other issues from the PC crash, as far as I could see, and no other programs were showing any issues at all.
</p><p>I restarted the PC several times but the error persisted; I was able to create a new profile in Profile Manager but this did not stop the error. I uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted the parent.lock files in the Appdata/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles folder (they were 'in use by Firefox' if I didn't uninstall and restart the PC first, even though no Firefox processes were listed as running in Task Manager). I then reinstalled Firefox, but I still got the same error popup (though it at least didn't become unresponsive and crash Windows Explorer any more - but I still have the un-ending processes in Task Manager).
</p><p>By this point I've (after backing them up!) uninstalled Firefox and manually deleted everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Roaming folder, everything Firefox-related in the Appdata/Local folder, and under Program Files (X86), then reinstalled Firefox again. The error persists, unchanged.
</p><p>Any further suggestions on what I could try would be welcome, I'm stumped by this. Chrome and Avast Browser work fine; Internet Explorer works about as well as it ever does. No new programs had been installed around the time of the problem (to my knowledge) and I've been using Firefox for years on this PC.

There is ""Old Firefox Data"" folder on my desktop (although it only seems to be as recent as November 2018). When I try to open bookmarkbackups it gets locked in a loop of asking me if I want to open or save it in Internet Explorer, but never actually opens it.
If I had known I'd have these problems I would never have upgraded or opened a Firefox account!

I tried edge, and it's fine, only FF 68 has the startup problem.  So, uninstalled 68, clean installed 67 to get rid of vpn effect.  Now it upgraded me to 68 and I have no problems with startup.....

I am not sure if this is a Google of a Firefox problem. In this past week there has been a new information frame appear. Before when one clicked on an image it would be highlighted amid the search grid with some associated information (original site, image size etc). Now this pops out as a separate panel to the right of my browser screem. Due to the quick way I need to work, this is cumbersome and annoying.
</p><p>Also if I right clicked and opened an image in a new tab, it would open with the image filling two-thirds of the screen on the left, which gave a decent view of it. On the right hand panel would be the information about site, title, caption etc. Now all of this is squished into a portrait sized panel that looks as though it has been designed for a tablet or phone. It also means with each image I am having to conduct an additional action to right click to expand to full size so I can actually get a decent view of what it is because it has been so squished down to only medium size by all the other data.
</p><p>My question is this. Up until a few days ago this panel was not there. It would occasionally appear sometimes, especially if I was logged into a Google account but mostly not and would be gone next time I searched. From my investigation of this it is something that appears with some browsers and not others. If this is something that does/doesn't appear in Firefox, how do i make it go away?
</p><p>My question is is how do I make this pop-up panel go away and just get the regular old image highlight? Much easier and less messing around to use, not to mention actually offered a better and clearer view of what the image actually was.

I have all the dependecies installed in /home/linuxbrew/.linux and the build setting works previously with firefox 64.0. It seems the build system is looking for dependency in /usr/lib, which contains ancient version of compiler toolchain that can't build firefox. How do I tell the build system to exclude looking into /usr/lib at all?

aktuell ist mir aufgefallen das man im Firefox .lnk Dateien nicht Downloaden kann. Der Download schlägt immer Fehler. Dies wurde bereits mit mehreren Personen und Geräten getestet, allerdings tritt überrall der selbe Fehler auf.
Über einen anderen Browser besteht das Problem nicht, hier kann man ohne Probleme die Dateien Downloaden.
Ich bin verschiedene Lösungsschritte von Mozilla durchgegangen um das Problem zu beheben, allerdings war dies leider ohne Erfolg. 
Profil zurückgesetzt, Firefox neu installiert, Download Ordner geleert, Download Ordner zurückgesetzt, Cookies gelöscht usw.
Kennt vielleicht jemand das Problem ggf. hat jemand einen Tipp wie man das Problem beheben kann?
Über eine Antwort würde ich mich sehr freuen.
LG Alex

Close any application that is using this file, and then try again. You might need to restart the computer.
</p><p>The issue does not present itself if the .PDF file, downloaded via Firefox is opened from the 'File Explorer' download folder. (EG by clicking the corresponding  'folder' icon next to the download, then opening the .PDF file from there or by any other means of accessing the file in question through File Explorer)
</p><p>There are also no issues downloading .PDF files and attaching them in the same manner, using other browsers or their versions of the download manager. (IE, Edge, Chrome)
</p><p>This issue has appeared on two computers tested so far and is repeatable/persistent.
</p><p>I suspect that the message regarding the .OST file is a bit of a red herring. I think the FF downloads library window is somehow locking the PDF opened through it and thus causing an error when attempting to pass the file over to Outlook to send as an attachment.

<pre>Olá, pessoal.

</p><p>Alguém poderia me dar umas dicas sobre estilos de páginas que usam os recursos fontawesome-webfont?
Estou apanhando aqui.
Como as páginas que eu salvo com o Firefox não conseguem baixar esses ícones, eu uso a extensão WebScrapbook.
Só que eu notei que, depois que atualizei o Firefox, o WebScrapbook também não consegue mais baixar os ícones do fontawesome-webfont.
Tentei inspecionar esses ícones e achei alguns códigos que lembram os Emojis.
Um deles é \f08d, como um exemplo.
Eu não estou vendo como exibir na página HTML esses ícones.

1266098,2019-08-04 09:20:27 -0800,2019-08-07T01:27:24Z,Still Not Working!,"<p>I gave up on Firefox due to its insistence that I could not stop it forcing updates on me no matter what settings I used in options as well as about: . I went back to IE9. Yes 9, as Microsoft couldn't repair Windows 7 to get a later version installed. Anyhow, after my motherboard became erratic and the replacement meant Win 7 no longer worked at all, I decided it was time to 'upgrade' to Win 10. After a complete reinstall of my software from scratch I realised just how bad Edge is and thought I might see how Firefox was holding up. I thought the sync could be useful and was getting on with it until 68.0.1!
Since updating to this version automatically (the settings in options still do not work), it appears it is updating/resetting itself after every reboot. It restores the defaults and behaves as if it has just updated each time. Also after doing this for five times it appears to have broken ADBlock which advises it cannot work any more. I have had to uninstall it to get the tab to stop.
So, as my questions were never answered previously, I'll ask again:
1. How do I get Firefox to stop updating itself? Options 'check for updates but let you choose when to install them' clearly still doesn't work as it updates regardless.
2. How do I get to keep my preferences. Having to go through them all each time Firefox updates is a pain. Surely it cannot be too much to create an ini file?
3. How do I convince Firefox not to keep installing version 68.0.1 over itself?
4. As Adblock no longer works in this version (I'm sure they are pleased with this result), what good alternatives are there?

Why is that?,"<p>Four or five months ago, I saw the Content Blocking shield icon in my Firefox browser.  When I clicked on it, there was no option to disable Content Blocking.  Then I realized that I probably had to create a Mozilla account.  Did that, and suddenly the option was there to disable content blocking.  Today I was at the MSN website - which has been crashing my video driver lately, and I thought that perhaps if I shut off content blocking it would help.  Lo and behold there is no more shield icon but there is an information icon which contains content blocking info (it is an i inside a circle).  Once again there is no 'disable content blocking for this site' option.  What gives?  How can I get the shield icon and the disable option back??  I currently use Firefox version 68.0.1 (64 bit)

I have weird issue in Firefox when trying to connect to websocket server on xenserver(xcp-ng to be exact)
it seems firefox for some reason is unable to make the connection 
the error message is very poor as it does not explain the cause why firefox is not able to make the connection. the error message just say ""Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at wss://""
</p><p>I tried to enable logging and check the logs , it was not easy to understand I suspect there is a disconnect but not sure
</p><p>the same code and same site works perfectly in chrome and it works on older Firefox versions but on the latest versions it does not work
</p><p>I dont know when exactly (what version it stopped working) but last tested version that worked is 
</p><p>I have the logs of 2 cases 
first case is full log from our website while i am trying to connect to the websocket from or site
second case is just i opened the site and from console I wrote new WebSocket('wss://...',binary) 
</p><p>will upload it shortly 
</p><p><br>
Thanks
