I would like to ask you for a help with downgrading of the user profile.
I have updated to the latest FF69b2, but it has too much bugs, app freezes, pages are loading exptremely slowly, ajax doesn't work properly.
Therefore I want to go back to the FF68b14, but I can't, FF68b14 says that the profile was already used by a newer version.
The only option is to create a new profile. I would like to try it anyway. 
Do you know where is the version number of the profile stored? I tried to replace all ""68.0"" within prefs.js but it didn't help.
There should be possible to go back to the previous version, or the user has to be informed about irreversible conversion of the profile, which isn't this case I believe.

Why is this? I've tried doing the sessionstore-backups trick but that doesn't work. Unless it can be explained otherwise, this seems to me to be bad update execution, which is a defect. That I have to go to a third-party URL to have it extract my old URLs from my previous session is a workaround to a problem that the team should highly prioritize fixing. This is a good measure of a problem - if someone has developed a website to address a problem, then the application is not sufficiently addressing the problem. Also if the app is going to completely wipe user settings, the user should be notified beforehand.

This is Windows 7 64-Bit, on which Microsoft will stop support.  IE11 is my default, but I use it less often as other browsers.  Anyway, while chatting with Amazon online, a page popped up stating that I needed to download a critical update for Firefox.  The entire screen was blocked so I could not see the tray at the bottom.  A red downward arrow flashed in the left top corner of the screen with the word Download.  My only option was to bring up Task Manager by hitting Ctrl Alt Delete.  Then, upon restarting Firefox I had to make sure it did not open to that page.  I do not know what it was.  For me to revisit the page to get a screenshot is too risky; so please do not request that.  I have a document saved in Notepad, Word and PDF on which I have the address of this bad site; but they will not upload here.  Maybe it would be best to send this location privately as I would not want it to post publicly where others might go to it and do damage to their computer.

</p><p>The Intermediate certificate does not appear to get installed in the Firefox browser when the user first connects to the portal.  We manually imported the Intermediate certificate and the page loads with a valid certificate.  We then go into the options settings and remove the Intermediate certificate, close all open browsers, reload the windows 10 workstation, connect to the portal and the page shows a secure certificate.  When we look in the ""Authorities"" section of Certificate Manger the Intermediate certificate is listed.

</p><p>A few weeks ago I logged into an online account (Strava) and noticed an unfamiliar email in the suggestion box that appears below the email entry box when an email is entered. I ignored it at the time but recently logged into Facebook and saw the same email in the list of remembered login emails. I found the person who owns the unfamiliar email address through my university’s internal lookup service; I have never met the person and I never let anyone access my computer without my knowledge and consent. I am concerned that this person could somehow be accessing my Firefox account and/or other online accounts and the rest of the data on my machine. Is this concern valid given what I’ve noticed? Under what circumstances will Firefox remember an email address so it can be suggested at a later login (ie, does someone have to log in to the particular device being used, or is there another circumstance in which Firefox could remember a login email?) If my concern is valid, what should I do?  Note that I have never had Sync enabled, to my knowledge.
</p><p>System information:
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
Machine: 2017 Lenovo IdeaPad 320 64-bit
Firefox version: Firefox Quantum 67.0.4. I have never had Sync enabled, to my knowledge. 
</p><p>My background: I consider myself basically computer-literate but have very limited knowledge of internet security, Firefox’s inner workings, and how web browsers work in general.

Recently I had to do some cleaning and downloaded a few important MS updates. I am very selective as to what updates I will install.
</p><p>Then my previously stable FF started hanging. For backup I can run Chrome portable but even that wouldn't run. I tried to stop the Firefox.exe service and it would not go away without a reboot. This is a particularly nasty problem and the most offered solution is to stop hardware acceleration, which didn't work for me. Then I discovered parent.lock file in the profile and with an unlock app I could eventually kill FF.
</p><p>I did a clean re-install after searching and finding all those Mozilla files in the system folders and registry entries (why no app to do this?). After a clean re-install with the default profile, the lockup problems would come back. I even tried installing a 32 bit version with the same result.  I eventually solved my problem without a solution anywhere!
</p><p>Go to Windows programs and features, then turn on windows features and despite the warning, I turned off Internet Explorer 11.

I also accept an up to date version of FF may work differently with better security, but I like my old version and the 3rd party addons that aren't compatible with new versions.

</p><p>In the attached image, the left half is *without* the cursor positioned in the search box, and the right half -- which shows the fading -- is *with* the cursor positioned in the search box for typing. 
</p><p>Some points: (1) This does not happen when using Google Search in Chrome or IE. (Firefox is my default browser, BTW.)  (2)  This does not happen on either of my other two Windows 7 pc's, which also use Firefox 60.7.2esr (32-bit).
(3) Disabling add-ons by using Safe Mode doesn't change the behavior.
(4) Disabling Hardware Acceleration doesn't change the behavior.
</p><p>My main concern with this behavior is in case it indicates the possibility of some kind of malware.  My secondary concern is whether it might indicate some other current or potential problem with my system, although I haven't noticed any other issues thus far.  Other than that, I don't mind the behavior, as it doesn't slow me down or prevent me from accomplishing anything.
</p><p>Any suggestions or other thoughts?  (I prefer not to do a reset.)  Thanks.

In my mind Firefox stands for a free Internet. But it seems so fade to ""Firefox stands for a leftist Internet"".
</p><p>We got Pocket and moz://a 3 years ago and it's horrible.
As an official Firefox-Feature I would expect Pocket to be political neutral. 
But (At least here in Germany) from the Big Newspapers you get only to see the ones who are clearly leaning left in Pocket. Never saw a conservative article in Pocket, and I look at it pretty much every day because I am too lazy to remove it from my phone. (Although on my PC I have removed it).
Germany is pretty balanced with about 50% Conservatives and 50% progressives in it's population. Still, Pocket is obviously biased towards the left.
</p><p>Do I have to begin with moz://a ? 
Yeah, some articles are for Internet-Freedoms. Thats totally okay because It is how Firefox works. A FREE Internet.
But not a left one. Still we get Articles like 
<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/change-makers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/change-makers/</a>
(Considering Stuff like Black Lives Matter for your ""Brand Identity"" which is pretty much the same as promoting the klu klux klan.
They are violent, their leaders say in public they want the ""white race eradicated"" etc. I just can't believe you support Extremist groups.)
</p><p>Nothing against casual lefts. But I don't wan't every product I use politized. Neither Right nor Left.
I just want a product doing what it should do.
</p><p><br>
So, As I am not really involved in the background processes of Firefox, please tell me if Firefox now became officially left. Because then I have to search myself a new browser and stop my business donating to it.

However the JSON response, instead of being returned by calling the response handler is instead overlaid on top of the page which made the AJAX request.  I have attached a screenshot displaying this.  The JSON response is encased in &lt;pre&gt;.  I know my code is not doing this because there is no occurrence of that string in my code.  The JSON itself is valid according to JsonLint.  So why is my response handler not being called, and where is this overlay coming from?  I am using the code from JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition, by David Flanagan. Copyright 2006 O'Reilly Media, Inc.  (ISBN: 0596101996) to send the AJAX request, fixed to invoke JSON.parse instead of the JS interpreter to handle the response.  I am running Firefox 67.0.4 on Ubuntu 19.04.
