</p><p>I am running a macOS Catalina v 10.15.1 on a 3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5; 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4.
</p><p>I am NOT having a performance issue.  Instead, the browser is not responding as expected when given tasks.
</p><p>1.  It will not open a link in a new tab.  The tab does not open and it's as if I never clicked on the menu item.  Same with open in new window.
2.  It will not open the default search engine from the URL bar.  Instead, it responds as if I mistyped a URL.
3.  It will not allow me to set a Default Search Engine.  The option to do that in Preferences is a drop-down arrow that does nothing when clicked.
4.  It will not allow me to Remove an add-on.  Usually issues with Firefox are related to add-ons, but when I Remove an add-on, then restart Firefox, the add-on is still there.
5. (silly, minor issue) I'd like the tab bar to be dark, again.  The white tabs are too bright!  I know this is silly, but you asked...
</p><p>I did run Firefox in safe mode and all of the same problems continue to occur.
I did reinstall FF v. 71.0 and all of the same problems continue to occur.

Yes, I clicked on the little ""eye"" next to the password field under Tools.Options.Privacy .. and yes, I tried trusting and just using the stored password both for the UID (it kept the old password) and also for the ""no username"" and neither works.  I can update the password manually when under Tools.Options.Privacy, but I do not have the time nor inclination to do this for hundreds of logins.

However there's not means of archiving, syncing or backup for all your fastidious work configuring your various websites to open within specific containers.

Either is fine as this extension is a more advanced feature, but totally awesome! Thanks.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu)
</p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible. Keep in mind it is already installed. I want to find the page for it at <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> so that I can reinstall it in the future should I need to do a fresh installation.

So, is there some setting somewhere in the about:config where I can control which monitor is default? I can't find an obvious one, at least.
EDIT: I was wrong. It doesn't always open the video on the 1st monitor. It just always opens the video on the monitor to the left of the one the browser is on. :D

On Google Play you can review installed extensions in Play Store easily by click each of them and use the one-tap rating button.
On iOS, if you allow them, App Store will even prompt you a one-tap rater after you've installed some app and used for a while, which is even more convenient.
I wonder if Firefox (could) have the same experience. Without it, it's harder to encourage people (who wish to spare the time) to involve in the rating system.

Now if FF crashes for some reason or there is a power outage, sometimes session restore only works for one profile that is restarted first, while the others lose all the tabs that were open last time. Now I have a feeling that this is much more likely to happen if the browser was recently updated (it happened several times on the first restart after the update).
I reckon that this might have something to do with the session restore only restoring one of the opened windows (which, as I understand, is now fixed).
In each of the profiles the automatic session restore is set on.

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected. 
</p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there.
</p>
<ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install. Stylus also doesn't work, and all my styles have vanished. Tampermonkey worked running a script on Youtube, but once again, on startup, the script was gone.

I tried typing the six numbers with and without space in between and multiple times in two consecutive days, bot nothing seems to work.  I read the QR code succesfully and added Firefox on Authy, but the code just always seems to be incorrect (I'm not sure how to translate it in english, I am using Firefox in Finnish, see the attached image).

1274489,2019-12-06 13:54:52 -0800,2019-12-06T14:59:42Z,Can't Log In to SSA Website,"<p>About six months ago, I posted here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504</a> b/c I was unable to log into the AT&amp;T website.  Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment.
</p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again.
</p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem....
</p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.  And just FYI, the rep also agreed that my ad blockers should not have been an issue.  Reluctantly, I went to MS Edge - I was able to log in.   I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible.
</p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password.""
	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway
	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.'
	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.  However, I do not use the 'saved log ins' feature or use a master password - I get the impression that is what would be affected if I followed the provisions outlined, and so may not apply to my issue.  Right?
</p><p>All that said... does anyone have any idea why I cannot log in to the SSA site using FF?

Any help will be appreciated.,"<p>I have done everything that is in the support answers, but to no avail.  When I open FF in my jalopy (10 yr old computer), all my current bookmarks, and history for the past 5 years are still there.

None of your support answers say anything about whether to copy the jalopy files into the local, or roaming folders, so I copied it into both.  Still no difference.
</p><p>In a related migration/replace problem, I cannot sync my new computer with the old, even though they're both in the same account name.  The jalopy and new computer names are both recognized in the jalopy, but the new computer doesn't pick up the old computer name.   This was the first thing I tried to reconcile the two machines.  I am extremely frustrated, and at my wits end dealing with this problem.  Any reasonable assistance and solutions are appreciated.  Thank you.

This is done with the Task Manager.
However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks.
Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10.
I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes.

Even when I enable the ""offline mode"",  tabs with heavy javascript continue trying to load, consuming CPU resources. I want they to stop immideately. I tried different extensions, but results are unsatisfactory. Does anybody know some trick?
My goal is to find a method to flush all javascript structures in RAM. I explored about:memory, and tried the vmmap.exe (process memory analyzer) from the Sysinternals Suite, but I have not succeeded so far.
Auto unload tab -- is not a solution. For example I clicked on links and opened 30 tabs in background. PC starts working very slow, Now I want to stop all them, and to read the loaded information (webpages). How to do it? I think it is the weakest side of Firefox. Needed to abrupt all attempts to make network connection, after the ""offline mode"" is enabled.
I need something to stop javascript's attempts to connect, to calm it down. I want to start read webpages already loaded, and javascript occupies CPU. To kill threads in the Process Manager is not a way to do at all, Auto-unload also, I want to read those webpages.  I have enough of RAM, it is not used more then a half. 
Many years ago, when there was HTML4, I used for a little the Maxton browser. It had a button to stop all pages. All similiar Firefox extensions do not act effectively like that.
the issue not in scarcity of RAM, but in a badly design of browser's architecture, that javascript occupies users' PCs.

</p><p>I went through various processes to try and resurrect FF, but without success --- FireFox would not run.
</p><p>I eventually resorted to installing Version 65.0 but, despite the update settings being set as above, Version 71 kept installing and making FF a ""non-starter"" again.
</p><p>I made an alteration to the ""about:config"" which seems to have stopped the automatic updating, albeit the ""FF Icon"" still wants to function as ""Updater"" and I get a message (when started) saying FF is unable to update to the latest version - ""click here to download etc.,"" which of course I don't do and FF continues to perform as expected - albeit 65 and not 71.

</p><p>I log out of devices that I do not own when I'm exiting Firefox. Today I opened Firefox on a device that I'm 100% certain I logged out of yesterday - and found that my bookmarks, bookmarks bar, and add-ons were already visible and active, and one of my add-ons was already logged in. 
</p><p>I verified that the Firefox Sync / login screen showed that no one was logged into the Firefox account, and then I logged in using my usual credentials. It reflected that I was then logged in, but everything else remained visible. 
</p><p>I followed Firefox instructions for viewing the logs, and strangely, there was no log. I went up a directory, and found that all the logs were in the 'failed' directory. Clicking on each of the failed subfolders shows only: ids	[]
</p><p>This is very concerning because it entirely negates the security and privacy aspects of having a login. I was not logged into Firefox - and the Firefox interface confirmed that this morning, in addition to confirming it when I logged out yesterday - yet somehow not only were my personal bookmarks showing, but one of my add-ons was also logged in, providing further access to anyone who might have opened a Firefox window from this device.

The other is AnonymoX which I use for general purposes.
</p><p>A few days ago I upgraded to Firefox 71.0 as well as updated my Windows 10 to the latest 1903 version. Today I noticed that both extensions have stopped working. AnonymoX just doesn't work, whereas the other plugin, upon activation, says (translated) ""Conflict detected! Proxy settings are controlled by a different plugin or cannot be set up"" Trying to circumvent a block (and only then - unblocked websites work fine) now either redirects me to the ISPs blocking page, or alternatively produces a ""Secure Connection Failed PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR""  message after a long TLS handshake. Running the same extensions in Chrome does not reproduce the issue - blocked websites become accessible as usual. The issue also persists for three different connections - a public wi-fi network, a private network and a tethered 4G connection, all served by different ISPs. Finally, I am not running any anti-virus software or firewall. Thus this seems to be a Firefox issue and not a system or network issue. 
</p><p>This also doesn't seem to be an issue with the country's blocking system itself because other users around me are still able to circumvent blocks using the same extensions and I am able to circumvent blocks using a similar extension on my Android phone with a local SIM. 
</p><p>Things I've tried so far:
1) Made sure that both Windows and Firefox are set to not use a proxy
</p><p>2) Reinstalled the extensions
</p><p>3) Created a different profile in Firefox. The extensions don't work in the new profile either, although the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR does not appear - I just always get redirected to the respective ISPs block page
</p><p>4) Cleared all cache, cookies, site settings etc.
</p><p>5) Deleted the cert9.db file and let Firefox recereate it
</p><p>So far nothing has worked. I'm frankly at a loss here. I have half a mind to just reinstall Firefox altogether since this is not my main PC and losing bookmarks wouldn't inconvenience me on it, but figured I'd ask here before.

When I go to a site which requires a client certificate it pops up the selector for the client certificate. With Firefox 70 (I think) by default it chose a matching and valid client certificate. Now with Firefox 71 it seems to sort the client certificates by serial number and thus the one selected by default is the first one in the list, which is expired in my case. Thus, now each time I go to a site where I need a client cert I must manually pick the correct, valid certificate.

1274301,2019-12-04 14:02:33 -0800,2019-12-06T17:38:45Z,What caused profiles to torque two days ago?,"<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask the question that comes at the end of this note.  If you scroll to the end, you can see it marked as MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
</p><p>As I was posting the question, I took advantage of the moment to reflect on the fact that FireFox's perseverance over its long history of ups and downs today has made FireFox one of the real hopes for humanity.  Long Live FireFox!
</p><p>Back in the dark ages, before the ascendance of Google's Chrome browser, I learned to recover FireFox's guts, to cope with its gastric spasms of projectile digital vomiting, which seemed to occur every few weeks.  Most software in those days contributed full shares to the unusable stew, made the accumulation of digital barf that needed cleanup as often as I needed to clean up after hangovers from over drinking when I was a stupid youth. Those were the days when running a computer all day without being forced to restart taught me to weild Windows Task Manager as weapon, which usually provided a side step around enough of the binary vomit top cut restarts from 4 a day to only one or two.
</p><p>Years later, while Microsoft was recovering from the largest, most expensive public mistake in software history (Windows 8), Google got a handle on Chrome.  After that, around 2014, Google either found Popeye's spinach factory, or aliens joined them in their Mountain View offices, because no human force can account for the rate and quality of significant upgrades to all their systems since then, for Chrome browser, underlying Chromium technology now used by everyone, not just for browsers, but all manor of application software to run on all kinds of platforms, Android for phones and apps, YouTube video processing that spots copyrighted sound and images in every video that has it, the world-leading advertising systems and dashboards, and their search engine so much better than anyone else's our choice is to use Google Search or be stupid and slow, or use Google Maps or be lost.  Google pumps out new and better software features one hundred times faster than any other organization.  If you missed the media reports explaining this, that is because Google's super productivity has not been celebrated in anything like the degree warranted. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, Google also has become so evil  it probably cannot be prevented from destroying the system of human checks and balances invented in the United States 240 years ago. As simple and feeble as those checks and balances are, without them it is hard to see how any substantial part of the human population ever could have experienced and lived with Liberty and the productivity it makes possible.  For example, without the Liberty growing throughout the world after taking its initial root in the United States and our written Constitution, one of the most ingenious and consequential documents ever written, the normal result of military conflict would have been one murderous, tyrannical, wholly self-serving dictatorship or another forcing 99% of the human population to live as serfs or slaves in the involuntary service of people like you know who.  Google and the rest of the power players in commercial media are destroying that, through political bias they lie about.  The problem with their lies is they have the power of their media platform to perpetrate them.  Google is evil and needs to be neutralized.  The main thing I can do about this is to stop using their products.  The other thing I can do is tell people about what is happening.  I was raised to see things this way, but for until recently, I did not see this is the way we have to look at things because this is the way that works.  Until recently, I did not know society cannot stop functioning, but now I know that the functioning we all take for granted, including the people fighting against it, is rare as diamonds when viewed in the context of human history, Some of the people attacking our country want to break it down, because they want the United States to become like the places people now leave in order to come here.  The sickness is the same that has affected all gluttons for power.  They have learned that force of military arms tends to galvanize people like you and me.  Instead, they lie to us. pretending to harbor the same loves for life you and I have, when in truth they see us is idiot patsies, making us deserve their the damages wrought by their treachery.
</p><p>Therefore, I stopped using Chrome, returning to the FireFox way of browsing.  I was with Chrome so long, I forgot all about recovering browser profiles.  FireFox is a lot more reliable today than it was before Chome blew everybody out of the water, but its profile system still ha regular bouts with projectile digital vomiting.
</p><p>Today, my FireFox is not blasting bile all over the house, but is being rather brave holding the contagion within itself. I noticed passwords not filling into web forms that used to be there. I am not sure of the timing.  I probably was a long time ago, but I kept getting messages from FireFox babbling about their new security system.
</p><p>Today, I needed to identify active profile (i.e., the one I use) from the half dozen profiles piled into my FireFox installation.  I don't know why there is more than one.  Unfortunately, I just could not glean the one I need to look at from their names:
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p>The online guide provided the usual waste of time.  I asked the computer how to know which profile is the active one.  I immediately found thousands of articles which each spell out the same eight or ten reasons why a person might wish to know which profile is active. The people writing these articles know their articles are filled mostly with spam (information we already have or don't need), but their editors are evaluated on word count, needed for diluting the concentration of ads in their publication.  It's been years since the ANSWERS were easy to pick out of spam portions of the articles they appear with.  From this agony-inducing swill I found information that looked like it might tell me how to spot the active profile.  ""Look for "".default"" as part of the profile name.  So I looked again,
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p><br>
All of the profile names contain "".default.""
</p><p><br>
MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
Then I noticed the dates
</p><p>Months ago   b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
Months ago   n34593ht.default-release/
Two days ago   n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
Today  q412vz1p.default/
</p><p>Evidently, two days ago, FireFox ditched my profile and gave me a new one.  This leads to my question, my reason for posting this thread:
</p><p>Why?
</p><p>In other words, 
</p><p>Why did FireFox ditch my profile and give me a new two days ago?
</p><p>I understand, you probably don't know why in my particular case.  I am hoping for reasonable guesses or possibilities.

Except for Firefox. No matter which page, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Twitter... no sound for videos. Firefox is quiet. If I check my sound settings, the bar for sound input is not even moving, seems like Firefox is just not recognising or forwarding any sound to my USB G560 speakers.
</p><p>On the other hand, everything works in Google Chrome and sound is brilliant. The problem just seems to be with Firefox. I disabled all audio devices, especially my old audio-out where I had my old speakers. I updated the drivers for Realtek HD Audio (even though I am sure I do not need them for the G560) and also updated again driver for the G560 as well as the Logitech G Hub. Firefox is also the latest version.
</p><p>But nothing. Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560.
</p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices. Re-Installing the G560 drivers does not change anything.
</p><p>So if I wanna have any sound in Firefox I am depending on the error message popping up... which happens only rarely. But that can't be the solution :( It seems to me the problem is with Firefox, in the way it handles the sound channel or content or whatever... and does not recognize my G560 via USB as speaker system. Even though it is the only one set active in my system.

This is with multiple types of Logitech webcams. I've tried to disable all security settings, disable hardware acceleration but none of this works. The webcams worked fine in lower builds. All is fine in Google Chome. Webcam works immediately so this issue is definitely a Firefox problem. I've tried multiple machines all loaded with Windows 10 or Windows Server 2012 R2 and no plugins.

How is that possible??? How is youtube actually removing my local browser history? Is that what theyre doing or are they somehow manipulating my browser to think there is none?

</p><p>I use Firefox across my devices (after 5 years of Google Chrome and other Google services). I found one missing piece on the Firefox product in general. It doesn't sync my settings when I log into the new device. The settings I'm talking about are Search Engine and Notification, although I think this can be applied to any other settings that I'm not using or aware of.
Long story short, since I quit using Google Chrome (although I can't quit using Android, I still disable Google services and provide with least of permissions to any services on the mobile device) I switched back to Mozilla Firefox browser and using in on all my devices (Windows, couple of Linux Desktops as well as Android) and I found that when I login to my Firefox account I still have to change Search Engine from Google to DuckDuckGo and I wonder why Extensions are being installed and synced while search engines are not. Also same thing for Notifications. I don't like being notified and disable all kind of notifications for all Web Sites (no exclusions).  Can you please include these pieces to sync when login to the account or have a checkbox in case if some users want to keep different settings on different devices etc...?

</p><p>I just got a new Windows 10 computer (Dell Inspiron 15 15000) and transferred all my stuff including firefox with all the tabs I had open.
</p><p>I usually have lots of tabs open, and I opened all the tabs on my new computer that I had had on the old one.  For some reason I can't recall, I ended up with one window with one tab, and one window with all the tabs I'd had open on my old machine (including the one that was open by itself in the other window).  I closed the window with the single tab, and continued using the window with many tabs.  At the end of the day, I closed the window as usual and shut down the computer.
</p><p>The next day, I turned on my computer, opened up firefox, and no tabs!  I checked to make sure that ""open previous session at startup"" was checked in the main settings, did some searching through the help files here, and found that the problem was that I hadn't gone in to the privacy settings to tell it to remember history.  I fixed that, and did some more digging to figure out how to restore history, I don't remember how.  I restarted Firefox, and it restored a previous session ... but not the one I wanted.  It restored the window with the single tab that I'd only had open for about ten minutes, not the window with all my tabs (including that one) that I'd had open all day.  Some more searching through the support here and I figured out how to restore the session I ACTUALLY wanted.  I can't find the post now, but it told me to go to Help - Troubleshooting Information (I think--it LOOKED like the Troubleshooting Information page, from what I remember, although today it doesn't seem to have the option I used yesterday, so it might have been a different page) and see if there were two sessions, and if so, to click the other one, and see if that fixed things.  It did!  I got the window with all the tabs back, and closed the window with just the single tab, and went on with my day.  Problem solved, right?
</p><p>No.  I booted up my computer today, opened up Firefox, and what did I find?  IT OPENED THE WINDOW WITH THE SINGLE TAB THAT I'D ONLY HAD OPEN BRIEFLY, INSTEAD OF THE WINDOW WITH ALL MY TABS IN IT THAT I'D HAD OPEN ALL DAY.  First of all, I'd rather not have to deal with this again, so how can I make sure it doesn't?  What is going on?
</p><p>Second, I can't find the help page that told me how to restore the correct window.  This is a problem, because although all of the tabs I had open yesterday are in my history, when I go to the little library icon and look at ""history"" both the ""recently closed windows"" and ""recently closed tabs"" are empty.  As far as Firefox is concerned, I haven't closed any windows or tabs since the last time the history was deleted, despite having lots of pages in the Recent History list that I sure don't have open right now.  Clicking the three horizontal lines to get the main menu, there is no ""restore previous session"" as an option.  I can go through the history and manually click on all the tabs that should be open, but that is REALLY a pain and I would like not to have to do this again.  I have added the ""Tab Session Manager"" addon, so hopefully even if this is a recurring problem I can use that to get around it.  (The addons listed below are all the addons I had when the problem occurred.)  What the heck is going on here?

I've had the  issue for about a month. I've found it incredibly handy to open the download folder from the drop down menu of the download icon. And that option is not available if the the download fails. Instead, a repeat download icon is displayed. So, I've had to comply and re-start the download every time. 
</p><p>Wondering if the first download was indeed faulty, I navigated to the download folder using Explorer and found the page replicated just fine. But it turns out that the second download screws up my fonts and formatting. This I did not know until today.
</p><p>To see if I could figure out the difference between the first download and the repeat thereof, I created two folders, 'first' and 'second' as sub-folders to the download folder. Because I would overwrite the files with the repeat download, I preserved the first download by moving those files into the first folder. The first folder now contained a .htm file and a files sub-folder. The original download location was empty. I then repeated the download, and found but a single .htm file was downloaded. 
</p><p>When I open the single .htm file, the fonts are messed up as well as the formatting. So, thinking that the second download needed it's _files directory, I copied that back, and sure enough everything looked good again. I also compared the first .htm file with the second, and they are identical.
</p><p>My next test was to copy (not move) the _files folder to preserve it, between the first and second download, then compare them. There are differences! There's an extra .htm file in the first download, that's missing in the second. There's an extra .xht file in the second download that is missing in the first. There's a zero length file in each download with unique names, not in the other: mark1_data exists in the first download; a_data in the second. I assumed that zero length files would be fruitless to test further.
</p><p>I next tried to add the missing .htm file from the first download into the second _files folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting. I also removed the extra file from the second folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting either.
</p><p>I'll attach the difference listing between the _files folders. The left side has red highlighting and is against the first _files folder and identifies files present there, but not in the second. The right side has green highlighting and is against the second _files folder and shows files present that are not in the first. I'll also attach a sample of good fonts/formatting from the first download, and bad fonts/formatting from the second.

The feature is color customizing (I'm distractable and glare-sensitive so white text on a gray is a big deal to me). 
But the one aspect which i hate, because I'm a green, is its power use. And don't tell me it's due to add-ons, because i've disabled all my addons and it still happens, and it happens when i just start up so it's not build up.  
This spike to 25% (always 25%!) has happened to me over multiple versions for years- it's a built-in FireFox bug, so please please please don't blame it on others. Just FIX IT!
I use FireFox as little as possible and the second some other maker adds white text, i'll ditch Firefox.  Because Mozilla, like all institutions suffers from NIH.  (Not Invented Here.)

Chrome has this very convenient feature that keeps a history item from opening on top of your current page - often you want to compare or add what you saw in history to what you're seeing on the current page without making the current page disappear and having to backpage, thus losing the history page you want displayed at the same time. This seems like an easy enough feature to include that FF is ignoring, like it ignores the longtime request that Firefox enable cut &amp; paste to retain website formatting and functions when pasting into an email (and screenshots don't retain functions like links). If there are enough inconveniences to using FF, people use another browser, and if Chrome and Safari can include such conveniences, so can Firefox.

Obviously this looked fishy to me and I didn't click; instead I killed Firefox via the command line and then restarted it.  When I did, one of my windows didn't look right (I had two windows open, each with several tabs)-- the tab bar at the top just cut off halfway through one of the tabs instead of me being able to scroll over.  In addition, right after I was playing a game on my computer and part of the game board froze.  Now everything seems normal.  Is it possible I managed to end up with some malware even though I didn't click on the link?  Has anyone seen this particular scam before?

Choosing Custom, and deselecting all check boxes doesn't work.","<p>ETP breaks or interferes with just about every site I frequent. I have tried using the ""custom"" option and deselecting the 4 tracker options but every site still has ETP enabled, and it is far too time consuming to have to manually turn it off for every website I visit. I would like to find out 1) what I'm doing wrong that the method I've tried to disable ETP isn't working (yes, I reload the page every time), and 2) is there an ""about:config"" tweak that will turn off ETP globally, as in across the web, and on every new FF session I start? I really don't care who tracks me, but I do care about a feature that makes browsing more tedious and painful. I am using Chrome and Opera in the interim between discovering this annoying ""enhancement"" and when the FF developers fix it so it can be disabled with one click on a more global and permanent basis. Chrome and Opera don't break websites by default.

Problem is when I'm downloading something with Firefox the progress bar on Firefox icon (in the MacOS dock) is too dark and you can't see clearly how much progress downloading something is made.
Can this be changed my user or can I request that Firefox fixes colors so they be more bright?

I recently noticed that decoding youtube videos in 2160p60fps is choppy beyond recognition.
</p><p>Diagnose:
While playing said videos in firefox i was able to observe in the task manager that actually none of my graphics cards video decoding capabilities were used. At lower video qualities/resolutions the hardware accelerated video decoding of the graphics card was also not kicking in, but in these cases my cpu was still able to cope with the decoding load, so I never noticed the missing hardware acceleration.  To narrow the origin of problem down I tried watching the same videos in edge, chrome and even downloaded a short 2160p60fps clip to play with VLC and everything worked fine, just not in my favorite browser firefox :(
</p><p>What i already did trying to solve the problem (in order):
-Restart Firefox without addons
-Refresh Firefox
-Create a new Profile
</p><p>Additional Info:
Nvidia Driver Version 441.20
</p><p>If there is anymore useful info I'm more than happy to provide it.

""Disappears"" = turns white (despite background or other colors) and becomes non-actionable (screen shot attached).
Possible connection: it most often happens during or after using the horrible Blackboard program (web-based version) for my online classes. However, I have seen it happen when Blackboard was not currently in use, and once it happened after a reboot when Blackboard had not been used at all that session.
If I have multiple browser windows open (which is rare--I use tabs), they are all affected at the same time.
If I close Firefox and open it in a new window, the problem exists on the new window too.
When it happens, the only recourse is to reboot my computer entirely.
Aside from changing the auto-download location, I have not customized Firefox and have not installed any plugins. (Some may have been installed automatically such as those for Microsoft Office.)

Cuando quería entrar a facebook, me aparecían guardadas otras cuentas de 2 personas que no conozco,a una de ellas se podía entrar, pues su contraseña estaba guardada.
Cuando quise entrar a cuentas de google, y buscar alguna de mis cuentas, encontré que hay otra cuenta desconocida que tampo es mía, a esa no pude entrar.
La verdad no entiendo como esas cuentas pudiero quedar registradas en mi cuenta de firefox sync. lo unico que s eme ocurre, es que el firefox sync este fallando y enlazando cuentas que no son.
o que algun complemento de firefox hubiera vulnerado esa seguridad.

I had this turned off in the about:config Firefox never asked me to update after i clicked false.
I do not want to update i tried the updated version of Firefox and it was horribly slow a lot of the features are removed.
Si i uninstalled it the same day i tried the new version.
I am currently using Firefox 69.0.2 It wants me to upgrade to 70.0.1
Firefox shows me this pop-up every 15 minutes.
</p><p>After i reinstalled Firefox 69.0.2 i started getting the aggravating update pop-up
I forgot how i disabled it the first time. i do know it was in about:config its well hidden
</p><p>I need to get that opo-up shut off again. if i can't get it shut off then, I'll have no choice but to leave Firefox
I have been using Firefox non-stop for around 17 years
I would like to keep using Firefox but, without the annoying update pop-up in my face every 15 minutes.

</p><p>Since a few months ago, Firefox started syncing add-on settings without giving you the option to opt out of it. I'm not talking about syncing the add-ons themselves which is a great thing and also the user can turn it off. I'm talking about add-on settings, syncing of which can be problematic. For example, I have a few website blocker add-ons. I have given these add-ons a list of websites to block on my older son's computer, while I have given them a different list to block on my younger son's computer. This is not viable anymore because Firefox syncs all their settings without asking me. The other problem is that even the disable/enable option of these add-ons are synced, which means that if I have these website blockers enabled on my sons' computers, they are also enabled on my own computer. Consequently, if I disable them on my own computer, they will be disabled on my sons' computers. This is a major issue. I have previously contacted Firefox about this, but I assume it has been lost in the large number feedback that they receive.
</p><p>The blocker add-on was just an example, so please don't offer me solutions for that one add-on. This needs to be fixed for all add-ons.
</p><p>Thank you for reading.

This worked fine. We now have a working profile each, and the original default profile as a backup.
So each of us opens our new Firefox profile and wants to delete the bookmarks that are not ours. We delete the folder.

</p><p>This, happily, changed with lockwise (which also solved some problems on my android devices). I was amazed with the fact that the credentials window opened very fast.
</p><p>Now I'd normally be very happy with this change. However, I noticed that lockwise in firefox (windows) displays the number of logins/passwords at the upper left. It showed <strong>999</strong>... Which is an extremely round number. Coupled with the fact that it opens very fast now, I'm afraid that some change might have occured leading to credentials loss!
</p><p>Are you aware if a credential limit exists <strong>now</strong> on firefox regarding credential management, or whether a credential loss/data loss has been reported on the sync cloud?
</p><p>This is *hugely* important for me, stability of this feature would be enough for me to switch to another browser.
</p><p>I think I have a number of rolling backups on one of my sync-connected Windows PC. When were the new lockwise-related changes introduced? Asking here, in order to check a backup older than that.

""SFCU"" is the only financial institution that ever said (or cared??) my Fx was out of date.
They let me log in after clicking, ""I understand the risks - continue.""
</p><p>They didn't say which old version they detected, but warned of possible security issues.  
I doubt there are any, but I have no way of knowing what stupid things their site maintainers / code may do if they detect a  really old browser.
</p><p>I've read there are other ways to sniff the browser than a few ""general.useragent..."" prefs, but I'm no expert.  Doubt they are, either.
</p><p>They must use a contract vendor to run the site.  It's been &gt;&gt; a month since 1st asked them to tell me what they use to sniff the browser, because it was up to date &amp; ""general.useragent.override"" reflected that.  Generally, their IT dept isn't very helpful.  I had to call them to tell them to upgrade OpenSSL when the big bug surfaced while back, after ~ 90% of financial institutions had upgraded.  They knew nothing of it.  Still waiting for a ""thanks for your help."" 
</p><p>For grins, I entered a science fiction blended UA string just to see what their system would say:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)  Gecko/20100101 Chrome/74.0.3729.169.
Obviously, Chrome doesn't use Gecko engine.
</p><p>So their site didn't complain about outdated browser or screwy UA string.  Their site displayed the same as always.  I purposely mixed &amp; matched the string.  In fact, I didn't change the UA string back to a valid one yet &amp; this site is displaying OK.
</p><p>One issue in using any browser in LInux (as useragent string)  is a very small pool of users, increasing fingerprint ability.
If I found out that most sites (if using desktops) work fine, even if you spoof the OS AND browser, there'd be a much larger group of Windows 10 / Chrome users vs. Linux / Fx users.

If I click that circle arrow thingy - after seeing the files had downloaded - it will tell me the download is complete, but the files will have disappeared!

</p><p>I'm still using an older version of firefox to keep essential add-ons that Quantum no longer had.  I'm having problems on a windows 7 computer with the version I have on it, and would like advice on the best way to proceed.  
</p><p>I had copied over my profile from a different computer where I'd been using FF55.  I'd had some problems with 55, so I installed 52 on this computer, but using that profile.  It's not working very well as I can't get vertical tabs or vertical tabs reloaded to work, it's also crashing fairly often for no apparent reason, etc.  Now even the ""+"" symbol to add a new tab has disappeared from the tab bar, and I don't have a clue why or how to get it back!).  For what it's worth, this isn't a malware/virus problem - I'm running McAfee and also periodically malwarebytes etc., and scans aren't finding problems. Computer has been restarted several times and so on, and I'm still having the problems.  Could this be because the profile was from a firefox 55 version and it's being used on a FF52 version? Or would that not cause this sort of problem?
</p><p>I don't want to go to 56 because I gather it won't be able to access my older saved sessions (I use Session Manager and those are the sessions I'm concerned about - so if this is NOT a problem, please let me know).  I'm concerned about this because wiki says:  ""...Another change was the introduction of the mozlz4 format, a proprietary variant of the lz4 compression format (.mozlz4 and .jsonlz4 file extensions instead of .json.lz4 as per unix/linux standard). Session data is stored in the lz4 format instead of plain text. Firefox 56 can not recognize the legacy plain text session files, only the lz4-encoded ones....""
</p><p>So I'm wondering if I should go to 55 on this computer, or 52ESR?  I gather the ESR would have better security - but want to know if there's a difference in add-on compatibility or other features since 52ESR is, I gather, based on older code than 55?
</p><p>If someone could talk me thru the pros and cons of using 55 versus 52ESR I'd sure appreciate it!!!
</p><p>Also, I would be VERY grateful if folks could point me towards:
1. a reasonably safe site where we can search and install legacy add-ons
2. any webpage which has a good information showing which legacy add-ons now have reasonable replacements in the current FF version.

I noticed this issue quite a few times: When I open the cookies privacy settings, the two buttons ""Clear Data"" and ""Manage Data"" often appear grayed out.
I don't use private browsing or disabled offline cache like I saw in other threads, and I use only 4 regular extensions.
The funny thing is that the buttons become functional on their own after a couple of minutes if I just leave the tab open.
So it seems that Firefox is running some very long process before enabling these buttons the first time the settings page is opened.
If I close the privacy settings tab and open it again, then these two buttons immediately appear enabled, not grayed out.
</p><p>Firefox should probably change the very confusing and counter-intuitive way it is handling these two buttons, or at least display some animated icon to indicate it is doing some stuff, but if it's reading all cookies before deciding to enable the two buttons (and I don't think I have an unusual number of cookies), I'd rather have Firefox enable these buttons immediately and run this cookies analysis process AFTER I click on one of these two buttons, not before.
By the way, it would be great if the about:support page could provide the number of cookies or web sites with cookies so we might use this for technical support. I have no idea how many I have and if this number is a problem.
</p><p>In any case, for all other users that experience the grayed out cookie management buttons: Leave the settings tab open, do other stuff on Firefox or the computer, and come back to this settings tab after a few minutes, you'll find the two buttons enabled.

However, no matter what I do, whenever I open a new private window in this state, it defaults to being just slightly less than full height and I have to manually pull it down every single time. If I shorten the window, it opens to the shorter height, but if I lengthen it again, new windows revert to not-quite-full height.
</p><p>Also, when I first open Firefox after changing the size thus, it sometimes defaults to full height (though Private windows still never do) and sometimes opens to full height, but shifted up slightly so the bottom doesn't quite reach the taskbar and the top extends slightly past the top of the screen.
</p><p>I have no idea what could possibly be causing this - I have tried refreshing Firefox and I've tried deleting xulstore.json, both of which accomplished precisely nothing, so I'd appreciate any help on this.

</p><p>Back in 2015, Mozilla destroyed the search bar by removing the text labels, making it almost impossible to search because you can't find the engine you want. They also removed the ability to switch engines, meaning you have to nominate your engine every single time you search.
</p><p>On top of this, Mozilla reversed the order you do things: It used to be that first you chose the type of content you wanted, then you thought about your exact query. But now, you first have to specify your exact query and THEN think about the type of content you want to search for, which is totally counter-intuitive and terrible interface design. It's like being asked for the name of the meal, movie or book you want, before you've even decided whether you want a meal, movie or book!
</p><p>The reason Mozilla gave for these awful changes was to ""make searching faster"", but that simply is not the case. The new search bar requires just as many clicks, yet it's drastically slower to use as it's almost impossible to find the engine you're looking for from all the unlabeled engines. Plus, having to type your query first is completely counterintuitive to the user's thought process and slows things down even further.
</p><p>Solution:
</p><p>For a couple of years, Classic Theme Restorer was the perfect solution, bringing back the old bar exactly as it should be. However, since Firefox Quantum, Classic Theme Restorer doesn't work, so I've been using Jefferson Scher's excellent userchrome script. (Thank you Mr Scher!)
</p><p>Sadly, with Firefox 70, the script seems to be broken again and many of the engines are missing from the list. I've tried taking the script directly from Jefferson Scher's website, but doing so just makes text labels disappear. It just seems to be broken again.

This is odd because have been I using FF as my main browser for a while now - I would expect consistent backing up every day.
So why are the backups so unreliable? Is there anything I can do to make sure FF backs up every day (like it is supposed to!) ? My FF installs are kept up to date.

""Using an older version of Firefox can corrupt bookmarks and browsing history already saved to an existing Firefox profile. To protect your information, create a new profile for this installation of Firefox.""
Because I am forced to create a new profile I can´t access the original profile with the certificate I need. 
I tried going to about:profiles and setting as default to no avail several times.
I have tried the firefox.exe -P command as well. 
I can´t import the cert9.db file to the certificates setting. I also tried moving the cert9 file to another profile while Firefox is closed but I because I must create a new profile when I open it again and can´t switch profiles once its open it doesn´t make a difference. I´m running out of ideas and it was such a hassle to get the certificate in the first place I can´t afford to lose it. 
Is there another way around creating a new profile? Or anything I´m not considering? 
Thanks

</p><p>I have FF 68.2.0ESR 32bit on Win7. I now want to move to a different machine, using Linux (RHEL8) with FF 68.1.0 ESR 64Bit. 
I transferred the profile from the Windows machine to the Linux machine and everything came over perfectly. But the passwords are not offered after selecting a login.
Example: There is a page with ""login"" and ""password"". I have two accounts for this page. I click into ""login"" and both login-names are offered by firefox. I select one account. Now I'd expect that the password is filled automatically. But it isn't. Even if I click also into the ""password"" field. The same with pages where I have only one account.
</p><p>I found some threads where key3.db is mentioned. I searched in my profile folder and didn't find a key3.db but a key4.db. I created a copy of key4.db and named it key3.db. No success. 
The permissions of the files where 600 (rw-------). Ich changed them to 644. -&gt; No success.

</p><p>Finally decided to make a topic about it as all of my attempts in the past few months to fix it have been in vain.
Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally.
</p><p>I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed.
</p><p>The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it.
</p><p>(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text)
</p><p>From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates.
</p><p>Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here?
</p><p>Thanks in advance,
Rasmus

I typed in Firefox and you are NOT in their list of supported applications.  Facebook, Twitter, Chrome, etc. are all there.  Moreover, I could NOT add Firefox as one of their supported applications.

Did it EVER occur to the Firefox Developers that maybe before you throw up a list of Authenticator Apps that support FireFox, that you first determine if they actually do????????

Sometimes some of them are gone entirely.  It's like they are dying.  Many of them are pretty old, maybe 30 years or so, but I don't want to loose them.  Thanks in advance for any help.

</p><p>Hi there,
</p><p>Thanks for writing in! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble.
</p><p>I believe this is an issue of your browser blocking multiple download from the same site. I have attempted the bulk downloader myself on Chrome and had success with the bundle you mentioned, so that is the only factor I believe may be holding you back. There is an article regarding this issue for the Firefox browser here:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075</a>
</p><p>Installing that add-on may help you correctly download the products in question.
</p><p>If you continue having trouble, let me know and I can discuss this issue with my team further. We may not be able to provide an immediate solution, but we can hopefully address this issue in future updates to this feature.
</p><p>Kind regards,
</p><p>-Finn

So I re-add via YUM the latest Flash plugin, but alas 68.1 still thinks that and IcedTea are INVALID.
</p><p>Mumble. Well let me get the big hammer and further downgrade to FF 60.9, remove pluginreg.dat, fire FF up again and... oh. Still INVALID. Now I'm 100% sure there's something weird - but what is it?
</p><p>Long story short, even creating an entirely new UNIX user and firing up FF which obviously created a new profile from scratch, it gets the same pluginreg.dat right off the bat with Flash and IcedTea plugins marked as INVALID.

</p><p>I am using Firefox 70.0.1 on Win 10.
Audio is fine in general.
However, when I try to skip ahead in a video (YouTube, e.g.), I can hear a very small but audible ""pop"" sound from my headphone, which is super annoying.
My UNEDUCATED guess is my headphone seems to turn off instantly when the video starts buffering, and then turn back on again when buffering is done.
Any idea I can deal with this issue?
</p><p>Thanks in advance.
</p><p>I am using a bluetooth headphone.
I have tested Edge, Opera, and Chrome.
Edge is behaving the same way as Firefox does.
Chrome and Opera is fine without that ""pop"" sound when skipping video ahead.

With Javascript, I change divs, tables, &amp;c., from display:none to, e.g., display:block.  All the attributes work EXCEPT the background image.  So, for example, if background color is #000000, the background shows solid black, and if I change that ahead of time or even on the fly to, e.g., #FF0000, the background changes onclick to solid red.  But, the background image appears pretty much at random as the computer pleases.  So, for example, the background-image is set by css for a table where display:none is the setting.  The template changes the table to display:inline-block.  The table appears, the background color appears, but often no background image appears UNLESS I open the console and uncheck, then recheck some property, e.g., height, associated with the background image.  If, however, I set the initial table property to, e.g., display:inline, the initial result shows a bunch of garbage, but once the display is switched to inline-block, all the background images appear normally and regularly.  This appears to be some kind of bug with Firefox, but for the life of me, I cannot fix it.  If the display of an element -- article, div, table -- starts in the css as ""none,"" the background image often does not appear when display is switched on.

Of course, there's always some kinks along the way.  This time, all of a sudden, Firefox is highlighting selected text in blue.  This ONLY happens on Firefox.  The default system text highlight is YELLOW.  In all other apps, selected text is highlighted in yellow.  I have played w/ the Colors setting on Preferences, setting it to use system colors as default.  No difference.  Interestingly, ON THE PREFERENCES PAGE, text highlights in yellow.  However, on any other website, it highlights in blue.  Obviously this is very, very small.  But it's driving me crazy.

Of course ESR has no problem in whatsover other page, just in the login page.
Final step was to see if th the FF/sync was working in the new mac and then the number of connected devices to this account: the message I got is that ESR associated but the last time it was active was one month ago. Meaning that ESR lost the ability to sync (w/o any alert) one month ago.
