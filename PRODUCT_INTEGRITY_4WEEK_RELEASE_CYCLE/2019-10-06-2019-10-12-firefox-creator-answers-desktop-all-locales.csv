Doing some clean up I removed an exception for <a href=""https://www.diki.pl/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.diki.pl/</a> to autoplay sounds (e.g. <a href=""https://www.diki.pl/dog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.diki.pl/dog</a> ). I expected to have a an ability to add it again when entered on the website and clicked the (i) icon with Permissions as described in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay</a> . However, for that site I don't see anything special (the screenshot attached).
The aforementioned site has the ""Add sites to your list to autoplay media"", but it doesn't allow to add pages, only to remove them or change the settings.
</p><p>After some digging I was able to restore an exception by adding the following row in the moz_perms table in permissions.sqlite:
insert into moz_perms values(XXX, '<a href=""https://www.diki.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.diki.pl</a>', 'autoplay-media', 1, 0, 0, 1570918391133);
</p><p>However, I would expect to have an easier way to do that - I tested it with a clean profile and the effect is the same - just media.autoplay.block-webaudio needs to be set to true to block it at all).
</p><p>Is there any easier way to (re-)enable autoplay for shy website (here using Web Audio API)?

Firefox is the only browser that ships by default with this behavior turned off. It has to be manually enabled via about:config. Why is this? Why not just by default be consistent with all the other major browsers. In Photoshop, the new quick-save to RGB doesn’t allow embedding. But by Firefox conforming to what the other browsers do, at least we can see images consistently across the web. Please make this happen. What an easy thing to address/fix just be toggling the default setting.

It automatically installed a new profile (without any question!).

So I had to search for a solution and was able to switch to the old profile.

The export to a json- or a html-file is not possible. No error is shown! Simply no file is saved when I click on the save-button!
</p><p>Also a downgrade to version 68 didn't bring a solution, because there I was not able to switch to my default-profile. The error message was shown, that the profile could be ruined, if it was already updated to the new version 69 and used there.
</p><p>Because of the update I was forced to register to Firefox Sync and to uplad all my data there. I did never want to upload my bookmarks, passwords and addons somewhere to the internet.
</p><p>I'm really frustrated by this update (after so many years of being a satisfied firefox user) and am thinking about an alternative browser.
</p><p>I hope somebody can help me to not lose all my data.

If the Shockwave Flash plugin is enabled and running something in another tab, that crashes too.
</p><p>Most videos seem fine, but when one causes the issue, it causes it consistently.

</p><p>The issue happens when manually starting that video, or when scrolling down until the bottom of the firefox window reaches the bottom of its preview area (which I assume normally triggers it to play?). This only happens on Firefox. In Opera, it plays as soon as the page is open and scrolling past it causes no issue.
</p><p>Testing once with the Windows 10 Task Manager opened while triggering the issue, some error report briefly flashed at the top of the process list, and it seemed as if the whole Windows UI flashed as well (after that the screen had become brighter and more blue, which I first attributed to some reduced colors mode, but more likely was brightness being reset to a higher setting and perhaps a previously enabled ""Night light"" mode getting turned off at the same time).
</p><p><br>
I first noticed the issue sometime last month in the week following both the Windows 10 mass forced upgrade to 1903 and a Firefox update (making it hard to tell if either caused it, and the grace period to roll back that Windows update is over anyway). Before that the issue never happened.
</p><p>NVidia graphics driver has already been updated.
Already tested with all add-ons disabled, and with plugins disabled (including flash). The most effect that had was getting to scroll past the bottom of that video without it starting, but even that wasn't consistent, and in any case trying to start the video would still trigger the issue.

'Address bar autocomplete in Firefox - Search your bookmarks, history, and tabs' ; that is; (a) in Privacy&amp;Security panel delete the checkmarks in all 3 boxes under Address Bar; b) in Search panel click the 'search suggestions' link to get to the Search settings panel; c) delete the checkmark next to 'Provide search suggestions' to disable them.
I also changed the keyword:enable setting to 'false' as instructed in the helpful Forum answer(s) shown in the attached link.
I do not want anything I type in the address bar going to any search engine -  regardless of how insignificant it may be.  The default behavior of involving a search engine in my browsing seems contrary to Firefox privacy ethos.
Also, prior to a few Firefox updates ago (66?) I set the Address bar to not auto-complete and it worked as expected.

When using other browser such Microsoft edge, chrome and internet explorer, when there's a popup window, it is scrollable but in Mozilla I found out that it is not scrollable, and as a result, I can’t preview what I want to print or decide on it.
When I entered about:config on the address bar and accepted a warning message then I searched for; dom.disable_window_open_feature.scrollbars to see if I can change its value to true but unfortunately my Mozilla doesn’t have; dom.disable_window_open_feature.scrollbars
What my Mozilla has are:
dom.disable_window_open_feature.close;false
dom.disable_window_open_feature.location;true

Our company legal name is with quotation marks so the SSL provider is unable to issue the certificate without them. Certificate installation went smoothly, but after new certificate isntallation our customers noticed that with mozzila firefox browsers ( ONLY, with all others everything is fine )  there are an extra stripes being added to the company name. ( See picture attached ). I have contacted our SSL provider and they told me that they can not do anything in this case, because it is a Mozzila bug, that provider is unable to fix. Any ideas in this case guys, how could we solve that?

I know that the entire cache could just be deleted using ""Clear Recent History"". But that is not a well-planned option.
Some input strings could have as well been simple typos or ill-formed strings. They could in fact be distractions or eyesores. So why not be allowed an option to edit the cached strings? I always do this for my .bash-history file to keep it compact and useful.
So I figure there could be a file in firefox to do just that.
Well, for a personal computer dedicated to a single user, this could be a good option.

1270322,2019-10-09 08:05:57 -0800,2019-11-04T08:51:13Z,Disabling Autoplay:  Why is this such a dismal failure?,"<p>First of all, there are so many articles on this site and others that don't update reflecting the huge changes recently in Autoplay options.  So many settings from the past don't work or aren't even there anymore.  Why are these pages not updated?  Who even uses old version of this browser?  99% of the info online is irrelevant because of this sloppiness.  Just go to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a> and see if anything works.  Good luck with that.  
I did find one extension that did work (so far):  Disable HTML5 Autoplay
But we shouldn't need an extension to do something so basic, so intrinsic to web browsing.  We all know distractions impeded our ability to get things done and cost billions every day as people's productivity sharply drops.  There is nothing more distracting than a video!  So its the number one thing to control.  As long as you're over about 4 years old of course.  Under that and we're fascinated by unfamiliar shiny objects.  
</p><p>So I'm curious about all the autoplay options I have in about:config and if any of these settings matter anymore, now that I have an extension that does what Firefox seems incapable of doing.  When I search for autoplay, this is what I get, sorted alphabetically.  I noticed that some are in bold.  Why is that?  And why is Mozilla so out of touch with us that they can't explain what each of these things actually does?  I wonder if they even know.  You should be able to hover your mouse cursor over an item and a popup should tell you what it does.  Is that so difficult?  Guess so.

I need your help. We have multiple clients connecting thru a corporate VPN and they are having issues with Firefox: When they try to access a website they are experiencing a timeout with “Performing a TLS Handshake to…”.  This only happens on the initial launch of Firefox. A refresh (F5) or reload immediately opens the website after the timeout. As long as the browser stays open, they do not have anymore issues accessing websites. If the browser is closed and re-opened, the issue reappears for the first website requested. This happens for every user connected via VPN. 
No issues whatsoever when they are directly connected to the network (office).
After some troubleshooting, I noticed that the issue appeared from version 67.0. All previous versions do not have the TLS Handshake issue. We are currently using Version 69.0.1. Redoing profiles did not resolve the issue. VPN Users that are having the issue are on Windows 10 while Windows 7 users do not the problem. Also of note, if the client opens Firefox and leaves it idling for 40 sec. (or more) before requesting a https website, they do not get a TLS Handshake timeout.
No issues in IE11, Edge or Chrome while connected thru VPN.
</p><p>Ideas?

I make a bookmark and it doesn't show up on the other machine, not on addition, not after a day, not until I manually hit Sync now on BOTH machines. I don't think it's working as designed...
</p><p>So my question is, how does sync actually work, if it's neither a scheduled nor a push sync?

after <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/</a> got an update and it uses the Highwind Player for the videos, the arrow keys don't work.
By pressing left or right arrow key, the video doesn't move 5 seconds back or forward, however, pressing ""J"" and ""L"" does move the video back and forward (""K"" pauses/plays the video), pressing up or down doesn't change the volume. Starting Firefox in private browsing or using Edge however, the arrow keys work normally, rewinding or forwarding the video and increasing/decreasing sound. The contrary is also true, J,K,L only work with normal Frefox, but don't do anything on private browser or other borwsers. My question is, since the private browsing is still using the standard player, is there any way I can force the standard Firefox to use the normal player instead of the Highwind Player? 
Thank you.

I need this older FF, because I can use Java on it and I need Java to use one website.
The problem is - since 69.02 I have problem, that after I use oder FF, my new FF deactivates all addons. There are addon in options, but there is no way to use them. So I need to install them again. They work flawless, but when I close FF 69, run FF 51, close 51 and run 69 again, then addons (like ghostery or adblock) are disabled, and can't be enabled.
