I want to create a new folder and put more bookmarks in it.  This is easy to do, but FireFox puts the new folder at the bottom of the list.

Having used Firefox as my preferred browser under Windows 8 for a number of years, I have amassed a large number of bookmarks. I subsequently upgraded the laptop to Windows 10, and have not used Firefox for some time, not having needed the internet for much other than email.
When I went to launch Firefox recently, the shortcut didn't work, so I updated to the new version of Firefox and found all of the bookmarks had gone.  I was advised to look for 'bookmarks.html', but I have been unable to find such a file. 
Please advise if it is possible to recover the old bookmarks on the computer?

I've just installed Firefox 68.0.1 on my work laptop running Windows 10. We don't have full admin rights on these devices, but are able to run programs ""as"" the Administrator. By doing this Firefox installs without issue, as have all other programs I've needed to add.
However, upon launching Firefox for the first time I immediately get the message ""Sorry. We just need to do one small thing to keep going. We have just installed an update in the background. Click Restart Firefox to finish applying it. We will restore all your pages, windows and tabs afterwards, so you can be on your way quickly."" When I click Restart, Firefox reload and immediately shows the same message. It doesn't matter how many times I restart the browser the message keeps coming up.
I CAN successfully start Firefox if I use safe mode, but as soon as I try again without safe mode, the issue described above immediately happens.
I've tried disabling the update service, but nothing seems to make a difference.
I'd really appreciate some help/advice on why Firefox thinks an update has occurred. What is Firefox looking at to determine an update has been applied?
Many Thanks....

The news tells me that ""just"" the cookie option will be enabled by default, meaning that the trackers are still loaded.
</p><p>Lets talk about the effects in case of google analytics?
When I activate the tracker-block option or use adblock, I will get errors in the developer console (or in add ons) that google analytics isn't found/loaded.
When I activate the upcoming third party tracker cookie option I DON'T get this message - so analytics is still executed. Isn't analytics simply not working anymore at all because it is using its cookies OR are there only SOME functions of analytics that will not work anymore?
</p><p>Could anyone clarfiy this for me?

Gosh, but I hate Firefox Sync!!  I didn't realise that I was permanently signed in to my account across both devices once I had, just for a laugh, signed in 1 week ago.  As a result, my bookmarks had automatically synced across two users on the same device, which I didn't want to happen.  As I didn't want this, I deleted - when logged on as user 2 - the bookmarks that had been synced across from  user 1.  Then when I logged back in as user 1, those bookmarks had been deleted there as well  becasue of that damn Sync function.
Is there ANY way I can get those deleted bookmarks back as user 1?  I have permanently signed out of Sync now and hope I never see the damn thing again.

Many website owners and CDN providers want the web servers or proxy servers to be able to do load balancing. For example, when the server is overloaded, redirect the request to some other servers; or based on the client IP address, send the client to a server that can provide better performance.
What they can use today is the 30X redirection. Which has many limitations:
1. breaks the cookie, if you 30x redirect to another hostname or IP address.
2. breaks https if you redirect to another IP address.
We need another way of telling the client/browser to only change the IP address but keep everything else the same. I'm proposing a simple addition to the HTTP protocol: new status code, for example: 312 with 2 new headers: ""x-redirect-ipv4"" and ""x-redirect-ipv6"". When a server wants to redirect the client to a different IP for whatever reason, it just returns this status code with headers with the IPv4 or v6 addresses. When the client (Firefox in this case) receives this, it picks one of the returned IPs and makes exactly the same HTTP(S) request again to that IP.

</p><p>I've gone through all the typical process of eliminations - verify it's not just my Firefox, my machine, my application, etc.
Scenario:
1)..Launch Firefox and visit a website that displays a Google Map.
2)..Click a link to leave that page and then return back to the page (either back-button-history or via a link).
3)..Notice that the tiles of the map are not displayed.  It appears as though Firefox is trying/failing to use some sort of its own cache(?) of the map tiles and is failing to render them.  Most other map layers will display (i.e.: markers).
</p><p>Easy to reproduce on Google's own API demo page:
1)..Visit:  <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map</a>
</p><pre>    and notice the sample map (see screenshot below as ""before"" image).
</pre>
<p>2)..Click a link on that page, so that you leave that page.
3)..Go back to the previous page and notice the map doesn't display the tiles (see ""after"" image attached).
</p><p>Observations:
1)..The above scenario fails on all sites I've tested, through different users/machines/demographics.
2)..The above works great in IE11, Chrome, Safari, just not Firefox.

</p><p>due to privacy reasons I try to set up FireFox in the best fashion I can.
But I feel like all this effort is somehow useless, because I feel like I still get “tracked down”.
</p><p>I would like to share my browser configuration, and see what you can tell me in addition to that.
</p><p>Lets start with about:config, all values that are a) not standard and b) somehow connected to this topic:
app.normandy.enabled;false

</p><p>Already some Q:
1. SafeBrowsing used by Google
The about:config shows that for SafeBrowsing Google Services are used.
Is there any other provider I can change to, or simply deactivate that feature/not use that feature?
</p><p>2. Fonts:
Fonts can be used to identify such unique mix on different systems.
I want to take control of that, but the AddOns I tried are insufficient.
Do you know any AddOn to take control of the Fonts that can be read out of the browser,
or does anyone have some experiences which font should be left default, so the rest can be deactivated?
</p><p>My AddOns:

Not good either! Any idea how they detect this? I can only imagine they readout the list file which has some notes, but this would require the browser to hand over the list which seems unlikely – or they detect it by cross-checking values that are known to be unique, but these seems not as precise as the results are (qouting me exactly what subscriptions I got).
Q: Any suggestions how to prevent a readout and hide his aswell?
</p><p><br>
General behaviour:
All Tabs are in his own container – cookies are deleted after closing such Tab. JS and flash is deactivated by default – they only receive referrers from the same domain – and the IP, UserAgent, Canvas and other values are fake.
I do not use any social media or other big player services, like YouTube, with accounts. All accounts I use are just on small web community boards and shop systems.
</p><p>But: At the end of the day the advertising industry and big players are able to identify me more or less. I see stuff that is too close to me to be random on a daily basis.
</p><p>So I am asking myself: How?
</p><p>The only thing to blame myself that I am aware of, is that I use FireFox on my a few desktops and mobile phones and set it up quite the same way. But every device of mine is behind VPN hops and use his own DNS, so it should not be any of that.

</p><p>Hello all
</p><p>i wanted to use FF as my default PDF viewer and since i wasn't able to do so in the Windows settings, i right clicked on a file and chose my default program.
</p><p>-first issue; all my pdf files took the FF icon instead of the default PDF one.
only solutions I've found was changing things in the registry which i wont do and the other one(not sure if it works)was to reinstall FF which i prefer not to do since everything is nicely set up.
</p><p>-second issue; in FF options i chose ""always ask""in case i accidentally open a PDF file when clicking on a link in google search,not noticing it's a PDF document.
the issue is that when i chose 'open' from the pop-up window,it opened a blank page,not the actual PDF i (haven't checked what happens with 'save'.)
so i reverted to 'preview in Firefox'.(also i don't recall this happening with previous windows os;7-8.1)
</p><p>-third issue(the worst one which caused a moment of panic :); choosing 'firefox to automatically open a file type' cause the opening of infinite blank tabs one after the other.
it seems to be a very old bug and I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed yet,
the solution is not to chose this option.

</p><p>so for the moment being I've reverted to Edge as the default PDF viewer.
</p><p>the main issue for me out of all these three, is to get those icons to show the correct description and not the FF one.

I would do something about that, but most of the laptop settings are behind a parental admin lock.
So when Windows reboots, any Firefox window gets closed. Opening it back used to prompt a session restore page and nothing else. But now, reopening causes these symptoms:
I'm logged out of ""Sync""
There's a tab about a Privacy Notice or something
There's a 'new tab' with a popup talking about the features of Firefox or something
Any Top Sites I pinned are GONE
""@amazon"" is pinned for no reason
I think my search sites settings are gone
Pretty sure I added a search bar to the toolbar, but not anymore
The theme reset to this default dark blue
Signing back into Sync does not solve any of this
What do I do about this madness???

I can't change every password!,"<p>I am so sick of Google, I decided to give Firefox a try again.  For the first time, it offered me Monitor, which demonstrated I have suffered a data breach, apparently at multiple sites, and they have all gotten hold of the same one of my passwords.  Even though I suspect Y'all are aware that the breach was not my doing, Firefox is set up to treat me like an idiot after the fact, going into detail about safe passwords and using password manager apps--the whole thing about not using one password for multiple sites and all that, which I've been aware of and responded to cautiously and reliably for about the last fifteen years, of about twenty that I've been online.
</p><p>The problem is that I am very internet savvy, so that info, as helpful as it is meant to be, is useless to me and a bit offensive.  I have been using LastPass for about the last five years.  I have nearly 300 unique passwords.  It is useless to me to be told that some strangers have access to one of my nearly 300 passwords.  What am I supposed to do with that information, change all my passwords?  Why did they not provide me the password that was part of the breach, so I can hunt it down and change it?  Right now, all it's done is set me up to worry, when in fact, the forces that absconded with my data, presumably as part of huge data breaches involving major companies, probably have no interest in me whatsoever!  I think presenting things in this manner, as well meant as it may have been, is a bit irresponsible and condescending.  Not everyone out here is an idiot, even if we may not be computer techs.  Is there any way I can learn which of my many passwords was part of this breach?  What else am I supposed to do with this info, when I already have unique passwords for all of my many accounts and I use a password manager?
</p><p>I mean no offense in presenting my frustration and understand you all are volunteers and not responsible for the problems as I have outlined them.  I hope someone can  help me sort this out.

Yesterday, upon booting up, when clicking on the RT tab I got only my blank (opening) page or the prior page I'd been on.  RT wouldn't load. Similarly the 'News' add-on opened but displayed nothing.  All my other bookmark tabs worked normally, I could access RT via IE (no tab groups of course).  Trying different means (such as opening specific RT URLs I could sometimes access that URL but it would frequently go blank (as if FF was saying 'Opps, I let that one through by mistake') but couldn't open other RT pages from that one.

Záložky ale nevyexportuje, nahlásí, že spí, zablokuje procesor na více než 100% a přestane fungovat. Dnes tj. 16. července 2019 odmítá ukládat i nové záložky. Instalovaná verze firefox 67.0.4., opreační systém Linux mint 18.3. Nepomohla ani přeinstalace firefoxu. Návod na exportování záložek na vašem webu nefunguje. Co mám dělat?
</p><p>Další problém, který s firefoxem mám, prohlížeč po ukončení se zcela neukončí a běží dál. Je nutné ho v prohlížeči systémových procesů ukončit ručně.

it said good things about firefox quantum -- I DO NOT KNOW if that is what i have now, i don't think so, but I do not want any headaches, i never want to be blocked from a site over friggin' cookies nd not be able to quickly clear them out. 
and then it says this:

We think it’s best to go with a big project with a large number of developers that receives a lot of attention to security.

I tried deleting the Scratchpad event listener code, then hitting run. I tried exiting out of scratchpad and the tab that I was using, restarting my computer, etc. Though I don't know if those last steps would make a difference.

</p><p>Firefox does not play videos after windows 10 computer returns from sleep. In fact, if I visit video url such as this one <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4</a> directly it still does not play. I works fine until I put my computer to sleep. It is not connection problem because everything other than videos work. And with other browsers, videos also work. This problem started to happen recently for no good reason  - no windows update or FF update that caused it.   Does firefox play videos on it's own or does it depend on some external components? Tab icon shows me infinitely  loading animation. However, when I open dev tools and network tab, it shows me that it's downloading 771kb, which is the correct size of that video. When I right click and choose view page source then I can also see the contents of mp4 file. So it looks like file itself is downloaded but there is some component that does not get notification. 
</p><p>Is there anyone who could explain how does video playing work in firefox internally?

Keep in mind that the whole application uses jQuery and that other browsers (IE, Edge, Chrome) do not have this issue and always they return to page ""# 1""
Thanks

</p><p>Hello,
</p><p>WebVR implementation in Firefox has improved significantly but still some bugs are prohibitive from using it reliably. More specifically, integration with SteamVR appears to be problematic. Here's a test scenario.
</p><p>How to replicate the problem:
</p><p>0) Ensure SteamVR is installed and operational, using a compatible VR kit.
</p><p>1) Visit <a href=""https://sketchfab.com/AliceVision/models"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sketchfab.com/AliceVision/models</a>
</p><p>2) Open one of the models and select the VR icon (bottom right).
</p><p>3) Once the 3D model is presented in the VR headset, close the 3D model from within the web page and return to the list of 3D models (main page).
</p><p>4) 1st issue: Notice that in the headset, SteamVR shows that it's waiting for the application (Firefox in this case) to respond. This should not normally happen, i.e. when Firefox has no content to present, it should present a default 3D scene, for example: a dome with a firefox logo in the middle. Also, if you click on the System Button on the VR controller, the SteamVR Dashboard pops up BUT it does not offer the option to disengage/disconnect Firefox from SteamVR. That keeps SteamVR locked into Firefox. If you wait long enough, you get the ERRORS shown in the attached images.
</p><p>5) Open another 3D model and click on the VR button. The new model should appear in the VR headset.
</p><p>6) 2st issue: The VR controller is not longer tracked by Firefox.
</p><p>I hope you find the above useful and easy to replicate. If you need additional information, please do let me know.
</p><p>Kind regards

I'm at work and wanted to access a single bookmark folder from my home computer. I tried to login to my firefox account through a WEB PAGE - hoping I could access a list of bookmark like I used to do back when XMarks was a thing, I did NOT click on firefox synch ! However, firefox somehow decided that it meant I wanted to synch and started messing everything up. It added all my home bookmarks to my workplace computer, ruined the history (merge), extensions and so on. So I told it to disconnect sync and remove the sync data.
Guess what ? It didn't just remove the data it just got from sync. It totally destroyed everything. Work bookmarks, gone. History, gone. Addons, all gone. It's nearly as if FF was a brand new installation.
I'm panicking right now.
Is there any way to go back ?

Surprise; FF just updated itself and needs to restart.... here was me thinking I had set it to notify me when there is an update, but it looks like a previous update removed that function. 
I suddenly found I couldn't open usable tabs, all I would get is a lovely message telling me FF had updated and needed to restart, but not to worry because it will restore my session!
Now, I had 3 sessions  open with each having 15-20 tabs, and they all had to be closed and reloaded... Oh well it looks like I don't have a choice so here goes...
I clicked restart and waited, it didn't restart!
Ok, so I have to manually do the relaunch thing, great, my 3 FF windows are returning..... But oh wow each tab has to reload, the udtube vids all returned to there start position, my DuckDuck search pages and are now blank!
So all told I lost about 10 minutes and some work because someone knows what is best for me and just went ahead and changed the browsers settings.
I get why this was done, I mean when ms started pulling stunts like this their users were all super impressed and heaped so much praise on them it was a little embarrassing... Oh what fun!

1264660,2019-07-14 22:34:07 -0800,2019-09-05T02:02:49Z,"I followed all the instructions in the article ""Recovering important data from an old profile,"" but when I open FF, there are no bookmarks and no history.","<p>At least, I think I followed all the instructions.  After I created the new profile, I went to the section that reads:
</p><p>Important: Firefox must be closed down while copying files between profile folders. Also, Step 1 refers to your ""old"" profile folder - the profile containing data you want to copy to a new profile. If you can't open a profile from within Firefox, see Finding your profile without opening Firefox.
</p><p>I found this instruction a little irritating—if in step one ""profile"" means ""old profile folder,"" then why not say so?   But the big problem is that, with the warning that Firefox must be closed down, I closed FF.  
</p><p>Then I came across this:
</p><p>Open your profile folder:
From the Help menu, choose Troubleshooting Information. The Troubleshooting Information tab will open.
Under the Application Basics section, click on 
Show in Finder
. A window will open that contains your profile folder.
</p><p>Well, these instructions forced me to open Ff again—but to my dismay, when I went to the Application Basics section, and looked at Show in Finder, it wasn't my old profile that showed, but my new one.   Since I only found my old profile picture in the first place by following the same instructions to go to Application Basics when I was told to make a copy of the old profile, which was at that time my current profile, I only got to that profile because it opened automatically—I didn't remember the path, so I don't know how to find it.   But since I did make a copy of it to my external hard drive, I opened my Old Profile from there.
</p><p>Then this:
Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click Quit Firefox.
</p><p>So I quit FF.  
</p><p>Then this:
Hold down the control key while you click on a file you want to copy and choose Copy.
Open the new Firefox profile folder.
</p><p>I found this confusing; why in the world would I be told to click on a file to copy before I was told to open the new profile?   And where WAS the new profile?   
</p><p>So I opened FF again, went to Application Basics, and then opened the new profile, then closed FF again.
</p><p>So I was once more at this step:
</p><p>Hold down the control key while you click on a file you want to copy and choose Copy.
</p><p>But it occurred to me that, rather than repeat this step for each individual item, why not just drag the first sub-folder from the Old Profile to the New One?   I tried that, but got a message saying that the folder was invisible, so I selected everything in that folder and just dragged it into the new profile.
</p><p>I clicked on everything in the second sub-folder in the Old Profile, but when I dropped the selection in the New Profile, I got a message saying that there were copies, so I stopped.   Since I didn't know why there were two sub-folders in the Old Profile, I thought that, in order to make sure that everything from the Old Profile Folder was in the NPF, I created two sub-folders in the NPF, one entitled ""0 untitled"" and the other ""O untitled 2.""   Then I selected and dragged everything that I had transferred from the first sub-folder of the OPF into the NPF *before* I had created sub-folders for the NPF, and I dragged them into ""0 untitled.""   Then I revisited the second sub-folder of the OPF, selected its contents, then dragged and dropped them into the NPF sub-folder ""0 untitled 2.""   
</p><p>When I got to the section ""Your important data and their files,"" I was a little confused, because at first I thought I had to transfer these manually because they were not in the OPF, so I searched for them, but when I selected the ""places.sqlite"" and tried to drag and drop it, I got a message asking whether I wished to delete the file from the Cloud—since I didn't, I didn't.   Finally it occurred to me that perhaps they were in the OPF, so I looked, and they were.
</p><p>The article ends without any instructions as to what to do once you have finished transferring files from the OPF to the NPF, so I simply clicked on FF, which opened without the data.   I closed FF, then shut down and restarted my computer, but when I opened FF, still no data.   
</p><p>I thought perhaps that I had been wrong to drag and drop, so I opened the copy of my OPF on my external hard drive, then opened FF again t the Application Basics so that I could open the NPF in the finder.  When the NPF opened, I was surprised to see that the two sub-folders no longer had the titles I gave them, but had rather the strange string of numbers and letters reminiscent of the names of the invisible folders in the OPF.   
</p><p>Should I create another new profile folder and then go through the laborious process of selecting one file, clicking copy, then going into the NPF, without the sub-folders, and then click ""Paste""?  If I do that for one sub-folder from the OPF, should I create a first sub-folder for the NPF, and then put all the laboriously transferred files from the first sub-folder of the OPF into the new first sub-folder of the NPF, and then repeat that process when I transfer the files laboriously one by one from the second sub-folder of the OPF into the NPF?   
</p><p>I am at a loss, and would appreciate help.

When the themes were not animating the appearance of the theme page differed from when the themes were working.
</p><p>Attachment 1 shows the theme page when the theme is enabled and working. Attachment 2 shows the theme page appearance when it is not working. Clicking on the 3 dots on the bottom right (when they are not working) takes you into the settings for the theme but there is no way of re-activating the animation.
</p><p>I have found the only way of re-activating the animation in all of the animated themes I have is to do a system restore back to 10th July 2019. This is not practical to do  every time I close down my computer and re-open it to find my animated theme not working.
</p><p>If I do a system restore and get the animated themes working and log out of Firefox the themes will not be working when I log in again in the same working session on my PC.
