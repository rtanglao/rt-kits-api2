1272046,2019-11-02 12:41:23 -0800,2019-11-03T14:48:35Z,"Firefox crashed, automatic session restore did not incur, manual restore previous session is grey and there is no sessionrestore file nor backups","<p>So, as summarized in the title, Firefox crashed (probably due to RAM running out as I'm typing my thesis and have a few hundres tabs open for research etc.) and when I restarted the automatic session restore did not restore my tabs and windows, the start page did not ask if I wanted to restore the previous session and the restore session option itself in the menu was greyed out.
</p><p>I checked the FF default profile folder and the sessionstore.js file was completely missing, and the sessionstore-backups folder only had two files (recovery.jsonlz4 &amp; recovery.baklz4) that were both only 2kb in size. I suspected these are simply the empty starting page and using a third party website to inspect the contents trhe suspicion turned out to be correct.
</p><p>So, what I'm wondering is are there any other older backup files saved anywhere in the FF folders that could be used instead? I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups. And further, is it possible to recover all those tabs and windows somehow if the only backup files are blank as I discovered? I have not closed FF after relaunching the first time after the crash in order not to create any more blank backups.
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any light you might be able to shed on this.

Question is can I get rid of Lockwise or it it built into FF?  Wish they (Firefox) had warned me about this when updating.   Then they are forcing me into having a Firefox account and trying their best to make me sync passwords which I don't want to sync anything.  Besides, I only use FF on this PC.  Mozilla is getting into too much cloud storing issues for me.
</p><p>Also, it seems FF started syncing just about all my data, passwords, bookmarks......... when I started an account.  I went into options and stopped by unchecking all they checked without asking and did a disconnect.   But there was a message that seem to say they already had sync and I couldn't delete their data they synced.

</p><p>Firefox 70 on a Fedora 30/31 KDE machine will freeze the entire machine within minutes (sometimes seconds) of launch.  A hard reboot is usually the only way to reset.  The issue is not associated with any particular URL.
</p><p>The System: 
</p><p>Operating System: Fedora 31 /
KDE Plasma Version: 5.16.5 /
KDE Frameworks Version: 5.61.0 /
Qt Version: 5.12.5 /
Kernel Version: 5.3.7-301.fc31.x86_64 /
OS Type: 64-bit /
Processors: 4 × Intel® Core™ i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz /
Memory: 7.7 GiB of RAM
</p><p>When It Started: 
</p><p>The problem began as soon as Firefox was updated to version 70 on the Fedora 30 installation.  I then upgraded Fedora itself to 31, but the Firefox problem persisted.
</p><p>What I have tried:
</p><p>1. I created a brand new user on the system and ran Firefox from that account.  Problem still exists.
</p><p>2. I launched Firefox from the command line in safe mode. Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ firefox -safe-mode
</pre>
<p>3. I launched Firefox with Wayland.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
</pre>
<p>4. I launched Firefox with X11.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-x11
</pre>
<p><br>
Something odd:
</p><p>The user agent string being presented by Firefox is inaccurate.  It is presenting itself as 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
</p><p>And yet this is definitely FF70 on Fedora, as I can attest to, unless I have gone insane and am not realizing it yet.   It particularly troubles me that I have to post this support request from a different browser (so disregard the auto-detected user agent associated with this post).  Oh, the humanity!

I googled around and found a bunch of previous answers, and tried about 10 different settings in about config, but the only one that seemed to help was mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y, but that also makes it scroll more than a single page, which isnt OK. I dont need it to drag at the top or bottom of a scroll or be animated at all, I just want it to instantly flip to the next or a previous page.

I have to use a custom built GStreamer based video decoder plugin and that is why I'm using v51. There are two screens each playing 4 streams each. The videos play at 30fps without any problem once displayed on browser. There is a switch button which can switch between 2 sets of 4 streams each (quad view). When the pages are switched, say for about 100-200 times, the responsiveness of the browser slows down gradually and at one point, it just stops to respond to any further clicks.  When Firefox froze, CPU utilization is about 30%, RAM about 25%.  
I tried to modify about:config parameters, but could not figure out which are the most relevant to my use case and the optimum values to be set. 
</p><p>I request community's help to identify the parameter combinations in v51.0.1 that could potentially keep Firefox from slowing down. In case more information is required, I will be glad to give them, but please suggest on how to get them out of the browser.

So in the original profile folder I have:
</p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD
    places.sqlite-shmOLD
    places.sqlite-walOLD
</pre>
<p>that didn’t help things.
Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’
</p><p>So I have:
</p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD
      prefs-1jsOLD
      prefs-2.jsOLD
      prefs-3.jsOLD
                  Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them
</pre>
<p>That didn’t help.
</p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop.
Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it.
</p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’).
</p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile. 
Same issues.
Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again.
Rebooted.
</p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open).
</p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox).
I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; …..
</p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile!
</p><p>The ‘default-release’ profile and the brand new one I created were never changed or touched; never added the word OLD to anything in there; made no changes.
</p><p>So Firefox wouldn’t close; so I had to do all of the above again (try to end task in task manager; delete parent.lock, and reboot).
</p><p>So now I’m at my wits end!!!
</p><p>I can’t find anything left to try.  : (
</p><p>I hope someone can help!
</p><p>Thanks!

The Copy menu item in the Edit menu becomes greyed out and no selected text is copied. I can correct this by quitting Firefox and restarting; then the Copy menu item is available again and I can copy web page text. All other programs continue to provide copy functions even as Firefox is not able to copy. One other point. When I run Firefox after a computer crash it will bring up a page, then close it, then reopen the page. That is my reminder that I won't be able to copy items without first quitting.

Since the GPU is non-metal I am forced to use Dark Mode, which turns the Firefox 68esr bookmarks/history sidebars (among other Firefox items) to almost unreadable black text on black background. Partial workaround I have found is this CSS, below, which works perfectly for the history sidebar, but not for the bookmarks sidebar. (Note, the same CSS works perfectly in Waterfox Classic, using Classic Theme Restorer, Custom CSS Code, for both history and bookmarks, where the different sidebars can be selected from buttons, instead of only from a dropdown in the FF68.)
</p><p>EDIT: PLEASE NOTE, after posting, the CSS is not formatted correctly. Not seeing any way to format as code, nor do I see any other formatting options for this original post. Several of the number/hash signs (#) are replaced by 1, which is not correct. Other formatting issues as well. PLEASE SEE SCREENSHOT OF CORRECTLY FORMATTED CSS:

a. saving the new firefox loader to my computer
b. Deleting the Firefox folder in Program files
c. Deleting the Mozilla ""upkeep"" files. (I can't actually remember the name of this folder)
d. fixing broken links in the registry.
e. reloading Firefox.

</p><p>Since release of the Firefox 70 I noticed that all FTP content opened via direct links is being saved right away, instead of being displayed. As I understand, this was done to close this ""bug"": <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699</a>. Though I guess this change can be beneficial for most users, it's also causing unnecessary problem to me a my colleagues at work.
</p><p>We are technical support team and we are working in the ticketing  system called BMC Remedy. All file attachments sent by our customers are uploaded to our internal FTP server and then linked to the tickets via direct FTP links. Before release of the 70th version it was very convenient for us to click on those files, and get files opened straight inside browser. It worked flawlessly, especially for image and text files and saved us a lot of time. It was also the main reason we used Firefox, since in Chrome always (at least recently) saved files instead of displaying them.
</p><p>But the release of 70th version messed up everything for us, and now all the files need to be saved before they can be opened which causes a lot of inconvenience. So much so, we had to downgrade back to 69th version to work normally.
</p><p>As I said at the beginning, I do understand the reason behind this change since FTP vulnerabilities can harm users on public websites. However, inside closed environments like intranets there is no such threats, and losing ability to quickly preview FTP resources can hurt productivity. So in my opinion, while it's a good idea to have this behavior enabled by default, there should be an option under about:config to enable rendering of the FTP resources back. Or maybe someone at least can make an extension or Greasemonkey script that would bring this functionality back.
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is correct place, but I don't know where else to post this to bring attention to this problem.

Ich habe mir eine UserChrome.css gemacht, die gut funktioniert hat, dann kam Firefox 57? und die Anpassbarkeit war Geschichte.
Wer mit mehreren Tabs arbeitet und dafür sind die Tabs doch da, muss die Maus mehr bewegen und es ist unübersichtlich. Wäre es nicht sinnvoll, dass was ich am häufigsten benutze, in der Nähe der Arbeitsfläche zu haben? Wäre es nicht besser die Tab Leiste standardmäßig nach unten zu legen und wer es anders möchte, der kann sich alle 10 oder 15 Versionen, eine UserChrome.css basteln.

This LIVE DVD crashes or drops out from time to time so each time this happens I have to re-sync the Firefox it brings up.  This re-sync requires a verification code to be sent by email, but because that email has to go through my Google filtering process,  it usually takes longer than the code's 5 minute validity before I  receive it.   When I do finally get it and enter the received code back in Firefox,  I'm told the code is invalid or expired.   This is because 5 minutes validity is just too short a  time for my setup.  If it were 10 minutes, that would allow me to go into Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt;  Accounts &amp; Import -&gt; Check email from other accounts -&gt; and then order Gmail to perform a special immediate mailcheck on my selected account.   
As a slow elderly old codger myself,  I find it too hard to do all this within 5 minutes.  Why can't we make it 10 mins?
