None worked.

</p><p>So official Mozilla articles about this are not helping at all. It s really disappointing to see people reporting this serious problem since 2012 and still a permanent fix to it has not been provided by Mozilla.
Please, I need some volunteer who would think out of the box and give a comprehensive solution.
</p><p>Note: One of the many suggestions in the official articles asks us to manually delete or rename the profile.ini file. I am reluctant to do this UNLESS I AM REASSURED that last session windows and tabs if Firefox opens with the new profile will not be lost. I mean the new profile wont open them obviously, but if I switch back to the old profile I need those to open.

</p><p>I've searched and read all I can about his topic but although I see many that are almost exactly like it, I don't see any that are exactly like it. The advice to set Firefox with all bookmarks, extension, etc. like I want it then click ""Disconnect"" in Sync the reconnect is a common ""fix"" but it does not work.
</p><p>The problem is this: Evidently, some time ago I did a sync on some device or another that had Firefox, possibly Ubuntu on my laptop. Also evident is the fact that the bookmarks, extensions, etc. are a huge mess in that sync.
</p><p>Now when I re-installed Firefox on my desktop yesterday and placed my good backup of the profile into the proper profile folder, which is exactly like I want everything , all is good at this point, I then sign in to Sync and instantly the ""bad"" sync comes ""in"" and garbles everything into a mess.
</p><p>So my question is whether there is a way (I'm sure it's simple, I'm just dense) to use this current Firefox on my desktop to be the ""master"" that all other devices sync to? I just described above what happens when I set it exactly like I like it then sign in to sync, so that's no good as a solution.

Then I read that I should wait for Ubuntu's version. So I went to the Ubuntu software site and downloaded 65.01. That downloaded and installed itself automatically, which is what I expected. 
Then I saw several news blogs from the last 48 hours saying there was a bug that needed fixing immediately. I followed the information and downloaded FF 67.01. And then my archiver program said it could not open it because it was not the right archive type. 
I also saw something on your site about FF being self updating. That's not happening, either. 
Bottom line, I have a new but dangerously buggy version of FF, and apparently no way to upgrade it.

Firefox always worked just fine until i did the manual windows update, now anything i do, whether scrolling, switching tabs, clicking something, will cause Firefox to lag and hang for several seconds before going on. Usually when i start up, it is just fine, then after about 5 minutes once i actually try to do anything, it starts the hanging. i notice that my computer fan sometimes will kick on almost exactly when the hanging begins as well... Google chrome works just fine, but I really don't want to switch browsers since I love Firefox and have all my bookmarks and logins on it, and I dont want to go back to a previous windows version. I have tried every single step in all the trouble shooting guides posted here, and nothing fixed it. Any help?

All way ok, to start with ... once I added 4-5 emails on top of my main one, things started to get strange and some of the verification emails generated a ""Error: You must be signed in to your Firefox Account."" however I was signed in to sync and other monitor tabs were open!
Eventually I used Chrome, which seemed happier to add the other 50 historic family and work emails and activate them.
Last night I used Firefox and all was ok seeing the data.
Today I cannot log in via firefox (I can to my sync account just fine) and have even reset the password. 
I know the new password has propogated as the old password generates a ""bad password"" error. The same error, see pic below, and a new error randomly alternate.
I have tried ctrl F5, clearing the cache, cookies, etc etc, same result
I have tried different PC's same result, 3 in total, all had to be relogged in with new sync password, but none will access the monitor site.
Sometimes, from the login screen showing the email and pciture I get my picture, sometimes not, sometimes it fails with an error (sorry no picture) before the password is requested. The same you must be signed in error is the message, so same picture as below.
</p><p>HELP!! :-( 
What else can I do or is this some system/server error?

I backed up my Profile folder first and then did the uninstall/install. I then reinstalled the add-on that had been having a problem. The good news is that my problem was resolved. The bad news was that I needed to restore as much of my old configuration setup and things like history and bookmarks. The latter item was fairly simple, I just had to copy places.sqlite from my old profile folder to the new profile folder. Then I reinstalled the other add-ons which had been installed on my previous config. So far so good. 
The next task, which was probably the most complex and possibly troublesome was to actually restore all of the changes that had been made by me and Firefox itself to the actual config options. Although I didn't keep track over the years, I had made dozens of config changes to fix problems or to get Firefox to work the way I wanted it to. These changes were all made after searching on sites like this, so they were not done capriciously. So I wanted to restore these changes. I copied the prefs.js file from my old profile into the new profile. The only problem I noticed was the that the icons for all the add-ons disappeared from the area to the right of the address bar and search bar. 
I don't know what this area is called, but it also includes the 'hamburger"" icon to open the Firefox menu.
</p><p>Can anyone tell me which config option this is, or is it controlled by something else?

I always update to the latest version of Firefox.
I can do this automatically to my Laptop  from Firefox.
What I would like to do directly from the Firefox Site is download the update file  (approx 45Mb) to  a backup device first.
My reason is that if for some reason my  Hard disk fails   or the pc gets corrupted ,once fixed I can reinstall Firefox from my backup device rather than have to go to the Website and select download from there.
Until recently I used to update Firefox (and other programs) via the <a href=""http://filehippo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">filehippo.com</a> site.
Recently that site seems to have become flawed. It shows a new update version  e.g xxx.167      but when one selects that to download  it is in fact an earlier version e.g xxx.154. That filehippo comment applies to many other programs too.

Things were changed but not for the better. The first problem I had with bookmarks was resolved by a nice, helpful person on this forum. But I have more bookmark problems.
</p><p>1) All of the bookmark folders that had been open in the previous release I was on were all closed after the upgrade. Now I can't scroll down the bookmarks (""Show All Bookmarks"") to find what I want as all of the folders were closed and I couldn't see what was in them, not the entries nor the sub-folders. I have been going through the annoying and time consuming process of going to each folder one at a time and opening it again. Is there some way to fix this awful FF upgrade ""feature"" and open all of the bookmark folders at one time?
</p><p>2) Even though I I've been manually going through the bookmark folders (in ""Show all bookmarks"") to open them, when I use Ctl-D to bookmark a URL the folders are still closed. So I can't see what similar URL was saved where. Nor can I see the sub-folders. So question #2:  is there a way to force FF to re-open all folders (and show the sub-folders) in the Ctl-D function when it displays the bookmark folder list without having to  manually open each folder a second time in the CTl-D function?.

I am able to successfully log into the user authenticated website without difficulty and begin to download various files. However, I will suddenly encounter a ""401"" web page when I attempt to download a file - the 401 web page states that my accesss has been disconnected. I have found that if I refresh this 401 web page then select the browser's back button, I will be able to download the file. But, if I proceed to attempt to download other files, I may be successful but will usually encounter the same 401 web page when I attempt to download a subsequent file.
</p><p>As I indicated above, this problem is new to me, in that it appears to have started to occur in recent weeks. Additionally, sometimes when I am attempting to download a file, a login dialog box will appear center screen requesting my user name and password. The text that appears in this login dialog box states that the website that I am viewing is not requesting the login and will not be sent to the website that I am viewing, so I simply disregard the login dialog box and close it and repeat my attempt to download the file, which I am usually able to accomplish successfully.
</p><p>Based on the above information, do you have any idea what is going on with my login access? Might a recent update of Firefox account for this strange occurance? I have not made any changes to my computer or Firefox that would account for these strange occurances, and I most certainly do have antivirus and antimalware software active on my computer. However, I do not know if any of the new features associated with the recent Firefox updates or any configuration settings may be the source of this problem.

No way to reload my saved logins into firefox. Every time I restart firefox with the correct logins.json (the old one renamed) it does not connect to sync and it told me to re-connect to sync. Then, it rename the logins.json and create another file with no saved logins.

You should update it right away.""

However the Share facility hasn't worked for about 2 weeks: it either buffers for ages when I press the Share button, or the Share button doesn't take me to the magazine (stuck on Share on page you manage). Everything has been updated (Mac, Firefox &amp; Facebook). What is strange is that I have no problem in Chrome. The trouble is Firefox is my default browser and I'd like to keep it that way. If anyone has come across this problem and found a solution, please let me know in bullet point steps. Many thanks.
