In a non-persistent VDI environment, on occasion we have users that experience the dreaded ""Couldn't load XPCOM"" popup error message. In my research this usually is attributed to a faulty/corrupt update. We are a VMware View shop using instant clones with what's called a ""Writable Volume"" which is, in essence, a file system filter that allows certain user data to be written to persistent storage and the rest is written to the non-persistent VM. Upon logout the persistent disk is detached and the non-persistent VM is removed/rebuilt.
</p><p>We are using the ESR branch of Firefox with policies configured to disable automatic updating, so I'm not sure where Firefox is breaking. Is there anything I can do to assist? On top of this, it's more difficult to reproduce since I'm unable to causing it to error out myself.

Currently, to my limited knowledge, if a particular entry in the browsing-history is deleted, then all instances of that web-page are deleted from history ; e.g. if I visited a certain web-page of YouTube on 1st Jan, then again on 20th Jan, and then on 30th Mar, but wished to remove the last entry - I would right-click that entry in the ""Library window"" and select ""delete"" and that would result in all of the three visits getting wiped out. I am sure the features of ""most recent visit"" &amp; ""number of visits"" are useful for many but like I explained before, combining all entries in one creates a bigger problem of hampering the flow of recording one's activities (even if it helps reduce RAM usage). 
Currently, this is one of the main problems that I face while using Firefox (for over a year) and always forces me to go back to Chrome (where extensions exist to properly manage history, but are not available for Firefox because of fundamental differences in both programs, while the current Firefox add-ons regarding history are all useless).              
If anyone could properly guide me out of this problem, I would be grateful. Thanks in advance.

There is no day that doesn't crash.
This phenomenon suddenly occurred frequently about six months ago(Maybe before more).
I thought that it originated from a PC, but it is presumed to be different because other PCs have become frequent.
Does anyone have a similar situation?
To be honest, I'm not professional, so I don't know what caused it. I tried safe mode, but the result is the same.
And the report transmission screen is not displayed in most cases.

I have already permanently disabled  ""hardware acceleration"" and have done all of these multiple times, numerous times.
It's undoubtedly Firefox built in security devices that are causing this block. Chrome does not cause this, but there are other reasons not to use Chrome unless I have to, which is what I now have to do because of Firefox hyper-intrusive ""security"" software. If I could disable all the security bloat in Firefox, I would do so. It's just impossible. It does on month after month, year after year. We are prisoners of these device builders!

1.	Why are the vast majority hidden in Firefox Tools&gt;Add-ons?
2.	What do these unwanted, secret add-ons do (here are a few: ebay (1.0), Amazon (1.1), Twitter (1.0), Bing (1.0), Wikipedia (1.0), Duckduckgo (1.0), Google search (1.0), etc)?
3.	Do they/can they spy on me?  (some probably do, as some are listed as ‘reporters’ (e.g., Firefox monitor (3.0),  Web Compat (5.0.2), WebCombat Reporter (1.1.0), etc)
4.	Do I have a choice?
5.	How much do they slow down Firefox?
6.	Why do they return after I delete them using 3rd party software?
7.	Why doesn’t Firefox allow me to delete them within Firefox?
8.	What is going on here and why wasn’t I told?

I use Altiris (Symantec Management Agent) to deploy Firefox. I keep having a problem where Altiris will have the updated version of Firefox, and then a minor update to Firefox is released and it breaks Firefox.  Like right now we have 68.0.1 packaged, and 68.0.2 just came out and Firefox automatically updates to that. Firefox won't work when Altiris installs 68.0.1 because of the detection check looking to see if Firefox 68.0.1 is installed, but it doesn't so it installs 68.0.1. Firefox then says that I'm using an old version and need to make a new profile and I lose my bookmarks, internet history, and logins. We would like to prevent this from happening.

Having spoken to the credit card issuers, it looks like Firefox blocks the outgoing request for authentication since neither MasterCard nor Visa had any record of a transaction being attempted or authentication being requested. Consequently, the authentication window stays open for ever with nothing happening. I have already alerted my MasterCard issuer, a major retail business, in the hope that their complaint to Mozilla will carry more weight than mine. In the meantime, I wonder if anybody knows of a tweak or change of settings that may resolve this problem until Mozilla role out a fix.

Only way to close the window is to go to the Windows 10 taskbar and select the window to close it from there.  A screen shot is attached.

I suspect this problem is related - on the primary window, the work ""File"" is blacked out ... looks like a depressed black section of the menu bar.

How is this possible, if my account is already active?
Sure it's scam, but it doesn't happen if my account already exist.

The only thing that loads properly is Chrome incognito. I think this has to do with security settings, but what I see doesn't match any of the articles on the support website. I don't even know what to turn off to load these sites properly. For example, I can't see the videos on <a href=""http://tasty.co"" rel=""nofollow"">tasty.co</a> except for the homepage. Please help me manage my privacy settings.
