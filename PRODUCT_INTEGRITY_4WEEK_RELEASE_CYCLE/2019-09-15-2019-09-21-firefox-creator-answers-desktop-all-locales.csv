I've tried every ""quick fix"" I've found online, to include refreshing, sfc /scannow, disabling extensions, re-installing firefox, running malware scans, etc.  This started after a cluster of windows, firefox, NVIDIA updates about a week ago, and I haven't been able to pinpoint the source of the issue.  So far the only thing that brings the browser back to full speed is restarting my computer with an offline Windows Defender scan.  It never actually finds anything, but when the computer restarts Firefox works at regular speed until it is locked for a couple hours or restarted.  Any thoughts?

I also had print omissions of parts of web pages earlier today with a financial site, and that had nothing to do with pictures. Someone, I think on FF Support, once told me that FF was never intended as a full service browser, and so printing is a weak spot, apparently around page transitions in printing. True? If true, will that ever likely change? I would like to use only FF for security reasons, but I often have to use other browsers for printing, and it would be great if I could just stay on FF.

I already have a discussion going about this with AOL owning Netscape accounts and needles account ""verifications"" for a cell phone when I log in.  Again, another discussion.
So anyhow, I see this ""Syncing..."" message appear on my PC's web page.  But wait, I don't have a device to ""sync"" to - right?  So I go to the ""Options"" area and ""Disconnect"".  My theme resets to FF default and, you know all those icons for websites that are attached to your book marks as long as you have been there and the site provides a little pic?  All dumped.

</p><p>I almost gave up using it, but then found the refresh function. The first time I did this, it sped things up nicely and I retained everything. Within a week, Firefox slowed down again. So, in frustration, I reset it again. This time it did strip all my settings and saved them in a folder on the desktop.
</p><p>I have seen the solution that things can be copied from this profile folder into the new profile folder. 
</p><p>However, I have to say that from a usability perspective, this is a real fail. To ask users to selectively copy files even once is just a pain in the ass. To expect them to do it once a week (at least) in order to keep Firefox running crisply is ridiculous.
</p><p>I implore the Firefox team to come up with a better solution to help users keep Firefox running smoothly. I know it's complicated and that add ons are the real issue. But there's got to be a way to make this process more user friendly. Even just a notification when the browser senses itself slowing down that points to a well written, step by step troubleshooting guide would be good. 
</p><p>Or perhaps a refresh that disables addons but keeps the rest of the data. That might help people more quickly realize that an addon is causing the slow down (assuming that is the case).
</p><p>I don't know what the best solution, but there has got to be a better way than refreshing, losing all data, and then being expected to selectively copy information into a profile!

(It chooses a consistent one from some older bookmarks I have... let's call it ""random"" as there's nothing special about that older bookmark, but it's mostly consistent (more below on that.).  
</p><p>If I drag from the URL line to the DESKTOP (or from a Bookmarks toolbar folder of links) it will have a different icon. The icon is again generally consistent but again random in that it has no relation to the item being linked.  I can't seem to figure out what condition causes one or the other.  Note that every once in a while it will also give me this alternate icon for a URL dragged to the menu/toolbar. Once it's done that, that will forever be the icon for that link - even if I delete the link and start over. Sometimes it gives me the Firefox default icon (when it should give me a favorite from the site) but that's in a few cases. Once again, I can't seem to figure out what condition causes one or the other (or the other). 
</p><p>If I look at the Library pull down tool/menu of ""Recent Highlights"" it will be correct. However, if I look at the Library -&gt; Bookmarks under Recently Bookmarked it will generally be wrong. Sometimes it will be correct in both but continue to give me the wrong icon (Firefox default) when I drag it from the URL line or Bookmarks menu to the desktop. 
</p><p>If the very FIRST thing I do is to Bookmark this Page upon arriving, it all works normally. But if I drag the URL first before doing that, I get the errant behaviors above.  Some can eventually correct by deleting and using the Bookmark this Page feature but generally they retain some errant behavior.  There is no consistent workaround that works (at all) or consistently. 
</p><p>Note that the correct favorite icon appears in the TAB header, so it's not an issue with fetching the correct icon or there being one supplied by the web developer. 
</p><p>This has been going on for a while... a month or more. It's probably related to an update but I can't tell you which specifically as I usually do them as a matter of course when they come out. I don't know if it was there in 67.* but it's been there in 68 and it's in 69. I've been through many reboots, full shutdowns, even an unrelated hardware swap of the disk drive to a different (but identical) machine, etc. It's not a transitional problem.

</p><p>I am having bit of a problem with the cookies in the latest Firefox 69 and the 69.0.1 update that I had just now.
In the Firefox I had Cookies and site data permissions set to allow specific sites for the current session and now after the update looks like those cookies are getting blocked... I always have been using private mode and I had disabled all the cookies.
Looks like a bug, right? I think I could try add exceptions to the Content blocking, but then again, other stuff apart from cookies will be allowed.
Running browser in the safe mode gives same result.
</p><p>I would appreciate some help to resolve that issue.
Thank you.

Trato de pasar los marcadores del antiguo al nuevo y llevo dos días intentándolo y nada.
En el viejo creo el archivo html siguiendo las instrucciones de Mozilla de ""exportar"", sin problema, lo abro y se ve que contiene información y que corresponde a los marcadores. Lo paso via pendrive al nuevo pc, sigo el proceso para importar marcadores y no me hace nada.

I noticed yesterday that my bookmarks were all jumbled and out of place. My folders were no longer nested but all unorganized. Fortunately, I had a backup, so I restored it, only for it to get jumbled again. So, I signed out of all devices, selecting to delete everything. So, I imported my backup, and everything is fine. I logged back into Firefox on the computer that I imported the backup to, and again, everything was screwed up. 
</p><p>So, signed out again, chose the option to delete everything and restored the backup again. That is where I am right now. I am thinking something is corrupt with my account, but I do not know how to fix it. I was hoping that someone could help me. I have looked through the support documents, but I have yet to find one that helps me. I am running Windows 10 on four computers, Linux Mint on one and three Raspberry Pies with Raspbian. I also have two Android phones. I have had this setup for quite awhile with no problems until now.

1269026,2019-09-17 14:41:47 -0800,2019-09-18T00:30:44Z,"Firefox frequently stutters, lags, and results in severe input delay","<p>This has only been happening for about a week or so, but it seems to be getting gradually worse and worse to the point where I'm considering just using another browser. Basically what is happening is that whenever I'm using Firefox, it will very frequently stutter/lag. And by ""frequently"" I mean once every 2-4 seconds. This stutter hangs for about another 1-2 seconds before any inputs I attempted will suddenly and quickly catch up.
</p><p>For instance, if I'm typing (like I'm doing with this description) it will regularly hang as I type for about a second or two. I can still type while it is hanging, but nothing will appear on the screen until it finishes its stutter, then it will suddenly just display everything that I typed.  
</p><p><br>
-Important note: When I say ""hangs"" I don't mean in the tradition sense where the browser goes unresponsive. The browser does not freeze. In the case of me typing in a text box, the cursor still blinks as if it is waiting for input. If I'm watching a video, the video will continue to play, etc. What is ""hanging"" is literally my ability to input anything.
</p><p>Another example: Scrolling. I'll attempt to scroll, then it will hang for a moment, then quickly jump to the location it 'should' have scrolled to. 
</p><p>This goes for literally any input. And Like I said before, it seems to be getting worse and worse gradually over time. It started as a negligible little hiccup that happened randomly. Then it got more frequent and more pronounced. Now I can't even type a full word without it lagging out. Just earlier I was watching a youtube video and tried to click my mouse to pause the video... but the video didn't pause for a full 3 seconds until after I clicked my mouse.
</p><p>Things I have done so far:
</p>
<ul><li>I made sure I was using the most recent version of Firefox (69.0)
</li><li>I downloaded chrome to test if that gave me the same issues. It did not. Everything worked super smoothly. 
</li><li>I looked at the resources Firefox was using in task manager and Firefox uses about 530mb of memory, and hovers between 4-11% of CPU usage.
</li><li>I have already attempted a restore for Firefox, which did nothing to fix the issue.
</li><li>I've made sure my graphics drivers where up to date.
</li><li>I've disabled hardware acceleration in the settings.
</li></ul>
<p>I've been using Firefox for over 12 years now and I really don't want to switch browsers... but I don't know what else I can do.

In the past I have usually just ignored this prompt when I didn't want it to do either and usually it has been ok.
</p><p>Every once in a while however, Firefox just decides to create a new saved address without my telling it to and without telling me about it.  Then on some future website when I go to fill out a form, I will suddenly find that I have what look like duplicate choices because Firefox only shows the list for the current field plus a little more data which may or may not show what is different.
</p><p>The most recent instance, Firefox created a duplicate of my name, address, email, phone, etc. The only difference was that the new address included data in the Organization field.  It took me while to notice it because most online forms don't have anywhere for the Organization to go.  I only noticed the extra address when Firefox used it as part of my mailing address when I placed an order online.  Then I had to think to figure out where Firefox had gotten that 'Organization' -- I realized that I had typed that phrase on a website form a few days earlier, but certainly not in any field labeled ""Organization"" and I certainly didn't tell Firefox to save it.
</p><p>I need to use autofill to fill out online forms -- There are several forms that I fill out once a day, but I also use autofill to fill in my name and address on a lot of other online forms where occasionally I need to type in some of the data.  This seems to be when Firefox just decides it ought to keep whatever it saw me type.
</p><p>I like Firefox and have it as my default browser, but I have noticed that Chrome and Opera both do a better job of filling out online forms

Going along with that, I've gotten the ""We just need to restart FF"" page many times also.  Then, instead of actually restarting, I get the dialog forcing me to create a new profile, which it then runs.  Then I have to find the profile list, start a browser with my real profile (which I've carefully saved at this point), and then kill off the instance with the new profile.  I can't figure out how to get out of this cycle.  I've turned off automatic updates, but something  (??) still seems to be updating automatically.  When I check the app contents, I can see that some files/dirs have last-modified times corresponding to the update times on the support page, so something really does seem to be happening.   The contents of updates.xml seem a bit strange to me, BTW, but I don't know how to parse the entries very well - see image below.

</p><p>Hace unos días visité una sitio web y al entrar me apareció el mensaje 'Advertencia: riesgo potencial de seguridad a continuación', acepté los riesgos y continué navegando. El problema es que ahora cada vez que entro no me aparece ese mensaje por lo que creo que esa página se ha añadido a alguna lista de páginas de confianza o algo así (no sé lo que hace el navegador cuando se le da a aceptar) y me gustaría eliminarla para que me vuelva a aparecer esa advertencia.
</p><p>Saludos

On one in particular - <a href=""http://theguardian.com/uk"" rel=""nofollow"">theguardian.com/uk</a> - embedded video content will not play. The sound will, but the picture won't. I've done seemingly everything - disable hardware acceleration, messed about with tracking, blocking, permissions, extensions, plugins, reset that site, refreshed Firefox. Nothing works. I've been using Firefox happily for over a decade, but this is severely testing my faith and allegiance. I'm using a 2019 Mac, but Apple say it's not their problem. The protracted steps I had to take to even get to this page on this forum have seriously tested my patience. Please, Firefox - how can I fix this?

However it does not make any sense to be on a paid  movie site and attempt to search for a movie there and have it Binged or Googled over the internet.  This is piracy of your keystrokes and should be outlawed.  The fix is to double click on the sites search to keep it there. What a pain.  I wish some one would start a new OS so I don't have to be ripped off with my data.  Let's get a black box that will trap the data at the home network.

IE and Google chrome on this PC also do not experience the same issue.  I  cannot pin this to any Windows update(s) or other software installation(s) or updates.  How can I fix this and continue to have all the same tabs open up on my home startup without getting this frustrating delay as well as not getting the delays when going from tab to tab?
