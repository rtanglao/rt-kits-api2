I have an iMac, OSX Yosemite, version 10.10.5 and have been streaming MSNBC with no problems until 2 days ago, right after recent Firefox Update. Am now watching fubo tv on Chrome. Any ideas?

I tried DNS flush and tried a different DNS server, I tried resetting the modem and router, checked the PC's date and time settings, ensured that no parental controls were enabled, ensured that JavaScript was enabled, removed all Firefox extensions, restarted Firefox in safe mode, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and still have the same problem.

When trying to access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website, the page buffers for several minutes and then the page display's the error code PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR.  Sometimes I get an auto-update message on my Firefox browser that states that a new version is available and so I click to download the new version and all I get is buffering and no downloading.  Then a new message appears after a few minutes stating that Firefox didn't download correctly and that I need to reinstall Firefox.  I uninstall Firefox but cannot access any <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> website to reinstall Firefox because after clicking the link to access the Mozilla webpage there is nothing but buffer and no access.  Using the free online web based VPN I was able to reinstall Firefox, but I still have to same issues.  If I run Windows 10 in safe mode with networking I am able to access all <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> websites and install Firefox extensions.  Is there any known fix to get this issue fixed while running my PC in normal mode apart from completely uninstalling and reinstalling Windows?

I study on an online platform, which has different multimedia resources (videos, images, etc.) and also offers a Flipbook (which is something like an interactive online book, I guess). Every time I try to open this flipbook (it opens another window, which is normal) Firefox crashes instantly. 
I've tried everything within my resources, but I'm far awar from a tech geek =(. So far I've disabled content blockage and all my extensions (privacy bagder and uBlock for the website) and nothing seems to work.

</p><p>Alguém aqui entende um pouco do banco de dados do Firefox?
Eu falo do banco local, padrão SQL-Lite.
É que pretendo juntar o Histórico de vários perfis diferentes numa única base de dados.
O arquivo ""places.sqlite"", que fica na pasta raiz de cada perfil deve armazenar esse histórico.
Como ""appendar"" todos os registros num único banco?
Caso haja algumas duplicidades, qual o comando SQL para removê-las?
</p><p>Tenho também instalado o SQLiteBrowser.
O que me falta é a familiaridade com a manipulação de registros nos bancos.
</p><p>Explicando melhor, eu não pretendo sobrepor arquivos em pastas. Todos os arquivos das pastas de perfil ficarão intactas. Eu não quero abrir essas tabelas no Firefox. Até poderia depois de ""appendar"" tudo, mas essa não é a intenção. Eu queria apenas juntar todos os históricos e favoritos num único banco e remover as possíveis duplicidades.
Para isso, eu preciso conhecer os comandos SQL para manipular direitinho esses arquivos, com ""append"", com ""purge"", com ""index"", etc.
Por não dominar o SQL, procuro alguém que entenda mais do que eu para me dar o caminho.
</p><p>Não estou bem certo, mas parece que o arquivo favicons.sqlite também deve ser envolvido nas manipulações.
Vi que são inúmeras as tabelas de um de outro.
Eu teria que escrever comandos SQL para dividir os bancos mês a mês.

1. Sometimes, all my tabs in Firefox just won't open or load incredibly slow. I can go open them on Chrome and they load up real quick, so it's not a website or connection issue.
2. I use a lot of different Google sites. I'm not totally sure what I did. I think I wanted Google search to be different from work related admin tasks. Anyway, if I open <a href=""http://admin.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">admin.google.com</a>, it totally freaks out. First the tab starts swapping between purple (Google Search) and orange (Work). Then it starts opening tab after tab after tab until I have to force Firefox to shut down. I guess I need to go in and edit settings for some of the containers, but I don't see how to do this?

Am running the latest version of win 10, latest version of firefox - no errors comingo to disable all installed extensions and allow them one by one - nothing affected that problem.
</p><p>I am at my wits end and hop that someone much smarter than me has a simple solution. This is definitely one of those ""stump you"" things never encountered before.
</p><p>Appreciate any help.
</p><p>Even got a new keyboard, just in case, nothing, same problem.
</p><p>The only time where there is no problem, is when I use the most forefront firefox browser window - like right now, I am posting this with.

I am asked which application to open the download in - only APTurl is listed, so click 'Open Link'. After a few seconds a message comes up ""Package 'adobe-flashplugin' is already installed"". The only option is to close it. Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?

and, when you tell me how, is it possible to delete everything except what i have bookmarked/pinned to new tab?

</p><p>I have recently updated my PC with a new RAM and a new SSD (the old hard disk is now the secondary repository) and I have installed Windows 10 on it. However, I have a very particular problem: all browsers crash after a few minutes (if not seconds) after I launch them. I can play with no problems some games on Steam, but browsers - which should be much easier to run - crash. Starting from yesterday, also other programs are crashing from time to time.
</p><p>I share with you my specs
OS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (fully updated to the latest version)
CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 965 (sometimes it goes beyond 60°C for a few seconds, but not during crashes)
RAM: 2x8 GB DDR3 1,600 mHz (dual channel)
Motherboard: ASUSTekM4A87TD/USB3
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 (Asus Rog Strix version)
SSD: 465GB Crucial CT500MX500SSD1
HHD: 931GB Hitachi HDS721010CLA332
</p><p>I also share a crash ID: bp-a9c808c6-3f2f-4364-b716-b018c0190730
</p><p>I have tried replacing the new RAM with the old one (2x2 GB) with no effect at all.
Needless to say, all drivers are updated (GPU drivers through GeForce Experience software).
</p><p>Hope you have some suggestions!
</p><p>Thanks a lot!

After 12 sec, the page becomes back to normal. This is specifically happening when we accessing that control for first time. When accessing subsequent times, it works normal. We thought its due to volume of data, that is bound to the control. But its not. Its happening for drop down with 1 or 2 items. After analysis, we narrowed down that it is due to huge DOM content (13K nodes in DOM) loaded in initial page load. So, we cut down nodes to 7K and found minor improvement in page responsiveness. 
</p><p>This functionality is working fine in Firefox browser up to version 54.0, with DOM size of 13K nodes. Post v54 up to latest v68, the problem started occurring that the page becomes unresponsive, when we select drop down. But, this functionality is working fine in Chrome browser without any lag with same amount of DOM loaded in it.

<p>New observation on 30-Jul:
</p><p>When firefox is launched, the browser is launched with Default browser profile and the profile data are stored in local folder path ""C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\3ozvc1f9.default""
</p><p>We observed that, if we delete all contents in default folder and launch the application in Firefox browser, the functionality is working fine, incredibly very normal &amp; fast. Again if we logout &amp; close browser window, open new browser window &amp; access application, the page freeze when we access the drop down control. Until we cleanup default folder contents again, the issue occurs. If we clean the folder content, access application, page works, log out &amp; login in same browser window, the issue does not occur.
</p><p>It appears that every time, we have to clean up default profile folder contents, if we access application in new browser window.

</p><p>We have tested this on Windows 10 and Mac OSs as well, and the issue remains the same with the latest Firefox versions. I came across similar(not exact) issues in the support forum but none of them were exact or even suggested any workaround / fix / rootcause. 
</p><p>Ask: Need to understand if something is broken in latest Firefox builds or is there any setting/extension that may bring backward compatibility. Please note that in other browsers, we don't see this problem.
</p><p>Edit: Uploaded non-working snapshot.

Sometimes it works for a secodn or two, displaying the start page but then it freezes the system, most times though even clicking the firefox icon to start the program makes the whole system to run aground. The former version of firefox runned fine and solved the problem by reinstalling version 65.

1265632,2019-07-27 20:28:19 -0800,2019-07-28T23:37:24Z,Closing separate FF instances without losing open tabs,"<p>I keep multiple tabs open in multiple windows. Firefox v67 has done a good job saving/restoring all of them each time I launch the program. When the browser informed me of the v68 upgrade, I allowed it to install. At first launch after the upgrade, I was presented with a single fresh FF window with no history and no options to restore previously closed tabs/windows.
I fiddled with it a bit... investigating options, closing/re-opening the browser, trying to see if there was anything to recover, including peeking into FF's disk storage, but to no avail.
I began opening new windows/tabs to rebuild my normal setup. After a couple of days, from within a non-browser app I launched a URL (like pulling up online help). In response to that system request, a separate instance of FF launched and this instance restored all of my original pre-upgrade windows/tabs!
And note these are separate instances (see attached photo of Process Explorer). So for example, I cannot drag a tab from a window in one instance and drop it onto a window in the other instance.
</p><p>So now the big questions:
What is the minimum amount of tab/window loss I can incur by shutting down each instance?
In what order should I shut them down?
When I re-launch after closing both instances, will FF only restore one set of windows/tabs?
And will it be from the most-recently-closed instance?

However, the console log routinely hides most of what I write to it. I can plainly see that, even though the script executes from the beginning, the log starts somewhere in the middle of the script execution, and vital information that I *NEED* is always cut off ""above the fold"".
</p><p>I would be willing to settle for:
1.) Seeing ALL the console log entries my script writes, not just the small subset Firefox decides to show me
2.) Logging to a file instead of the console
3.) Using a remote logging service, if there is a free one that works (IE not Loggly). 
4.) Running a webserver on my computer and logging via remote calls to that
5.) A way to use JSON.stringify to append the log to tags in the open web page... I actually had this working, but Firefox logs objects as ""[object object]"" so I can't see them. I already know they're objects, I need to see what they contain!
</p><p>Any of these would work for me. I just need to be able to look at the log and see the order the various parts of my scripts executed in. 
</p><p>What would NOT work for me is:
</p><p>1.) Using the script debugger. The problem I'm seeing is very sporadic, and my script uses jQuery, the amount of javascript that executes very quickly is really large, so manually stepping through script execution would require literally hours or days of tapping away, without even being sure the error will occur for me to see. I really need to just be able to use the web normally, and then, when the error occurs, being able to look at the log and see the script execution documented exactly as I set up my console.log commands to do. 
</p><p>The fact that I just spent the better part of two days unable to find a simple solution to the problem of just viewing my script's log entries, is making me think Firefox is not an adequate browser for javascript development. Am I making a mistake trying to develop on Firefox? Is Firefox no good for troubleshooting javascript on?
