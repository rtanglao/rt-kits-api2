1268823,2019-09-14 10:49:52 -0800,2019-09-14T11:57:11Z,Composing gmail - unwanted line breaks in FF 69.0,"<p>I had posted another question here about 69.0 being the genesis of bad line breaking, and now a new thing I discovered.
</p><p>In Firefox - and only firefox - if I'm composing a new message, pressing enter generates a single line break as I'd like and expect - new paragraphs require two ""enter"" presses.
</p><p>EXCEPT, since 69.0, if I include a bulleted or numbered list in the message, when I end the bullets or numbering, the text below it inserts a forced double space with every ""enter"" press.  That is, single-spacing before the bullet/number list; double-spacing after it.
</p><p>Here is a ""selection source"" of a short message I composed:
</p>
<pre>=======
&lt;div id="":ol"" class=""Am Al editable LW-avf tS-tW tS-tY"" hidefocus=""true"" aria-label=""Message Body"" g_editable=""true"" role=""textbox"" aria-multiline=""true"" style=""direction: ltr; min-height: 376px;"" tabindex=""1"" contenteditable=""true""&gt;
Before the bulleted list line 1&lt;br&gt;
</pre>
<p>Before the bulleted list line 2&lt;br&gt;
</p><p>Before the bulleted list line 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet list line 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet list line 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet list line 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bulleted list line 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bulleted list line 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After the bulleted list line 3
</p><p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=======
</p><p>If you notice, the ""enter"" generated a &lt;br&gt; before the list, then a &lt;p&gt; after it.  Highlighting the lines after the bullets and removing the formatting (the slashed-out T in gmail compose) changes their selection source to:
</p>
<pre>=======
After the bulleted list line 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the bulleted list line 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the bulleted list line 3
=======</pre>
<p>As you see, the &lt;p&gt; is replaced with a &lt;br&gt; and the unwanted blank lines can be edited out.
</p><p>This was fine until this month when 69 took over.
</p><p>I'd like to see it put back to how it was in 68.

My problem is that after updating to version 68 and later, 1080p 60 fps videos in YouTube stopped playing properly. The audio works fine, but there are a lot of dropped frames. In fact almost all frames are dropped. I used to have Firefox 62.0.2, and then directly updated to version 68. Currently I run version 69.  Please note that this problem does not occur with Firefox version 62.0.2 (I reinstalled it and checked the same). I noticed this problem only with 68 and later. Also, this problem does not occur in Chrome, or any other browser for that matter. Moreover, this problem is only with 1080p 60 fps, because 720p 60 fps or even 1080p 30 fps work just fine. I have tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned in Mozilla Support articles, including clearing cache, disabling extensions, using safe mode, refreshing Firefox, reinstalling Firefox, using a new profile, and updating Firefox. None of the steps have worked. I ardently request someone from the Mozilla community to help me. This is the first major bug I've faced individually. If this is not fixed, I have to go back to an older version of Firefox till an update probably fixes this.

Please confirm,"<p>I brought up the Firefox browser, went to the Drudge report, clicked on a news story, and instantly I got a orangeish red page claiming my browser was infected, call this number immediately for support. My computer is being hacked, or something to that effect, and my bank account files are being stolen. 
OK, I tried to close the page, but everything is dead, as in a fake page. Seen these before long long time ago so in order to close it I brought up Task Manager and closed the process tree.  Reopened the browser and it was instantly there again. Closed the browser with task manage and ran a McAfee virus scan, CCleaner, and CleanMyPC. Tried again, same result. Checked windows update, same result. Everything is up to date. 
</p><p>I then called Verizon to confirm the phone number that it was trying to get me to call and Verizon confirms it belongs to Mozilla Firefox support. That seemed odd to me given the type of screen I'm dealing with is a scam screen that cannot be closed nor left unless you close Firefox with task manager.
</p><pre>Took a chance and called the number, gets an error message instead as in the number is no good. Double checked the number and is the same one that Verizon had just told me goes to Mozilla Firefox support. 
</pre>
<p>In case you're interested in that number: 833-830-7966
</p><p>I then started Firefox in safe mode. Nothing works there anyway, but no scam page loaded. Closed and went back to regular Firefox and now everything is working normally. At least at this moment. 
</p><p>Questions:
1) Any idea what happened?
2) Is that 833-830-7966 number a legitimate Firefox support number?
3) If that number is not legitimate then why is Verizon confirming it belongs to Firefox support? 
</p><p>Please advise and please give me all the details you might have so I can deal with this if it happens again.

In the settings for Firefox it says that my browser is being managed by your organization. But it has no mention of any settings being restricted, and when I clicked the notification to check the policy the page was entirely empty. I also checked the Firefox program folder and there wasn't any sign of an Autoconfic file that I could notice. One user mentioned on Reddit that this issue is often caused by antivirus companies forcefully inserting their own SSL certs to intercept your encrypted traffic, he then suggested turning off ""web scanning"" but my antivirus (which I only use Malwarebytes and Windows Defender) already had them disabled. After doing some research on my own I found out that the antivirus Avast used to cause this issue, and I had uninstalled Avast a while back, so I figured that the reason that the policy wasn't there was because Avast was uninstalled, but, I never saw this notification before today. So if anybody can help me pinpoint what this is and how remove it would be much appreciated. But all I really want to know if is this is something that I should be worried about or is it simply a bug. Also one other question is why the top sites and search bar is really close to the address bar after the latest update. Is this just a design change? Or is this something I need to be concerned about? Because I didn't notice this on Firefox on my laptop. Thanks in advance.

I know which I created but 1) someone hacked into my email and 2) when I went to log in to of course change passwords, I see this user name I did not create. Something like Gina2659 -- I see it show up but I put in the real name, 
How did this come about? I did not create that. 
How do i get rid of it? 
Is there a way to get firefox to unremember it? I would appreciate un-doing it.
Also, most important, someone of course accessed my email because a folder was created that I DID NOT CREATE and it was a ""send"" folder when I have a sendmail folder. I have no idea for how long, probably not long, but there were emails I sent months ago, MONTHS AGO LIKE MAY that I saw in that folder. I got rid of the folder and of course went through the process of changing passwords to my email, and am going to change this one, too.
</p><p>Another issue: I do NOT EVER want a password for everything. How do I check to be sure this is not the case with the mozilla password I have? When I see the ""you did it! your signed in"" and then get firefox everywhere else"" Does that mean this password is used for other things in firefox? I only want a password for the browser which should also be used to get help, whether they call it firefox or mozilla. I think the one password that opens all is insanity. That is what google does. This is why I don't ever use chrome anymore. 
It is why I make sure to change my gmail password every month.
Why I cringe at even having to have it in my smart phone and why I will never gt another android phone.
I appreciate your help and insight.
(I ASSURE ALL, there is no way I created that folder, and NO WAY anyone else could have because I am utterly careful and NOBODY else can use this notebook unless they hack in.)
I think this happened around the time a week ago I first saw that ""user name"" gina6598 whatever. NOT my creation.
thanks,
Gina

I am trying to assist a customer with her issue of not being able to open PDFs in the online program that she needs in order to complete the submission. She was able to do this previously in Firefox but now cannot (she cannot do this in any browsers now). 
She repeatedly gets the message: ""The document you are trying to load requires Adobe Reader 8 or higher. You may not have the
Adobe Reader installed or your viewing environment may not be properly configured to use
Adobe Reader.
For information on how to install Adobe Reader and configure your viewing environment please

Is there anyone who knows about this problem who has any suggestions? She has the latest upgraded version of Adobe Pro 2017 so she is fine there. 
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Ahora tengo dos problemas:
1) ¿Cómo recupero las contraseñas guardadas en Firefox y las meto en otro Firefox de otro equipo?

</p><p>2) ¿Cómo recupero los favoritos?
¿Dónde están guardados los favoritos? Recordad que no puedo arrancar el PC y no puedo exportarlos. Tengo que entrar en el disco duro desde otro PC, navegar por dentro e ir a las ubicaciones donde estén guardados los favoritos. Copiarlos, y meterlos en el portátil donde tengo Firefox.

Firefox Sync appears to sync up my bookmarks and other settings and info between ALL devices AND profiles so no matter what profile/device I'm on, I see work related bookmarks/history and personal bookmarks/history all the time. Firefox Sync doesn't utilize the separation of profiles within an account.

I'd just want Firefox Sync to synchronize my browsing/bookmarks between devices but not between separate profiles. 
</p><p>Is this possible? I've looked everywhere for settings to be able to control how sync'ing between devices/profiles occur but can not find such functionality.

</p><p>This worked straightforward as expected for more than a decade.

1. Reinstalling Firefox.

</p><p>I'm old enough that I programmed my muscle memory for using laptops long before touchscreens and gestures..   I just don't get on with them, so my Touchpad is configured without ANY gestures..  you move the curser and click the buttons and that's it.   It gives me 100% reliable control...  well most of the time that's how it is.
</p><p>To scroll in firefox i click and hold the vertical scroll bar then slide it up and down with the pad.  I don't think about it..  it just happens,
</p><p>However in Facebook and Flickr when you do this madness ensues..  What's happening is the scroll bar seems to relate to the relative position of your desired view relative to the total length of the current page.  So when the page loads another 50% at the bottom your view point jumps, if it loads some more, it jumps again, and again and you lose where you were in the page..    
</p><p>What I'd like to do is change how firefox uses the scroll bar such that the page never jumps, I don't mind if I can't scroll beyond the last item of the original page length, I can release and re-click to scroll further.  I just want to stop the jumping.
