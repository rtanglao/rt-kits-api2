I go to a site and click the link to comment. I had no problem getting to that point before, now i get a message that says ""this page sin't re directing properly.""
WHY? 
I read that maybe i need to clear the cookies.
GLAD TO.
but I cannot  find out where they are to clear them out. I look all around in security, i look all around in general.
i am so sick of this happening. I have to go to my outbox to fetch the email.
You KNOW THIS IS GETTING TIRESSOME
this browser isn't working for me anymore. I don't find it helpful, i don't find it is protecting anything it is just a nuisance.
SO I AM LOOKING FOR OTHER BROWSER.
IF YOU USE CHROME YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A PERSONAL TRACKER, I'M SURE EVERYONE HAS READ THE NYT ARTICLE.A
SO I LOOKED INTO mozilla pale moon and then looked into reviews and came across this""
Why You Shouldn’t Use Firefox Forks Like Waterfox, Pale Moon, or Basilisk.......... and it goes on and on about each. I didnd't read about all because I just want a fast, responsive browser that isn't going to make me crazy.
it said good things about firefox quantum -- I DO NOT KNOW if that is what i have now, i don't think so, but I do not want any headaches, i never want to be blocked from a site over friggin' cookies nd not be able to quickly clear them out. 
and then it says this:
""Even if you don’t completely trust some of Mozilla’s business decisions, your browser is just too important to be left to a small community of enthusiasts. We think it’s best to go with a big project with a large number of developers that receives a lot of attention to security. That’s why we recommend against using these smaller Firefox-based browsers, and why we also recommend against using alternative browsers based on Google Chrome. Here are our concerns with some of the more popular Firefox alternatives...""
I haven't read on, but look, I if until i can find what i can live with, I would be grateful for some help in finding out HOW NOT TO MAKE THIS BROWSER HARASS THE HELL OUT OF ME BY BLOCKING ME FROM GETTING AN EMAIL, WHEN I BLOODY WELL KNOW CNN IS A FINE SITE, AND PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HUNT ALL OVER HOW TO CLEAR COOKIES, WHERE ARE THEY? I 
HAVE ALLOWED ALL THESE SITES EVERYWHERE I CAN SEE TO IMPUT EVERY SITE SO THAT THE BROWSER KNOWS THAT IS IT OKAY.
</p><p>I WOULD BE SOOOOOOOOOOOO GRATEFUL JUST TO FIND A WELL SECURED BROWSER THAT ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ME WANT TO SCREAM BECASUE i CAN'T GET TO A SITE I WELL KNOW IS FINE, AND NOT A BOUTIQUE BROWSER, BECAUSE I THINK I CAN WELL SEE WHERE ""A SMALL GROUP OF ENTHUSIASTS"" CAN BECOME DISRUPTIVE TO PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND AN EMAIL.
DOES ANYONE AT ALL THINK YOU CAN PLEASE HAVE A SUGGESTION? 
EVEN IF IT IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MOZILLA?
or GOOGLE.
THANKS AND I APPRECIATE  IT IF YOU CAN GRASP HOW IRRITATING THIS IS AND JUST TRY TO HELP......
THANKS AGAIN SO MUCH!

I works fine until I put my computer to sleep. It is not connection problem because everything other than videos work. And with other browsers, videos also work. This problem started to happen recently for no good reason  - no windows update or FF update that caused it.   Does firefox play videos on it's own or does it depend on some external components? Tab icon shows me infinitely  loading animation. However, when I open dev tools and network tab, it shows me that it's downloading 771kb, which is the correct size of that video. When I right click and choose view page source then I can also see the contents of mp4 file. So it looks like file itself is downloaded but there is some component that does not get notification.

</p><p>Hello,
</p><p>WebVR implementation in Firefox has improved significantly but still some bugs are prohibitive from using it reliably. More specifically, integration with SteamVR appears to be problematic. Here's a test scenario.
</p><p>How to replicate the problem:
</p><p>0) Ensure SteamVR is installed and operational, using a compatible VR kit.
</p><p>1) Visit <a href=""https://sketchfab.com/AliceVision/models"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sketchfab.com/AliceVision/models</a>
</p><p>2) Open one of the models and select the VR icon (bottom right).
</p><p>3) Once the 3D model is presented in the VR headset, close the 3D model from within the web page and return to the list of 3D models (main page).
</p><p>4) 1st issue: Notice that in the headset, SteamVR shows that it's waiting for the application (Firefox in this case) to respond. This should not normally happen, i.e. when Firefox has no content to present, it should present a default 3D scene, for example: a dome with a firefox logo in the middle. Also, if you click on the System Button on the VR controller, the SteamVR Dashboard pops up BUT it does not offer the option to disengage/disconnect Firefox from SteamVR. That keeps SteamVR locked into Firefox. If you wait long enough, you get the ERRORS shown in the attached images.
</p><p>5) Open another 3D model and click on the VR button. The new model should appear in the VR headset.
</p><p>6) 2st issue: The VR controller is not longer tracked by Firefox.
</p><p>I hope you find the above useful and easy to replicate. If you need additional information, please do let me know.
</p><p>Kind regards

I'm at work and wanted to access a single bookmark folder from my home computer. I tried to login to my firefox account through a WEB PAGE - hoping I could access a list of bookmark like I used to do back when XMarks was a thing, I did NOT click on firefox synch ! However, firefox somehow decided that it meant I wanted to synch and started messing everything up. It added all my home bookmarks to my workplace computer, ruined the history (merge), extensions and so on. So I told it to disconnect sync and remove the sync data.
Guess what ? It didn't just remove the data it just got from sync. It totally destroyed everything. Work bookmarks, gone. History, gone. Addons, all gone. It's nearly as if FF was a brand new installation.
I'm panicking right now.
Is there any way to go back ?

Surprise; FF just updated itself and needs to restart.... here was me thinking I had set it to notify me when there is an update, but it looks like a previous update removed that function. 
I suddenly found I couldn't open usable tabs, all I would get is a lovely message telling me FF had updated and needed to restart, but not to worry because it will restore my session!
Now, I had 3 sessions  open with each having 15-20 tabs, and they all had to be closed and reloaded... Oh well it looks like I don't have a choice so here goes...
I clicked restart and waited, it didn't restart!
Ok, so I have to manually do the relaunch thing, great, my 3 FF windows are returning..... But oh wow each tab has to reload, the udtube vids all returned to there start position, my DuckDuck search pages and are now blank!
So all told I lost about 10 minutes and some work because someone knows what is best for me and just went ahead and changed the browsers settings.
I get why this was done, I mean when ms started pulling stunts like this their users were all super impressed and heaped so much praise on them it was a little embarrassing... Oh what fun!

1264660,1563168847,1563222804,"I followed all the instructions in the article ""Recovering important data from an old profile,"" but when I open FF, there are no bookmarks and no history.","<p>At least, I think I followed all the instructions.  After I created the new profile, I went to the section that reads:
</p><p>Important: Firefox must be closed down while copying files between profile folders. Also, Step 1 refers to your ""old"" profile folder - the profile containing data you want to copy to a new profile. If you can't open a profile from within Firefox, see Finding your profile without opening Firefox.
</p><p>I found this instruction a little irritating—if in step one ""profile"" means ""old profile folder,"" then why not say so?   But the big problem is that, with the warning that Firefox must be closed down, I closed FF.  
</p><p>Then I came across this:
</p><p>Open your profile folder:
From the Help menu, choose Troubleshooting Information. The Troubleshooting Information tab will open.
Under the Application Basics section, click on 
Show in Finder
. A window will open that contains your profile folder.
</p><p>Well, these instructions forced me to open Ff again—but to my dismay, when I went to the Application Basics section, and looked at Show in Finder, it wasn't my old profile that showed, but my new one.   Since I only found my old profile picture in the first place by following the same instructions to go to Application Basics when I was told to make a copy of the old profile, which was at that time my current profile, I only got to that profile because it opened automatically—I didn't remember the path, so I don't know how to find it.   But since I did make a copy of it to my external hard drive, I opened my Old Profile from there.
</p><p>Then this:
Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click Quit Firefox.
</p><p>So I quit FF.  
</p><p>Then this:
Hold down the control key while you click on a file you want to copy and choose Copy.
Open the new Firefox profile folder.
</p><p>I found this confusing; why in the world would I be told to click on a file to copy before I was told to open the new profile?   And where WAS the new profile?   
</p><p>So I opened FF again, went to Application Basics, and then opened the new profile, then closed FF again.
</p><p>So I was once more at this step:
</p><p>Hold down the control key while you click on a file you want to copy and choose Copy.
</p><p>But it occurred to me that, rather than repeat this step for each individual item, why not just drag the first sub-folder from the Old Profile to the New One?   I tried that, but got a message saying that the folder was invisible, so I selected everything in that folder and just dragged it into the new profile.
</p><p>I clicked on everything in the second sub-folder in the Old Profile, but when I dropped the selection in the New Profile, I got a message saying that there were copies, so I stopped.   Since I didn't know why there were two sub-folders in the Old Profile, I thought that, in order to make sure that everything from the Old Profile Folder was in the NPF, I created two sub-folders in the NPF, one entitled ""0 untitled"" and the other ""O untitled 2.""   Then I selected and dragged everything that I had transferred from the first sub-folder of the OPF into the NPF *before* I had created sub-folders for the NPF, and I dragged them into ""0 untitled.""   Then I revisited the second sub-folder of the OPF, selected its contents, then dragged and dropped them into the NPF sub-folder ""0 untitled 2.""   
</p><p>When I got to the section ""Your important data and their files,"" I was a little confused, because at first I thought I had to transfer these manually because they were not in the OPF, so I searched for them, but when I selected the ""places.sqlite"" and tried to drag and drop it, I got a message asking whether I wished to delete the file from the Cloud—since I didn't, I didn't.   Finally it occurred to me that perhaps they were in the OPF, so I looked, and they were.
</p><p>The article ends without any instructions as to what to do once you have finished transferring files from the OPF to the NPF, so I simply clicked on FF, which opened without the data.   I closed FF, then shut down and restarted my computer, but when I opened FF, still no data.   
</p><p>I thought perhaps that I had been wrong to drag and drop, so I opened the copy of my OPF on my external hard drive, then opened FF again t the Application Basics so that I could open the NPF in the finder.  When the NPF opened, I was surprised to see that the two sub-folders no longer had the titles I gave them, but had rather the strange string of numbers and letters reminiscent of the names of the invisible folders in the OPF.   
</p><p>Should I create another new profile folder and then go through the laborious process of selecting one file, clicking copy, then going into the NPF, without the sub-folders, and then click ""Paste""?  If I do that for one sub-folder from the OPF, should I create a first sub-folder for the NPF, and then put all the laboriously transferred files from the first sub-folder of the OPF into the new first sub-folder of the NPF, and then repeat that process when I transfer the files laboriously one by one from the second sub-folder of the OPF into the NPF?
