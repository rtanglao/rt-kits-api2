1264253,1562710478,1562711286,AUTOFILL AUTOMATICALLY RESETS - FF USERS CAN NOT BLOCK AUTOFILL,"<p>I found a MAJOR FLAW in FireFox so they Steal all your info you type!
</p><p>I do not want my ""AUTOFILL"" being used, yet FIREFOX BUILT IN TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ON!
</p><p>I also use CC Cleaner and it exposed a MAJOR SECRET BUG IN FIREFOX and you can NOT TURN OFF AUTOFILL!
</p><p>The ""Fake"" autofill is reset to always be ON, and if you try to actually Block it, your FF will reboot back to AUTOFILL ON!
</p><p>You can got to Security and  select ""Autofill"" to be off, but its a FACT, IT STAYS ON!  A 2nd security program states the BROWSER PLUG IN is not Off but On!  When I manually turn it off with a 2nd program, it automatically closes FF and reboots back on with AUTOFILL ON!?
</p><p>So Once I turn on FireFox and my autofill in security says OFF, it actually stays on.  Looking at programs browser plugin in CCleaner, it reverts and says FF Autofill is ON!  When you try to clear it and change it to OFF, you FIREFOX Automatically CLOSES!  Then when you restart FF and look again, CCLeaner says its ON.
</p><p>I was wondering why I'd get the same stuff on pages, and I set my Security Autofill OFF.  So you ""assume"" its off, but if you look close, you'll see stuff you typed yesterday, is still valid.  Yet I reset all cookies and run CCLeaner and several other security programs.
</p><p>So why can't you actually TURN OFF FF ""AUTOFILL""?  Their is a SECRET that forces FF to keep autofill ON, even when you select it to be OFF!   
</p><p>Does anyone else find this scam on, where your computer catches FF Autofill being on, when you select it to be off?
</p><p>So all your typing in FF, you may select Autofill ""Off"", but your computer actually reads that Autofill IN FF as still being ""ON"".
</p><p>So is FF only ""Pretending"" to its users to think your ""autofill"" data is OFF, but ITS ACTUALLY BEING SENT?  If not, why is other security programs picking up on the Autofill typing being sent as ""ON"", inside the actual FF program?   Why would a computer security program reading FF, read the blocked autofill data as being ON, while your FF security controls say its OFF inside the FF Browser?  
</p><p>This opens up your computer to having all your typed data secretly stolen, and if you use your CC or bank info or passwords, they are really be SENT!  What a FF scam....  So was this purposely made or what?
</p><p>I never remember having any ""Autofill"" Plugin, until the last few months.  So is this a new addon, that they use to backdoor into FF and steal all your personal data?

I have been using Firefox on my MacBook since 2012, and been syncing to my Android phones since 2015-ish (a Huawei, then Samsung, then another Samsung, replacing them as they broke). I never had any problems. I can't remember if I was able to access already synced bookmarks from broken phones, but since I move my mobile bookmarks into desktop bookmark folders pretty often, I was never bothered enough to check. Last October, my MacBook's logic board broke. Not long after, my phone broke. I got a secondhand iPhone, and signed into sync, but nothing synced up. I assume because my devices are already dead and no longer syncing? Is there anyway for me to access my laptop bookmarks? I still have the hard drive from the MacBook.
</p><p>I finally have access to a computer again, this time a Windows desktop, and logged in to my Firefox sync to see if I could find any of my disappeared bookmarks. Nope, but something weird happened. I have about 200 bookmarks on my iPhone, and the first 139 migrated to the desktop. They show up under the 'Mobile Bookmarks' folder on the desktop, but I can no longer see them on my iPhone. The most recent 20 or so bookmarks are still available on my iPhone, but don't appear on the desktop. What just happened?
</p><p>While going through all the help pages, I discovered that I do have a second Firefox profile, though I opened it up and there isn't anything on it. Not sure if that matters.
</p><p>Thank you!

</p><p>I'm a longtime Firefox user and 62.0.3 works flawlessly on my Windows 10 PC. However, every version since then - and I've tried them all, right up to 68.0 - has been unstable. The browser hangs and/or crashes and every time reverting to 62.0.3 instantly fixes the problem. This is now quite an old version, though, and I'm concerned that by using it I'm exposing myself to security issues. Any ideas?
