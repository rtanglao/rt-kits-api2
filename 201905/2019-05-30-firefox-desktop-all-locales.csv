Since updating to 67.0 Quantum, and until last night, when I started FF, the toolbars showed up, but the main page was blank.  If I clicked on the home icon, my start page (<a href=""http://news.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">news.google.com</a>) loaded fine, and away I went. 
</p><p>Yesterday, in an attempt to fix the above, I uninstalled and reinstalled FF.  Since I did that, the following happens:
</p><pre>- Starting FF shows a completely blank page. 
- Pressing the FF icon on the taskbar so that FF minimizes and then expands shows the toolbar.
- Pressing the FF icon on the taskbar again as above loads my home page.
- At this point, I can access the settings menu, but clicking anywhere else on the page does nothing, until
- I press the FF icon on the taskbar to minimize and expand switches to whatever I've clicked on. 
</pre>
<p><br>
The same thing happens typing URLs in to the address bar. If I drag to highlight, I have to minimize/expand FF to show the highlighting; when I type in a new address, I have to minimize/expand FF to go to the new address - and I have to go through the same minimize/expand dance with the taskbar icon. 
</p><p>It's like I'm having to load individual frames of a movie, rather than the movie running smoothly.
</p><p>And, to make it even more fun, when I start with add-ons disabled, FF works fine.

I have refreshed multiple times with no success. 
I have disabled the few addons and extensions that are installed in my FF and restarted, with no success.

He's one of those kids that really has to work to write much, so he's *really* discouraged and it's worth some effort on my part to recover. Wix has no recovery tools I can find, and there is nothing in the disk cache. However when I fired up about:cache I did find several potentially interesting files in the ""memory"" section. When clicking on them, I get a page with the title ""Cache entry information"", a bunch of header info etc, and then a big chunk of what looks like hex data with checksums or something e.g:
</p><p>00000000:  1f  8b  08  00  00  00  00  00  00  03  ec  bd  db  92  1b  57  ...............W

etc...
</p><p>To complicate matters further the machine he was on is an old unstable one, so to capture the data before it died again (and presumably wiped the memory cache), I went through the cache and saved all of the likely looking files.
</p><p>Some of them are pretty big, so I am optimistic there is something in there at least, but I can't figure out how to access them. Naively it seems like there should be some way to get FF to interpret them as arriving from a server, rather than just displaying the data as text the way it does if I load the file. I've also tried editing out the decorative HTML from the cache file I saved and making a file that looks like a server response, using only the headers &amp; pre-formatted text from the cache file, but no luck. Any advice?
</p><p>thanks

1260567,1559207422,1559549423,"Firefox Awesome bar suggestions don't work, bookmarks won't add or delete (Fixed)","<p>I encountered peculiar behaviour in Firefox (Macbook Pro / High Sierra). The Firefox Awesome bar (address/search bar) stopped showing suggestions. It did show some suggestions but only after typing 'http://'. After weeks of torment I discovered that the problem wasn't limited to the awesome bar itself – the history and bookmarks stopped working properly as well. History ceased displaying recently visited sites (only the ones I visited weeks ago) while I also could not add or delete bookmarks ('Bookmark this page' and 'Delete bookmark' functions didn't do a thing). 
</p><p>I tried many fixes, starting off by googling for solutions. I tried clearing cache, disabling search suggestions and enabling them again under Preferences, reinstalling Firefox, resetting PRAM, updating my OS. None of the above fixes worked. 
</p><p>I fixed all the problems by following this guide on repairing faulty bookmarks: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cant-add-change-or-save-bookmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cant-add-change-or-save-bookmarks</a>
Removing the xulstore.json and places.sqlite files and restarting Firefox did the job, everything is working smoothly again. I'm sharing this in case there are others like me, who are searching for a fix to the awesome bar only and not to the bookmarks or history.

1260564,1559204651,1559318909,css not working on some sites,"<p>I had this problem for a bit now and most sites work but some DO NOT render the CSS properly.
At first I though it was a Firefox problem, but it turns out when I use IE I have the same results on some sites.
</p><p>This is on my main computer with Win7 Ultimate.  On my slow old netbook running Win7 Ultimate, everything works fine.
</p><p>FYI I have cleared, deleted, scanned everything.
Safe mode, same thing.
What in underlying system is running CSS rendering? 
</p><p>Any help appreciated.

But I was under the impression that if someone attempts to reveal my passwords, master password will be required. But putting master password every time i open firefox is too much inconvenient for me.

Since it just started today, I am wondering if something got an update that is messing things up.  I rebooted my computer, but that had no effect.  Any thoughts?  Thank you!
