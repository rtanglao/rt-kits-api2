Hello
I tried every support article that firefox has to offer regarding the issue, however none of them seem to be helpfull and apply to the issue.
Reinstall, safe mode, refresh had no effect. Troubleshooting windows drivers and reinstalling had no effect either. Firefox does show up in the soundmixer, and is not muted, however the tabs in firefox have no sound icon, so i assume they dont register any sound rather than being muted?

especially if there are a lot of tabs I want to simply save as bookmarks, and get on with something else,
I don't want to have to wait for every page to fully load - that could take ages and how will I know without eyballing everyone.  
(When I've only just sent them to OneTab, then reopened, why are they not cached but that's a different issue.)
</p><p>Recently I have been saving all bookmarks, then counting the open tabs vs the new bookmarks.
This is a dumb thing to have to do manually.
</p><p>Presumably the reason it is failing to catch all is due to them not having yet loaded fully or something.
</p><p>Ideally this can be fixed, but at least if I know what FF needs to successfully bookmark all open tabs (which it does do sometimes even before every single one has fully loaded), I can work around that functional shortcoming.

I'm using it to refer to the TAB key -- used not to move through browser tabs, but to move through tools in the Firefox window.
</p><p>I have frequently used the TAB key to move from the URL field to the Search field. Previously, this required using the TAB key only once, but with the latest upgrade (67.0), one TAB from the URL field goes to one of the other tools that I have between URL and Search fields. But I have no need to TAB to those tools. Is there any way, short of moving those fields around, to change the tabbing order so that I can go back to only needing to hit the TAB key once?
