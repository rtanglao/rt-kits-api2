I guess it deleted my youtube cookie because when I went to youtube I was asked to log in. When I clicked on the login button I got a dialog box asking me how I wanted to open an ajax file, presumably the script that youtube wanted firefox to run to handle the login process.
What's up with that? Why didn't firefox run the script so I could log in?
