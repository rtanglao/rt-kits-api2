My telecomprovider offers me regularly the invoice in pdf-format. When I download it, the filename is changed into 8 characters, not being a sensible or readable name (ie ""7fH5Rsd3.pdf""). When I asked the the provider to change this, it was clear it already is. Other customers working with IE or Chrome etc. don't have this problem. It was suggested this could be Firefox itself. The strange thing is this happens only with this provider and apparantly only with me. Everywhere else pdf's or any other file downloads just fine with their respective names. So, what could be the cause? One obscure setting in Firefox? Or should I look elsewhere? BTW: this is happening with all previous versions of Firefox, but I don't know when it started. </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1309152;1309204;1309727;1309735;,bankzilla

You are telling me:  ""This is not monitored for security through Mozilla's Recommended Extensions program. Make sure you trust it before installing."" How can I trust it if I don't know anything about it?? or if it is new? -Most of people here who are downloading add-ons are normal users like me, not people who understand codes and developing.- Read reviews?? Do I understand from you that some people have to sacrifice for us so the rest can know if it is bad or good add-on? And by the way Reading reviews is not enough, For example Few months ago I downloaded a VPN similar to another one, lots of reviews say it is good,  so I used it for maybe 1 month then I disabled it and stopped using it. Today I look at it in the disabled add-ons list, I find this message: ""VPN has been disabled due to security or stability issues."" I read more information about it, it turned out that it was executing remote codes....... That means I shouldn't even trust reviews!! Nothing happened to my firefox browser, but (it may happen) in the future, because of the already executed remote codes or or maybe those codes stole some information about me,....I don't know, but it may get worse who knows what those executed codes do..... </p> <h6 id=""w__2"">=============================</h6> <p>Now after I provided my (((important))) suggestion, I need an advice please what should I do now??

При этом окно с восстановленной сессией открывается тоже, с ним всё нормально. Характерно, что каждый раз, когда это всё таки происходит - это одна и та же пара сайтов. По-английски не смог сформулировать, но это самые обычные сайты, с ними не связаны какие-то расширения браузера, у них нет особых разрешений или чего-то в таком роде; они никогда не были стартовыми. Это началось довольно давно, и я не помню, чем я мог вызвать эту проблему. Иногда этой фигни не происходит неделями =\ Я пытался переустановить браузер с полной очисткой пользовательских файлов, но потом отсинхронил настройки через аккаунт Firefox и закладки через расширение ""speed dial"" - вместе с какой-то из синхронизаций вернулась и проблема. Я даже Винду за это время менял (с 7ой до 10 версии). </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1308975;,stigmated

When clicking on Firefox, no window opens and the cursor begins to rapidly flicker or spin. There is no error message given. When checking Task Manager, there are multiple instances of Firefox running. Trying to ""End Task"" on each instance proves futile because it seems that they are constantly refreshing (which is probably why the cursor flickers). Trying to run the command ""taskkill /f /im /firefox.exe"" sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, even in Administrative mode. The only sure fire ways to get the cursor to stop flickering and/or close the program is to restart the machine or uninstall Firefox. However, if Firefox is clicked on again after restarting, it goes back to flickering and no window ever opens. </p><p>Things I've tried: </p><p>1. Using ""End Task"" in Task Manager </p><p>2. Running CMD and using taskkill /f /im /firefox.exe multiple times. </p><p>3. Restarting the machine. </p><p>4. Clearing ALL temp files from the machine. </p><p>5.

The Sort-by-Name menuitem should be captioned ""Sort Toolbar by Name"". A new menuitem should be added to the context menu of the items within the folder, captioned ""Sort this Folder by Name"". Not only would this make more sense semantically, but it would simplify the steps you have to go through when adding a link to a folder, changing its properties, and resorting the links. Maybe someone can come up with better captions, but you get the idea. </p><p>For example: I drag a link to a folder on the toolbar. I then have to click to open the toolbar, find the new link, edit properties. To re-sort the folder, I have to the right-click on the folder (which closes it!) and choose ""Sort by Name"". Then, to see the results, I have to reopen the folder and find the link again!

Now initially everything would simply fit in the html, but later I moved the javascript portion into separate files. This all worked well, until I wanted to switch to using ecmascript 6 modules.

The only way my local file will auto-play is if the default for all websites is set to allow it, which is not what I want to do. </p><p>Is the problem something on my end that I can change?  Is an extension of mine possibly blocking this?  Would a reinstall help? </p><p>Edit: I would like to also mention that auto-play settings work fine when I access my local file through localhost (using something called WAMP).

Today, after calling my credit card company I was told that a glitch would require that I delete Eno and then reinstall it as an extension.

Now it is gone and I have been unable to find Eno as an extension (I am getting the sense that a recent change in either the extension or the browser or both has rendered them incompatible).  Big drag ... not a pandemic, I realize, but still a drag. Any suggested tricks to get it back?

What is wrong with words like, ""Menu,"" ""Submit,"" or ""Send""? This has been getting worse and worse over time. I don't know if the developers for FF are simply oblivious to the problems that they are causing or if they know but don't care. Gmail is worse but it seems like FF is following Google. What a horrible thing to do for accessibility, among other things. At least, though, Gmail on my phone can use the pinch technique to make the text larger.

I asked on the Zotero forum and got some suggestions that didn't really help. I don't think it is Zotero. Zotero is only showing up because it connects to our librayr system. How can I fix this?

This is my first ever attempt to get help, and I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. I noticed that Firefox now has a channel-app on Roku. But I only connect to my Roku Ultra streaming device using Ethernet. The Firefox browser which I use is located on my laptop, running Linux-Mint-Mate, distro 19 and it's also connected only by Ethernet to my network: My Roku device and my laptop are connected to the same Ethernet-only home network. The reason I cannot use wifi is that my wifi is too slow - Router is 16/4 and I think I'd need a new, much faster router 32/8, or better. But my laptop is very old and it's unlikely it can transmit wireless signals fast enough for a reliable HD signal anyway . . . I would like to be able to send streaming videos from my laptop, to my Roku Ultra - to my TV. (It is not a smart TV - it's just an old Panasonic Plasma HD TV). I have an NBC Sports Pass Gold - Cycling Pass subscription account which (because of their app's. limitations) cannot play all of the available videos from its Roku channel app, because their ROKU channel app's videos are limited to just the most recent 90-day posted events.  But all of the older videos from the earlier part of the season can always be played from their website, directly from my NBC account,  which is located only on my laptop. -So this means that I can only watch these older videos on my laptop. My Linux operating system is running on an older HP Elitebook laptop with a duel-boot setup with Windows XP.  If it is not possible to send these website-only videos across my network via Ethernet to my Roku Ultra device to my TV, could you tell me exactly what hardware devices etc. I would need to buy to do this successfully using wifi?  My wifi speed to my apartment is very, very fast - it uses Comcast's fiber-optic service.  Please note; I am only be able to follow very simple, step-by-step answers. I am elderly and I'm just a novice with computers etc.  Thank you very much for any help with explanations, and options that I might have to accomplish this.

(I apparently was not alone.) I immediately archived the most recent profile backup. I have tried a couple of times since then to figure out how to retrieve the OneTab data from the profile archive, but have always failed. I tried again this week, and am still failing. I contacted the OneTab development team via their website, but they never responded.

It is dated to March 25, 2019. I could retrieve entries from that file, but I would not recover the many tabs saved between March and October 2019. </p><p>This week, I uninstalled Firefox, set the current Firefox profile aside by renaming it, extracted the October 2019 profile to make it the current profile, went offline, installed Firefox 69.0.2, started Firefox, and displayed the OneTab overview page.

I also have Local Security Policy set to treat any connection as Public and cannot be changed by user. So what has changed from 73.0 to 74.0/75.0 that my firewall settings would now impede Firefox from allowing the microphone to work or even producing the popup permission query? Running Win 7 x64 all updated. I am image obsessed and they are all clean and updated with no programs on them. 73.0 and previous work fine with my firewall settings. Firefox-1.png shows 73.0 working properly with Hangouts Firefox-2.png shows 75.0 wanting to change firewall settings which doesn't help and no microphone query. </p><p>Thanks for any pointers.

I did a clean install of firefox and upon importing my bookmarks backup via html some bookmarks failed to update their icon even though it was showing properly on the tab. Even with an identical address it would still be a globe. I tried everything from refresh, clear history, deleting and changing the name of favicons/places sqlite. Nothing worked. Again, this was a clean install. All other firefox sytem folders were also removed prior to re-installing. Program files, appdata, etc. all deleted prior to installing.  </p><p>After trying some things with no luck I found out that If you import your firefox bookmarks to chrome and re-load the bookmarks in chrome the icon refreshed to the correct one. I did that for all missing icons. I then exported the bookmarks as html, but before I imported them back into firefox i completely removed history and all bookmarks once again, and then restarted firefox. </p><p>Once firefox opened I imported the bookmark html from chrome and sure enough it worked. The bookmark icons were back to normal. To test i reloaded the page and even restarted firefox and they were all still ok. There is def an issue in firefox that prevents bookmark icons from refreshing properly. Hopefully the team will take a look into this and get a patch to firefox.  </p><p>I already fixed the issue but I wanted to post here to report my findings in case this was a bug? For some reason I couldnt create an account at bugzilla either so thats why I am also posting here. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-750;desktop;windows-10;bookmarkicons;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",arugula

However, below and after the description everything including other seller photos and text are on the left side of the page.  Normally they are across the page from the left side to right side.  But now the layout is all on the left side.  Everything is against the left side only and very hard to read.  For many years I have never run into this problem before.  I signed off and restarted Ebay with same problem.  Looked at my son's computer and the ebay layout looked correct like like mine use to.  I also opened up my google chrome browser and signed onto ebay.  The ebay photos and text were correctly located on the page.

If I move Firefox to space 3, and close it (CMD+Q), the next time I'll launch it, the window will appear in space 3 no matter from which space I launch it. </p><p>Not my native language I hope I've been clear enough sorry. </p><p>And of course, when I right click Firefox on the dock, under Options, the value of ""Assigned To"" is ""None"". (already tried to assign it to a space then go back to none but it doesn't work). </p><p>This behaviour only concerns Firefox. All others apps behave like it should : open in the space I'm in..

I find I have to use an alternate browser to get to the connection page because Firefox refuses to load it. Basically, I get the message that I have to login to the network; I click the ""Connection"" button, and a page loads that tells me the wifi login page isn't secure. I click the ""Advanced"" link, and I can then either 1) Cancel, 2) View the Certificate, or 3) Proceed at my own risk. I choose 3, and Firefox does nothing. I click the link, and the link seems to be dead ... it literally just does nothing. </p><p>This is really annoying. I connect to this network daily. I understand the network isn't configured properly, but I'm not the admin and I can't do anything about it. I resent FF for preventing me from connecting while seeming to give me the opportunity to connect. I've tried changing settings in about:config, but nothing works. I end up loading Chrome just to get to the login page for the network, where I then connect, and then immediately kill Chrome and go back to whatever I was trying to do. It's so annoying I have considered just abandoning Firefox, but I've been using it since 2005 and really don't want to use Chrome. </p><p>How can I get around this behaviour and connect to the wifi network using Firefox?

I know that I can probably go in the printing setting to change it for that page and that might fix the problem. But for my project, I need to do this nearly 150 websites everyday. So fiddling around with every other website and Firefox print setting is not an option. I have attached a sample print to PDF to show the problem. When I print, half the content is hidden. In contrast, whenever I use Google Chrome, I never have this issue. The default printing settings just work, every single time in Chrome. I don't want to switch to Chrome because I want to support the Mozilla/Firefox mission. But the minor issues in Firefox are frustrating. </p><p>Between the lack of a translation tool that can translate the webpage and the poor default printing setting, I am nearly ready to switch. Firefox developers, if you're reading this, please fix this printing issue. While you're at it, please add an inbuilt webpage translation tool. Nobody want to copy and past webpages to translate them. I really want to stick with Mozilla, but you have to improve these little features within the browser.  </p><p>Actually never mind, cannot attach the pdf to show the issue in this forum. FANTASTIC (sarcasm)! Here is a sample screen shot instead.

All other programs are working fine, which might cast doubt on hardware/graphics issues. </p><p>ISSUE: When I make a new tab, whether with Ctrl+T or ""+"" tab button, or even Ctrl+Shift+T for opening a working tab I closed recently, the tab will be useless.  I know this will happen because either (a) the tab doesn't show the firefox new tab page, but a gray screen, (b) the address bar will not respond, (c) one or both of the previous, and a small yellow box pops up for less than a second that says ""a script is causing your page to slow down..""--this bar goes away immediately; I had to take a screenshot to read it.  There is no notification of a crash other than this brief bar.  Sometimes an existing tab will freeze, demonstrating the page until I scroll, whereupon new parts scrolled to of the page are just gray, and even old parts that have been scrolled off-screen come back gray, and the page is effectively an image since it's unresponsive, and even typing a new page into the URL bar doesn't do anything. </p><p>What makes this particularly disruptive is that by seemingly random chance and independent of the site being visited, the tab will be useless.  The tab can't be made to work again, it will be frozen until closed and another tab created.  This happens more than 50% of the time and either has gotten worse or more annoying to me over time.  Usually I will middle click a link ten times and open one of 1-3 tabs that worked.  Recently I closed several tabs but wanted to restore one, so I spammed Ctrl+Shift+T, but half the tabs were broken and irrecoverable (except through History). </p><p>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I reset firefox and updated everything for this post.  I have no addons installed, and the plugins are OpenH264 (1.8.1.1), Shockwave Flash (32.0.0.344), and Widevine Content Decryption Module (4.10.1582.2).  There are no recent crash reports in about:crashes. </p><p>Super looking forward to fixing this, the browser is unusable in its current state.

The style sheets supplied by modes simply provide the colors for that mode, and can be adapted in a very *straightforward* way.  Well.... </p><p>""To style the editor itself, it is possible to ALTER or override the styles defined in codemirror.css."" </p><p>Continuing: ""The easiest way to use CodeMirror is to simply load the script and style sheet found under lib/ in the distribution, plus a mode script from one of the mode/ directories. For example: </p><p>&lt;script src=""lib/codemirror.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""lib/codemirror.css""&gt; &lt;script src=""mode/javascript/javascript.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;"" </p><p>The only problem is, I can't find a detailed enough example (only ones like the college engineering professors worked, leaving out several key steps). </p><p>There weren't many posts in their community about how to make it use another theme than the Default, that's inside of codemirror.css in omni.ja.  A guy answering a question about this referenced the theme demo page, showing different themes on code.  Said maybe you can read the source files for  the demo page.  I read it, but I'm not sure it's applicable when embedded in Fx. </p><p>I've searched a lot how to do it &amp; there's not much info.  Honestly, unless someone advanced enough to look at their instructions could simplify it, it's possible the fastest way is change the  default theme colors in codemirror.css, then repack omni.ja.  Codemirror mentions that method, but again, I think they're talking if it's freestanding or backend for some text editor, not embedded in a browser. </p><p>I'm not sure userChrome will work because it's not really part of Fx.  At least I couldn't get it to work, putting the theme code in userChrome (either the normal or /chrome_debugger_profile/chrome).  Though some people change some things in devtools using userChrome.css.  It breaks when Mozilla changes anything.  </p><p>The very few things I had tweaked in CM / dev tools UI, stopped working in Fx 74.  Nothing I could do - a new profile, new userChrome file, copying a few rules - ever made it work in Fx 74.

Sometimes (25%?) of the time when you click the ""X"" box, they then fire off a pop up.  Now, this pop a) comes from an ad pretending to be a window and b) is a result of my mouse click.   So the fact that I can find the setting menu and turn on the pop up blocker is not helpful, as discussed in the appropriate support page:   </p><p>Is the pop-up shown after a mouse click or a key press? </p><p>Certain events, such as clicking or pressing a key, can spawn pop-ups regardless of if the pop-up blocker is on. This is intentional,        so that Firefox doesn't block pop-ups that websites need to work. </p><p>Is it a true pop-up window? </p><p>Sometimes ads are designed to look like windows, but really aren't. Firefox's pop-up blocker can't stop these ads.  </p><p>So what we have at last is a second-level question: now that we know the built-in pop up blocker is not the solution, is there one out there?  A plug-in perhaps?  Or perhaps soneone direct me to the forums and an appropriate discussion of (presumably NOT the popup blocker) the mechanism by which this is solved?   </p><p>Thanks for any courteous replies in advance, Craig </p><p>PS: Amusing contradiction here... how am I going to find the answers...   hmmm.... </p>",firefox-740;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1302458;1302601;,craigwbarzzz

Is there really not a Mozilla Firefox web blocker?
