I recently set this software to boot with OS.  </p><p>What I have noticed is that when, EVGA Precision runs Mozilla Firefox is the only app (games, other browsers and other apps) to experience this weird graphics glitch, this particular glitch is not very evident from the screenshot of Firefox below but if you look closely to the left side of firefox, you would notice that a blue rectangle extends from top to bottom covering up part of the web browser, this is purely isolated to this browser. What is not captured in the screenshot below is that this rectangular block of blue changes color frequently and seems to cycle through each color in the palette. </p><p>Over the past few days, the solution to my problem was to exit EVGA Precision, however this is no longer the case and with that I have no evidence to conclusively say that this is related to EVGA's software.

I've looked up a few fixes before posting and they didn't work: </p><p>- Tried booting FF on safe mode and it didn't fix the issue - it clearly isn't caused by an add-on (and I've never had this issue in my previous browser with nearly the same add-ons installed). - other people seem to have had the exact same issue multiple times and it's lasted for years, so it's clearly a problem on FF's end. </p><p>Here is the issue described more specifically: Copying things from a tab from FF and into the online version of Word does not work - when I try to, the intended selection:  - disappears a few seconds after I've pasted - or it does not appear at all - or when it does, it erases the entire sentence it was pasted next to it, which you can imagine is absolutely bothersome. </p><p>I've also tried to copy/paste statistics from a site called <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org"" rel=""nofollow"">archiveofourown.org</a> onto another FF tab. - What ended up being copied is only the last character of the entire content I was trying to paste, which I think suggests there's some issue with what's contained in the clipboard. </p><p>I'm mentioning these two websites because I'm guessing that something about them is probably conflicting with the copy/paste feature, however I'm hoping no one will have the gall to tell me it's those websites' faults and that I should just stop using them. </p><p>When pasting (while having hopefully copied the former selected content- and no, it wasn't the case), it always pastes the content which was last copied into the clipboard prior to that very attempt, which shows that the clipboard's content was not refreshed with the last selected copied one. </p><p>I'm surprised to see that FF has had such a glaring issue for years and for many other users, and updates have never given a fix for it. I'd like this issue to be fixed properly, because I'd hate to have to switch back to my previous browser. FF sports so many nice features that other browsers don't have, and it'd be a shame to ruin the experience with a bug so basic as the copy/paste feature being broken. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;word;office365;probablynotafirefoxproblem;copyandpaste;copyandpaste74;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1299677;1299705;1308168;1308249;,yumiifmb

It gives me the following issue. When I start typing a youtube… URL in the addres bar, a specific subpage to the youtube domain pops up first. It refers to s specific clip on youtube. While I’m typing, in front of it a grey star appears, such a marking a favorite. However, it’s NOT in my favorites.  The autosuggestions do not come from other opened tabs. This option is turned off.  I don’t use any Firefox subscription account services for storing favorites online. Suggestions from search engines are also toggled off.  I’ve tried all remaining suggestions on the following pages to get rid of this issue: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions</a> 1st method for clearing a single item didn’t work; 3rd method to clear my browsing history didn’t work. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978</a> I have turned off browser.urlbar.autoFill = false. Toggling this option, at least, got rid of unsollicited suggestions from the worldwide web such as <a href=""http://youtubemoneycalculator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtubemoneycalculator.com</a>. It’s a partial success! </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978</a> keyword.enabled is set to false, but toggling this won’t make any difference. browser.fixup.alternate.enabled is set to false, but toggling this won’t make any difference. </p><p><br> The only method that makes a difference is to turn off Addres bar suggestions from Favorites (in about:preferences#privacy). But then I don’t get any suggestions at all… </p><p>This example merely illustrates the issue with youtube… domain names, it happens with any address that I start typing in the address bar. Peculiarly, addresses that ARE stored in my favorites, do not appear first in the suggested domain names. Okay, I’ve done my homework! </p><p>My conclusion/question: Some (former) favorites are stored in a location that I have no access to. I would like to receive suggestions as to where I can find these. Preferrably, I do not want to delete every single one of them one by one. </p><p><br> Bottom line: It would be nice if I had some sort of control over my favorites. The suggestions appear to be totally random. If the most recently or most frequently visited favorites would appear first, that would make sense. Or if the main page would appear first (<a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>) and not any other subpages. Does anyone know if this is possible and then, how to achieve this? </p><p>Lastly: I don’t understand why a browser that claims to be so concerned about my privacy allows for so many unwanted options. Also, it is a nuisance if these options are actually reset with every update Firefox installs. I have the impression that this happens. I did notice that now and then additional search engines are added to my one-click-search engines (about:preferences#search) without my prior notification.

When I follow the link to unsubscribe, I'm prompted to log into my account. When I log in, I'm prompted to confirm my account via a verification link sent via email. However, that email to my iCloud account never arrives. I've tried repeatedly to have it resent without success. I've had a case escalated via Apple support up to their engineering department, and they say the email isn't getting filtered by them but in fact never reaches their servers, so there's nothing they can do. So now I'm stuck on this mailing list because I can't access my account. Blocking me from leaving the list seems illegal per the CAN-SPAM act. Even being able to log in here seems short-lived, since it appears that tomorrow (16 March) my Mozilla support account will be merged into that same Firefox account that I can't access. Unbelievable, really. </p><p>The irony isn't lost on me: I can't stop getting email from Firefox because I'm not getting the verification email from Firefox. I see the dark humor, but this is a problem that needs to be resolved. I don't know where else to turn for help, so hoping someone here can provide some guidance. The real ask here is not to just get off the mailing list (I could set up a filter to automatically delete it, though I shouldn't have to do that) but instead to be able to receive the email to verify my account or, barring that, get help changing the email address on the existing account to one that can actually receive the email, e.g. my Gmail account. </p>",other;desktop;escalate;,firefox,other,en-US,1297840;1297841;1297851;1297856;1297889;1297898;1297971;,brossow

This issue has been going on for three weeks. The last Firefox update crashed TWICE! When I opened a Google/Firefox, An Update window popped up. Since I normally let them download or whatever they do, I wasn't concerned. Then it showed an ""Error"". I didn't see an ""Error Code Number or Name"" as it disappeared quickly. I tried to open Firefox/Google. To my surprise, all I got was a Blank Window. I tried clicking on the ""Home Icon"". Nothing changed. I tried my Bookmarks. No affect. I WAS Signed In. I tried finding the Fictional ""Firefox Support"". I got nowhere. I would've Googled the issue, but I couldn't even use that. Nothing Worked. I finely decided to download a NEW Firefox/Google. Once I did, it worked fine all day.  The next day, I opened the newly Downloaded one. Again I was greeted by the Firefox ""Update"" It started, then showed an Error.  Again, I tried to open Firefox/Google. I got the same blank page as before. I decided to Remove, ALL Firefox/Google. from my Computer. Then I download another New Firefox. I made ONE change. I stopped Firefox from Updating Automatically.  Day three, I opened Firefox, I opened  normally... Almost. Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. If I let it Download, it may Crash again. I lost ALL of my Bookmarks too. I went to the Recommended Firefox Site to retrieve them... It was a LIE! Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. I have NEVER missed an Update  Let me guess what Firefox is going to say. That is IF they reply at all; No one else reported this issue. ( And I have Ocean front property in Arizona). Make sure your operating system is up to date.  (I must be too stupid to keep my system up and maintain this Machine). I should upgrade to the (The Digital Pile of...... that goes by the name) Windows 10, and (The Garbage called) Google Chrome. (Why would I Downgrade to one System that didn't work when it was released, a Browser that was Garbage when it was offered the first time (In 2008), and they WON'T Fix? I'd be better off taking a hammer to my PC. and my own head). </p><pre>Just a quick note. When I first signed up for Google (Prior to the 2008 Google Chrome fiasco.) my Gmail stopped working. I could receive Mail, but I couldn't Open, Read, Delete, or anything else. This lasted for Five Years. I tried getting Help. I never got a reply from anyone. Then it started working.

Say you set up a profile(from about:profiles) namely ""BIg Brothers"" for notorious trackers like google, facebook , twitter etc so they can perpetually track each other with simple rules to observe like : - Never open an external(shared) link  - Never access any other website through that profile. </p><p>Is there a particular feature the add-on is bringing up that the native interface is missing ? The other reason is add-ons are great but they tend to bloat the system impeding the browsing experience.

Since I updated to Firefox 74.0 today, I can't resize the windows as I like to do. I can resize them, but it's like there's a minimum fixed size to what I can resize it to and then it locks and doesn't go any slimmer from there (maybe so the browser controls don't overlap?). That fixed size is far too big for my use case, i.e. I absolutely need it slimmer. I'm not entirely sure if the previous Firefox version contained a fixed minimum size, but if it did, it was much smaller (it allowed controls to overlap, which wasn't a problem for me) </p><p>Is there a setting that I can change in Firefox 74 so that I can make the windows as slim as I require again? </p>",customize;desktop;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;needsinfo;pixelwidth;pixelwidth74;,firefox,customize,en-US,1296574;1296600;1296621;1296919;1297233;1297236;1297245;1297440;1307380;1307391;1307404;1307407;1307414;1307482;1307654;1307663;,edys.email

I also think they got access to my laptop as I had passwords in my account that were only these long numbers for website info and if you went there was nothing. I did delete these as there were about 6 of them.  I am very security conscious so this is truly freaking me out.

Here is the situation: I run a listserv where I post many job advertisements for my students. I regularly post many advertisements in ~20 different categories of job type. Currently, I simply find the advertisements, and then copy/paste the header and links into a word document for that category. I then highlight all, copy/paste into an email for that category, and send to students. This creates an organizational nightmare for me...since it means that I have ~20 different windows open. Also...all of the window-switching is a real pain-in-the-rear. </p><p>I think I figured out a partial solution, but I need some help. I can create a ~20 WordPress blogs...one for each job category. WordPress allows a user to post to a blog via email through a unique email link provided for each blog. In this way, my students will not receive emails. Instead, they will go to a blog to see their advertisements. My problem with this option is that it requires me to copy/paste text into a new email, enter in the correct email address, and then send. This many keystrokes for 100+ advertisements a day will take awhile (even if I use all keyboard shortcuts). It would be really nice if I could create ~20 buttons or icons that I can drag and drop highlight text to, and Firefox would run a macro to copy/paste the text into an email with a preset email address for that job category. </p><p>Anything that could help? </p>",tips;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,tips,en-US,1296144;,aaron.stoler

(When broken I see the spinning circle indicating video content is loading or buffering, but it never completes and plays.  Never.  If I don't sync my Firefox to my Account using Firefox Sync, these same videos play every time.) I uninstalled, reinstalled etc. and nothing seemed to work to fix the infinite video loading behavior.  I was using Sync to recall all of my settings so I didn't have to go through all the customization I like.  But pretty soon I realized that I could not keep video content on <a href=""http://foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">foxnews.com</a> working after I would sync Firefox to my Firefox account.   I researched Refreshing Firefox and got video playback one time before refresh stopped working to restore playback.   I finally found out about deleting Profile folders and that finally allowed me to repeatedly get video playback after each Account Sync would break the video playback. This also finally stopped Firefox from importing previous settings and let me build a working set of customization from scratch. I'd like to continue using that Firefox Account, but I want to wipe out and overwrite all Firefox Account Sync settings with new ones. My account already has settings and preferences saved, but these are preferences that break my Firefox install every time. I don't know how to either wipe clean my Firefox Account Sync settings to default.  Or, I don't know how to sync my current working Firefox settings and overwrite all settings in my Firefox Account Sync settings with ones that are not breaking Firefox video playback - on select websites like <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.foxnews.com</a>   I thought it was a Fox News website issue initially until I used a Firefox install on a computer that was not sync'd to my account and that Firefox install played <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.foxnews.com</a> videos every time.   In all I've tried to fix Firefox a min. of 6-10 times myself, but fail every time and need a sharper mind than my own to fix Firefox Account Sync on my Account.   Without help, my current solution is to try creating a new Firefox Account and try Sync again there.  Or I need to assume Firefox Account Sync is unreliable and simply more trouble than it is worth. Fortunately after Deleting my profile folder before reinstalling Firefox, I have been able to use Firefox Refresh to fix video playback after I break video playback on <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.foxnews.com</a> each time I fail in testing a solutions to fix my Firefox Account Sync lately.

When you open a new firefox window, the default url (for example <a href=""https://www.default-url.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.default-url.com</a>) is displayed and then the corresponding web page.  Just after the window is opened, I used to quickly click in the url bar to enter an url (for example <a href=""http://www.new-url.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.new-url.com</a>). Before, when I was clicking in the url bar, the current (default) url was selected (highlighted), and so replaced with what I was typing.  Since a while (I don't really know in which FF version it appeared), when you quickly click in the url bar after opening a new FF window, the current (default) url is selected (highlighted), but if the current page is a bit large (and thus a bit slow to be displayed), then the current url is de-selected, and the cursor is blinking before the url. And so when you type an url, the result url is a concatenation of what you are typing, and the default one (with my example : www.newurl.comhttps://<a href=""http://www.default-url.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.default-url.com</a>). This behaviour can be reproduced with <a href=""https://www.qwant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.qwant.com/</a> as default url for example. </p>",firefox-730;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1295653;1295677;1295686;1296058;,fichatel

However some services bring up their own menus one mouseover that cover this. For example, twitch streams.  Upon mouseover, a twitch stream may bring up its own set of menus and icons and whatnot on the right hand side. Rather than trying to manage moving the pic-in-pic button all over or what-have-you, simply being able to enable it through the context menu seems like a nice idea. If the service covers the button, you can simply right click the video and activate it from the context menu instead. </p><p>Attached is a screenshot of the problem (that took me about 10 minutes of very careful mouse positioning to get) You can see the pic-in-pic button behind all the overlays (that only appear on mouseover), so being able to right click the video instead and activate from there avoids this. </p><p>P.S. For anybody who runs into this, if you're *very* patient and careful, you can get the pic-in-pic button to be clickable if you move your mouse in from the right-hand side, I think twitch has a 3 or 4 pixel threshold while the pic-in-pic button doesn't, so you can actually get it, but it's a bit silly. </p>",firefox-730;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1295569;1295778;,jqpstg

The colors used in browser toolbox (Ctrl + Shft + Alt + I) *Style Editor* uses Code Mirror selectors. Due to less than perfect sight &amp; the poor visibility / contrast colors of found search terms &amp; several other things in Style Editor, I needed to change things. </p><p>I didn't have too much problem finding most of CM's CSS selectors for what I needed. In all the CSS files associated with code mirror in the dark theme, I haven't found how to change the foreground (text) color when selecting lines or sections of code. </p><p>In Linux, Style Editor's default selected background is almost the same as the body BG color (looking at the hex colors used, and just visually. This from codemirror.css in omni.ja, changes selected, unfocused background: .CodeMirror-selected {  </p><pre> background: #D4E7F9 !important; </pre> <p>This changes the selected, focused BG color: .CodeMirror-line::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span::selection, .CodeMirror-line &gt; span &gt; span::selection {  </p><pre>  background-color: #E9ECD8 !important; } </pre> <p>But I've found nothing for foreground ""color,"" to make the selected text legible through the light selected BG color I chose.  Just adding ""color: #0000FF !important;"" - under the background property doesn't work (like many CSS styled UIs - especially text editors). </p><p>Is it possible that Code Mirror doesn't have a way to change the text color on selected areas?  Most text editors I've tested usually have preference menu settings for things like selected - foreground &amp; BG color.  Or they have themes that add extra UI styling ability. The themes on code mirror's site don't seem to use selected foreground color (or just ""color"").  Maybe it doesn't understand that concept. </p><p>If the highlight BG color chosen for CM is fairly light with some transparency, you can read some darker syntax colors, but not all. </p><p>Using another text editor with better search, I looked &amp; searched all files I could find that control some of Style Editor's / code mirror's colors. </p><p>The only thing I found where I could change selected text color was one rule for searching in Style Editor.  It's in codemirror.css ... and it doesn't work that consistently for visibility.  /chrome/devtools/content/shared/sourceeditor/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css </p><pre>The default colors (someone) used for search term matches have little contrast. </pre> <p>LINE 330: .cm-searching { </p><pre> background-color: rgba(255, 255, 170, 0.6) !important; /* The 1st BG value listed is for focused search result highlight.*/  color: #0808E5 !important;  background-color: rgba(2226, 253, 251, .6) !important; } </pre> <p>NOTE: I added the color property in "".cm-searching"" -  and it worked.

Next, I found the places.sqlite file will update automatically without shutting down Firefox (most likely when the computer is put to sleep and then awakened). A warning about this little known file updating would be helpful to those who learned about their lost history, but choose to wait until later, like recovering it prior to shutting down, but they will have lost the opportunity when the places.sqlite file self updates itself automatically (who knows exactly when or why)  I'd like to see this important information placed your answer on this same (above) troubleshooting page, because when I loose history caused by a proper shut down, I'll need to your page infor to remind me what to be cautious about. And I don't believe you have created a back up file to places.sqlite to which I can recover and rename yet, because I believe the closest name to it has very little memory in it, but I could be wrong. </p>",firefox-690;other;desktop;windows-7;feature-request;escalate;,firefox,other,en-US,1294638;1295045;1295047;,cvmenn

The problem from before remained solved as well, so don't worry about that. The only problem is that now, for whatever reason, I can't delete any bookmarks. I can still add and edit bookmarks, but I can't outright delete them. My version is 73.0.1 (64-bit). </p><p><br> I've gone to about:support and checked Places Database. This is what it gave me: </p><p>&gt; Task: checkIntegrity - Unable to check favicons.sqlite integrity: Error: Error(s) encountered during statement execution: database disk image is malformed &gt; Task: invalidateCaches - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: checkCoherence - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: expire - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: originFrecencyStats - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: vacuum - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: stats - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. &gt; Task: _refreshUI - The task queue was cleared by an error in another task. </p><p><br> A solution that I've seen elsewhere is to delete the ""places.sqlite"" file after closing Firefox and letting it reset, but that hasn't worked. Again, I can add and edit bookmarks, just not delete them. It doesn't matter where I try to delete them from (within the browser), and they all still link to the right places. It's not an emergency, but I'd appreciate help with this. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-730;firefox-7301;desktop;windows-10;cannotdeletebookmarks;escalate;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1294462;1294467;1294471;1294562;1294563;1300672;,shabcarb
