By strength of will &amp; great physical effort I was able to turn the clock back in my mind to an earlier era in my life? About 20 or 30 years? Although I was 65+ when I left hospital, visits to a friend in The Philippines, &amp; great deal of help patience &amp; effort from her enabled me to get my mind &amp; body back to the level of fitness that I thought I had immediately before the accident? Which I perceived or imagined was approximately age 45 to 50? Anyway, more on this subject for anybody who has sufficient interest to write &amp; enquire? All that I need to know now is how to create a bookmark or file containing only ""NEUROPLASTCITY"" items or website links? </p>",bookmarks;firefox-720;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1285661;,roydavid

What's responsible for the update process and what folders need to have which permissions for this to work? </p><p>Because right now, pressing the ""Update to 73.0 Beta 11"" button results in Firefox downloading the update but when it tries to install it, it fails with the ""Update failed.

I've tried tons of things that people suggest for this issue,like disabling every service that isn't absolutely necessary etc,disabling some of them fixes it for a short while,then the same thing starts again. Tried a couple of different anti-virus programs [I usually use Avast,I tried Panda and Bitdefender],it did seem a tiny bit better for a while with Panda...but only for a while. I tried several other things I saw in different forums,that I can't remember,none of which fixed it.

Close the program"". I do not click the link to close the program I click the ""X"" at the top right of the popup window. That will initiate a reload of the page. But, the page loads with none of the graphics loading. If I click the refresh button myself my page will load just fine. The only reason I even did an upgrade was because it would not let me load ANY page and kept saying my flash player was out of date and had to be updated.  I did update flash but Firefox would still not work. A couple months ago I tried to do an upgrade which crashed. I ended up doing an uninstall and installed the latest version. I lost everything including my profile. After much searching for answers using Google Chrome I finally found out how to retrieve a copy of my old profile and help on how to install it. I did an upgrade this week which I had to do from Google Chrome but at least it worked and I didn't have to lose anything. But, then it would not use flash so I had to again use Google Chrome to get flash to download and install the correct update. You know... all that NPAPI and NPAPI crap because Firefox uses a different version of flash player than Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. I  am currently using version 72.0.2 of Firefox. I had installed an update for Flash player before updating Firefox. I had to reinstall the version of Flash that I had just installed. I am now running version 32.0.0.321. Firefox still stops working and I still have to jump through the hoops of reloading it. I am NOT going to update my Windows 7 Home because I do not want Windows 10. If I try to update my graphics card MS will force me to upgrade Windows. They stopped supporting Windows 7. The only good thing is that now it does not open the library item on boot that even after following instructions to turn off kept loading anyway. All that installing and reinstalling eats up a lot of my metered data allowance so the next time I will probably just uninstall Firefox. I forgot to say that NO I DO NOT OWN A SMART PHONE AND DO NOT PLAN ON GETTING ONE. MY DESKTOP PC WORKS JUST FINE. I DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD AN APP EVERY TIME I WANT TO DO ANYTHING. If using computers for the past 40 years has taught me anything it is all about putting money in someone's pocket and making it easier for thieves to destroy my life. I am sorry that the youth of today are stupid and want things to be easy and do not realize the expense to their very existence.  I do not want you to fix anything. I apologize for my attitude.

I must reenter password on every site I go to and reenter any non-default setting.  Is there a setting I am missing that can prevent this?  I will be in this India location for several months, so I prefer this not to keep happening.  BTW, I am unsophisticated and need to know how to reach or alter any files involved. </p>",fix-problems;firefox-720;desktop;firefox-7201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1284357;1284361;1284365;,abushenob

Even with only 1 process.,"<p>After 72.0.2 I started to notice performance problems with my firefox. Symptoms are similiar to my multiprocess problems I had after it was added. I managed to avoid it for some time by limiting processes number to 1 (which was 4 in reality) </p><p>Long story short: when you open new tab firefox has to create new process which is somewhat correlated to your PC performance (however it hangs up even on 4800MHz i5 with nvme pci-e 3.0 x4 ssd so....). When this process is already created and you enter different website it is smooth - firefox does not have to create another process until you open NEW TAB or it reaches its limit (from 1 to 8 processes/tabs) - set via settings.  If limit was set to more than 1 I had problems with hanging up for few seconds until I reached limit - so if it was set to 4 I opened 1 tab and 3 links I clicked (with new tabs) slowed firefox down for me, but 4th, 5th etc. were fine. So I set it to 1 permanently and problem disappeared - every tab opened as fast as before. </p><p>But now problem seems to have returned. I still have 1 in my settings but symptoms are pretty much the same (but there are only 4 processes). However browser is not hanging up - it seems like connection is. It does nothing - ""waiting for xxxxxx"" in lower left corner and then after 1-2s page actually starts to load. It is present on every website I visit, no matter how many tabs or windows I open. </p><p>So my question is - what did you break in this firefox version?

Now, after the update, when I attempt to go into my Quickbooks Online account and create a 'new' estimate or invoice, the menus work, but after clicking, nothing opens.

I've noticed the same thing on other websites, gemlux marine boat parts is another. Same thing, clicking in a menu does not open the link. </p><p>Lastly, when shopping on Amazon, if an item has an option (like sizes, colors, etc), and I click on the different size or color, it does not update the item page and price like it normally does. In other words, if I have a $20 item in size SMALL, and hit the drop down to change it to a size LARGE which should be $10 more, the price change does not show in Amazon's price menu. I found that if I click the 'large' in the drop down, leave it, and refresh the page, the page loads with the 'large' size selected, and then prices it correctly.  </p><p>For whatever reason, if I switch to 'privacy' mode, it works fine. </p><p>I have used all of these websites frequently in the past year, and only in the last week has this started occurring.

It's always a text box, and only those which allow you to change the font characteristics and style.  Without the ability to change font, it uses the fonts from my settings.

But since I migrated to win10, I've been experiencing a trouble. </p><p>Back in my win7 environment, things were working as intended.  I went to ""about:preferences#privacy"".

I opened a page of a location on the weather forecast site, and went to the top page, it of-course remembered the location. But I opened the top page on ANOTHER TAB, it forgets the location.

I use Whatsapp.web to chat when on my PC. I have no trouble connecting to Whatsapp.web using my Iphone and Firefox. However, EVERY time that FF closes, for a restart, or simply when I make a mistake and accidentally close the browser, the connection to Whatsapp.web is apparently broken. I say apparently because on the Iphone, it sontinues to list Windows 10 as an active device using the web app. When I used Microsoft Edge, once I scanned the QR code and connected, I would STAY connected, even overnight after I had shut down the PC. I am wondering if there are certain privacy or security settings which are preventing Whatsapp from staying connected when the FF browser closes. I also remember that a couple of years ago, when I was using FF in the 40s versions, maybe, Whatsapp also stayed connected. Just a note: the reason this is sort of a problem for me is that I am blind, and I use certain visual accessibility settings on Windows and FF that do not allow the Whatsapp QR to be scanned; so I have to change the entirevisual setting of my PC, scan the code, then restore the entire visual setting.

I started looking for support and chose to uninstal v72 - shut down my laptop and restarted it. I downloaded the latest version and at the end of install - where 'run firefox' is expected - nothing happened. I have since uninstalled and downloaded the latest beta version (73) - and now, when I ask to run the program, it opens a window but all the tabs are 'dead' and no matter what I type, the program does not connect to the internet (i.e. Google search or direct to a known web address). If I select settings, I can see the drop-down list - but if I select 'Add-ons' (for example) - nothing happens. I attempted to run my laptop in safe mode, but I have no recall of the password needed to get past the login screen.

It automatically included ublock origin 1.24.2 There are many sites where you actually want pop ups (bank statements, downloads, etc.)  On my other computers with Firefox, ublock shows a bar at the top of the browser and gives me the option to say- No pop up, allow once only, or always allow for this site. I didn't have to change any settings to have this happen. However, on this newly downloaded version it doesn't do that and it's very frustrating and cumbersome to use. Basically, I have to know that the site wants to pop up a new screen, turn off ublock, and then remember to turn it back on. I have looked all through the ublock and firefox settings to figure out how to do this and can't see where to make this bar show. Very frustrating! Any tips for fixing this?

1277697,2020-01-18 18:17:50 -0800,2020-01-18T21:44:29Z,Video playback issues,"<p>I am currently having issues with Youtube, Netflix, and <a href=""http://vrv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">vrv.co</a>, all video streaming sites over on Firefox, though only in full screen mode, and only on those particular video streaming sites, and I don't know why. As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser. Strangely, safe mode removes the issue, but again, not sure why. I did check another browser— Namely Waterfox Classic. That worked fine. And so far the only suggestion anyone has had from the tech service that I have on the machine has made that makes sense is that this might be a video driver issue. I did just recently update my drivers, this is true. However the issue did not start up until a few days after this had occurred. I tried reinstalling the driver to see if that would fix the issue.  The issue itself is very weird. It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop.  </p><p>Again, Waterfox does not seem to have this issue. At first it was suggested to me on another thread that the issue might be because Waterfox Classic doesn't use hardware acceleration, so I turned that off on Firefox. Which does allow things to play more or less okay, though at times when I scroll, it seems to mess with the screen in a similar fashion to the initial playback issues, and again, it's not consistent with that, just like it's not consistent with the video playback when the browser's Hardware acceleration is on. </p><p>However, I just learned that Waterfox Classic /does/ use hardware acceleration, though it seems to have a much lower content limit set by default. This makes me think that whatever is going on may be a glitch in Firefox itself that may have somehow come up. Though how and why I have no earthly clue, as prior to last Monday there was no issue, as I said earlier. More unusually sometimes the effect vanishes on videos where it's shown up.  </p><p>I have tried to screenhot this and it /never/ appears in screenshots, and doesn't show up when paused either. I've even tried to take a picture of it with my phone or record it with said. Also no luck. I /have/ however, been able to find a video that does this affect deliberately, so I can at least present it here. Again, this is not consistent, seems to move around the screen, and only seems to occur on those three video sites as I stated. Apparently whatever the issue is, it's /NOT/ something to do with the hardware acceleration, as I learned, again, that WaterfoxClassic /does/ use it and it is active in that browser, and was active when I first tried it, so that narrows it down to some kind of glitch either with Firefox or Windows and how it interacts with either the former or the latter, depending on where the glitch is coming from.  </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's causing this? </p><p>The image attached is an example of what I'm seeing, however, bear in mind that this video is /deliberately/ showing this effect in an attempt to replicate the type of thing one might see on old video tapes being played after years of disuse, but it /is/ the same general appearance, more or less, of what I occasionally see on Firefox when using the videos on the above mentioned sites. </p>",other;firefox-720;desktop;firefox-7201;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1282463;1282466;1282470;1282478;1282482;1282485;,Marc7

However, it is not really ""as normal"" because I have to SIGN INTO the websites again. Sometimes it remembers the username and password and all I have to do is click through it, but sometimes it doesn't and I have to manually sign into them. Bookmarks aren't ever saved either.

Firefox has been acting strange lately. Opened up the package contents of the app (on macbook pro 2012) and saw a chrome manifest folder that seemed to be blocking web access on certain sites. Using a similar computer (with ff installed) and decided to look in the app folder. I saw a blocklist.xml sheet. Wondering if this is something that should be in there by default? Some of the things on the list, are things that i'd more likely need than not need. Here is a list of blocked sites and ip addresses. Any help is greatly appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks,  </p><p> &lt;blocklist xmlns=""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/2006/addons-blocklist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/2006/addons-blocklist</a>"" lastupdate=""1578526685310""&gt;

Open duckduckgo, search something, and click on any https link that has not been whitelisted in the proxy. 3. After the click, nothing happens -&gt; no error, no information message, nothing. (in the dev tools -&gt; network tab, one can see a 403 status.) </p><p>This also happens when browsing websites: if the website includes a link to another website that is not whitelisted, nothing happens, the user is not informed that the host could not be reached. </p><p>This seems like a mechanism has been broken, as FF always used to inform the user of the host not responding with an error page. </p><p>Thanks for reading, sb3k </p>",firefox-720;desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1280116;1280269;,mozilla.org8

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall. </p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen. </p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout. </p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly. </p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second. </p><p>Reproduce: - client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a> - client.html: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ</a> </p><p>1) Put client.js and client.html into a directory and open client.html in Firefox 72. 2) (optional) Do the same but with Chromium. </p>",other;firefox-720;desktop;linux;,firefox,other,en-US,"",anole3623

Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash.  If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in.  Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart.  Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem. </p><p>I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time.  This happened three times in the last six months.  As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on. </p><p>Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop: </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:19:56 achpee kernel: [3642722.464002] Web Content[17741]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f6881995024 sp 00007ffd2548d010 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f687d5ad000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:20:40 achpee kernel: [3642765.713880] Web Content[18209]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f2f71605024 sp 00007fff08ecc490 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f2f6d21d000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:20:53 achpee kernel: [3642778.682450] Web Content[18253]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f46d16fd024 sp 00007ffdf062b6e0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f46cd315000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 21:18:29 achpee kernel: [3653435.096133] Web Content[27212]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f081696d024 sp 00007ffd774ee3e0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f0812585000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 21:19:52 achpee kernel: [3653518.422883] Web Content[28191]: segfault at 3 ip 00007faa3c23d024 sp  00007ffe1e89e1c0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7faa37e55000+4665000] </p><p>No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation.  On a Linux box?  Seriously?  Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting). </p><p>By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime.  Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached. </p><p>I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms.  Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray?  No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday.  That seems unlikely since the crash has happened very frequently since yesterday on a variety of websites: </p><p>$ sudo zgrep libxul /var/log/kern.log | wc -l </p><p>32 </p><p>There is a prior bug report describing a similar experience here: <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100</a> For what it's worth, a coworker on another team at my company also ran into these symptoms and mitigated it on his corporate laptop simply by reinstalling. </p><p>Is there a way to mine the automated crash reporter data to see if this is an emerging trend of some kind? </p>",firefox-710;desktop;fix-problems;linux;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1278926;,nemesis2

As we all do. </p><p>I'm sorry this is probably going to be a long explanation but want all to have the full picture. </p><p>Over the years I would always back up my bookmarks as an html file whenever I reinstalled windows, got a new pc etc. One thing it seems I have missed and may be an issue is over the years I never made a firefox account. Just used the browser. </p><p>Recently like many I'm sure, I updated a windows 7 laptop to windows 10.  </p><p>This one time, I forgot to back up the bookmarks as an html file, just the rest of my files on the pc. This might of been because of all the chaos at the holidays or because I had already learned that the new windows 10 install can save everything from windows 7. </p><p>I installed the windows 10 and selected the option to save all files and programs. When the install finished, there it was, what seemed to be my exact windows 7 laptop, files, and programs just with the windows 10 system now. FANTASTIC! All good! </p><p>Not good. A few days later the laptop would not boot up. It was frozen at the windows 10 logo part of the start up with the spinning and spinning but never opened. </p><p>Searched online for answers, found some, and tried all fixes. The laptop would also not start the auto repair feature. </p><p>At this point I had to take it somewhere. I have an online business and of course it was all in that laptop... and backed up from a few weeks earlier. </p><p>The place I would have taken it was closed for the week. took somewhere else. </p><p>I told them I needed two things only since the pc was backed up a couple weeks back.  </p><p>The files on the desktop and my FIREFOX BOOKMARKS! Easy right? </p><p>They tried I'm sure the same methods I tried to get it to boot. They could not and said they would have to reinstall windows. </p><p>Fine, no problem, they were told clearly what to save and windows 10 can save it anyway during the install. </p><p>These idiots did not use the save all the files and programs option. They backed up files to their computers and wiped the laptop clean! Now what? </p><p>Well we know the installation makes a windows old file and we all know firefox saves bookmark back ups, saves around 15 or so but you'll always have the most recent. </p><p>This is the problem. Firefox didn't seem to saving the bookmarks or updating the backups. </p><p>In my brand new laptop I can see in the backup bookmarks folder that it is backing up everyday or so and in just under a week I already have several days of backup bookmarks in the folder. </p><p>On the old laptop, with the reinstall, the bookmark back up folder in the windows old folder has a list of backup json files but the last json file has a date created of September 2019 and then in the file name it seems to show a date of 12-22-19 which I thought was the bookmarks I needed seeing the December date in the file name. But it's not and they are what seems to be back from September. So why no back up json file for the last three months. I know that seems to be a short amount of time but first, the bookmarks seem to be older than september based on things I was doing at the time and in the last three months I have made major changes in my business and started a new one. EVERYTHING IS MISSING&gt;  </p><p>Hope I can find some help. I read an article about everything possibly being in sqlite file or something. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>Jon </p>",bookmarks;firefox-710;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1278859;1278861;1278995;1279003;1279022;,jdw6942

The browser is telling us that our information could be compromised, while the documentation states that attackers should not be able to access personal data. </p><p>Can you please clarify which one is correct? Also, if the browser is misleading, it should be corrected in a future update. If the problem is with the documentation, it should be updated. </p><p>BTW, I noticed that the website had Google Analytics objects embedded.

This _time indexing_ and _chronological display_ of visited pages is an _invaluable_ asset in LEARNING (item linked to those visited before and after, work session span, etc.). I use the tags for notes / page extracts (the limited tag length is great because it forces to be concise). I continuously curate this history and delete LOADS of things that I decide are no longer valuable, but I still have several years worth of notes. So I search and find a page, and its date is more that 6 months in the past. Now (as explained above) I have to navigate to that time to see THE CONTEXT of THAT _learning experience_.

I'm a developer and burgeoning font nerd, and I'm really into shell configuration for Zsh, which requires some custom fontography. </p><p>These overlapping areas use various fonts that provide glyphs for characters inside the Unicode Private Use Areas. Examples are: </p> <ul><li> All the things aggregated into NerdFonts - <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts</a> </li><li> The Powerline shell-prompt symbols - <a href=""https://github.com/powerline/powerline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/powerline/powerline</a> </li><li> Klingon - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html</a> </li><li> Anything else in the ConScript Registry - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/</a> </li></ul> <p>So, I'd like to set up my browser to be able to display a few, or all of these things. For example, in the discussion going on at the GitHub issue <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409</a>. </p><p>But I don't see any way in Firefox to set up a chain of ""fallback fonts"" or something like that. In Preferences &gt; Language and Appearance &gt; Fonts and Colors &gt; Advanced, it gives me a selection for ""Fonts for:"", which allows me to assign fonts on a per-script basis. But: </p><p>a) assigning a single font for ""Other Writing Systems"" (assuming that encompasses the Unicode PUA areas) is not sufficient, and b) uh-oh, maybe bug! When I select ""Other Writing Systems"" and choose a new font for it (like the Klingon font ""plqaD""), it changes the main ""Default font"" for me back in the main preferences screen! That doesn't seem right? </p><p>Thing is, there are a lot of these ""long tail"" little special-purpose fonts, that it would be nice to aggregate into a single viewing context. It would be nice if Firefox supported defining an arbitrarily-long list of ""fallback"" fonts to use in the case where a web page uses a character which is not assigned a glyph in any of the normal fonts. </p>",firefox-710;customize;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,customize,en-US,1278025;1278027;,apjanke
