Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall. I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen.

The solution is Ctrl+F5 and voila the website loads without issue. However, this is definitely an ""issue"" and the issue isn't with the website or the lack of knowledge of the end user. End users should not need to know how to refresh their local cache of a website to resolve a security certificate expiring when it has already been renewed.

This is NOT because Fill Color is set, and it's not tolerable, because I use Fill Color to represent the status of a cell. Once a cell ""goes green,"" nothing I have tried will fix it. Today I decided that I had to fix a particular row containing green cells even if I had to re-enter it. I created a new row above the problem row and copied the original row's cells to the new row one by one, pasting each one into the text box at the top of the sheet, rather than the cell itself. That should have inserted the text only. But as I entered the text into each new cell in turn, the cell turned green. I need to find a solution to this problem, or I'll have to change browsers.

Deleting and reinstalling would work, but I'd have to re-set all my settings, re-activate the theme, etc., and all the browsing history would be lost. So, since then I would rarely shut it down.  A few days ago I had to shut the Mac down completely, but this time Firefox Dev wouldn't open after re-installing. Oddly, I tried regular Firefox again as a solution, and it opened this time. I tested it out by shutting the Mac down completely, then restarting, and it retained all of the settings! I was really glad to once again be able to shut down ...",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;macos-1015;bsod;download-and-install;firefoxdeveloperquestion;firefox-730;firefox-710;,firefox,en-US

While a great tool, I believe the companies can benefit as well. Most users have laptops. Laptops leave the confines of the office regularly. Why not have laptops configured so that they point to a companies DNS infrastructure when not in the office? The benefit would be that any filtering/monitoring being done via DNS no longer is limited to when devices are on the company network! This would require companies exposing DNS to the internet which is considered a bad idea. DNS will expose internal secrets and let the bad guys probe the architecture of the network for information they can use later. Adding authentication to the DoH solution would allow companies to leverage their internal certificate infrastructure and already deployed client certificates to protect that DNS information.

There's a screenshot of what the addons page looks like in 99.99% of the time. I tried everything I could think of, including deleting history, browser cache, resetting to a clean profile, etc. - nothing changed it back to the normal view. I even tried as described at the end of this article https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-look-wrong-or-appear-differently to click ""View"" menu but it already is set to ""Basic view"", so that didn't help either. Installing an addon works fine, it's just that the website appears as a broken CSS. The browser version is Firefox 73.0.1 64-bit.

After some digging, I found that its possible for a corrupt `cookies.sqlite` if the max file size has been reached and a suggestion that FF automatically resets this `cookies.sqlite` store when this happens.  I suspect that this issue happened when the user maxed out their cookies, causing a corrupt `cookies.sqlite` file. Then, when they restarted FF, their store had been cleared and they had no problems. However, I cannot find any documentation about FF behavior when in handling corrupt cookies or resetting the `cookies.sqlite` file. I'm looking for some concrete answers.

For readability reasons on my 3840x2160 4K monitor I changed the system font to a font that is a little larger than Segoe UI.  No matter what font I choose I get boxes instead of the characters that should be displayed.  The characters in question are the < and > characters.

I haven't come across any problems like this in any other Windows programs I use and so far in Firefox only on my bug report.  It appears that Segoe UI has all the characters in it while other fonts do not.  Unicode issue perhaps?  Any ideas on how to fix this other than going back to Segoe UI?

The only solution I have found to restore full functionality is to complete uninstall Firefox, including all profiles and preference files, reboot, reinstall a fresh download, and resync via Firefox Sync. I'd love to get some help troubleshooting what could be causing the corruption in the first place. This issue doesn't affect any other browser I use (Brave, Edge Chromium, Safari).

With the advent of Covid-Home-Schooling-Online I need to secure the Windows laptop for an 8 yr old. I already use Firefox and am researching best methods of making safe for kids. Options so far are installing Parental Control Addins that I am warned is 'NOT A RECOMMENDED EXTENSION' and for which the website offers little in information about their provenance. Is there really not a Mozilla Firefox web blocker? I've considered switching Windows to Parental Controls mode but this requires using a MS family account - which leads to my subject question: does MS not then track and utilise an awful lot of usage and info about my child then? I find it hard to understand why a Firefox feature requires an MS account - as Prefer:Safe cannot be switched on without it - so I assume Mozilla has verified and passed the MS account system as non intrusive...? ,firefox-740;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,en-US

To get this research back, I am using Sync - but none of the original windows was preserved.  Instead there is just a long list of all of the tabs I had open across all the windows I had open.  Why does Sync not preserve the separate windows?  With well over a hundred tabs open, this makes recovering/accessing this information very tedious - as all the tabs have to be opened individually, and then sorted into separate windows again, to be bookmarked in their search subject categories/windows!  Was this just an oversight, or is it technically not possible to preserve separate windows in Sync?   If it is technically not possible to preserver multiple windows of tabs in Sync, it would be much more workable if it were possible to mark these tabs in Sync to re-open them, rather than have to open them individually or all of the tabs at once from that other machine.

Then I turned on my raspberry Pi. And all my hard-work of deleting history got synced with my laptop. Ok I deleted them again. Then I turned on my Computer... Oh No! Again it got synced...

I am not a god, but a mere human. God may have the patience to change Firefox theme of his laptop, sync his other computer, and change both of his computer's theme to the ""default"" one. He might then change both of his computer's and laptop's themes, and turn on his raspberry pi, and all the three computers now has the ""default"" theme. These things were like this for ages. I think I am wrong thinking sync shouldn't work this way. Say in google, when you type something, it's saved to your search history, you remove it from one device, then it's gone from all the devices. But maybe Firefox devs think sync is merely syncing all the devices together. There should be a timestamp in sync. When you change one theme in the future, you should change it for all the devices. You shouldn't change your laptop's theme to the desktop ones again because simply it should override the theme on the Firefox server.

I don't intend to run this on a webserver (though it would of course be possible to do so). Now initially everything would simply fit in the html, but later I moved the javascript portion into separate files. This all worked well, until I wanted to switch to using ecmascript 6 modules. Simply adding the type=""module"" attribute breaks everything since my sourced script tags trigger the error described in https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp. Now I understand the reasoning behind that change, but I do believe the behaviour in this context is very strange and definitely inconsistent.

Essentially with Firefox 75.0 on Windows 10 64 bit,  Firefox seems to have a completely dysfunctional spell checker.  This is despite the spell check option for “check my spelling” being enabled in settings and a dictionary being installed. The advanced options also on “spellcheckDefault pref” has selected Boolean as opposed to Number or String, for whatever difference this would make. Additionally in other browsers on the same system, screenshot provided Chromium Edge Beta, spellchecker does work as expected. Is this a Windows 10 wide issue, since on my work P.C [also Windows 10 64 bit] – this version running Firefox E.S.R - I experience the same issues with spell check despite, like on my home machine, having spell check enabled in settings and a dictionary installed. Many thanks for any assistance which may be given. EDIT: 28/04/2020, 17:30 GMT: Title changed to reflect what actually was inst...",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,en-US

After doing that the browser time is only ahead by one hour compared to my local actual time but it's still off. Everything on my local settings is correct. When I check the time on the web console it returns the wrong time, the time is ahead by one hour. The timezone is wrong too, it returns Atlantic Daylight Time when it should be AST or ET. My guess is this has something to do with daylight savings time(maybe?) We don't do that where we live so this would be all useless for me. Did not worked: Restarting with add ons disabled.

This leads me to think there must be some aspects that can be handled by an extension, and some that can not due to internal coding. I can't understand why the FireFox development team wouldn't work with the community to provide those Tab Mix Plus enhancements to the internal coding that no longer can be created by an extension. It would seem like the competitive thing to do, so i must believe that there either is a real security reason, or simply the old extension was not as popular as i think it was.

Instead it takes 3 times to switch to another window - first press of the Alt-tab combination causes Firefox to lose focus but remain on top, 2nd press returns focus onto Firefox and then the 3rd one actually switches to another window. This also occurs when simply switching to fullscreen on any other website as well (by pressing F11). This also causes any newly open windows to be displayed under the Firefox window. Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Esc minimizes the window normally and the issue does not occur then, however, it occurs again whenever I go fullscreen. The problem occurs also in the Safe mode.

I have not installed any new software, no registry hacks, have changed nothing in the browsers config, so I suppose it has something to do with the update to 76.0.1 Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
