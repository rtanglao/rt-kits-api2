And multiple profiles in different firefox version (stable and beta)?,"<p>Dear Mozilla team, I'd like to set up 2 different profiles: one for email, banking and other sensitive stuff and the other for general web surfing. Honestly, so far I've used Firefox for the first job and Chrome for the second one. Now I would like to try to set-up 2 profiles in Firefox to use it for both purposes While I used to use 2 different browsers before, now I would use the same browser, which can access both profiles. I'm afraid that if I browse with my hobby profile, a possible threat could easily access or compromise the data of the second profile.  Is the solution of using 2 different browsers actually more secure? What if I use the stable version together with the beta version of Firefox instead? I would like clarification on this.

But after fresh setup of firefox in PC-B, the city list in this add-on will be reverted to default list. And other add-on has the same behavior.  Why do the theme in PC-A revert back to default? If I applied a theme on firefox of PC-A first. Then I sign in in the fresh installed firefox on PC-B, The theme of PC-A will be synced to the default theme, like the PC-B one.  I know the sync should be bi-direction. But the setting of PC-A is already exited in server. And setting of PC-B is all default like blank paper.

So in FF72 and all previous versions double tapping on YouTube videos switched between fullscreen and windowed modes of said videos, yet with FF73 for some reason double tapping now does fast forward/fast backwards 10 seconds actions depending on where I tap on the screen, which is something I understand is an expected behaviour on Android and other mobile oriented operating systems. I hate it and want double tap to go to it's old functionality. Going back to FF72 does fix the problem, so the problem is not on YouTube's end. Also going back to the previous version of FF creates a whole set of annoying problems, so it's obviously not optimal.

Had to go to Safari,"<p>Went to <a href=""http://www.musicnotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.musicnotes.com</a> to buy some sheet music.  I had a 1 page sample.  I then paid <a href=""http://musicnotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">musicnotes.com</a> and was asked to print the music and I could not print.  I finally called up <a href=""http://musicnotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">musicnotes.com</a> and got help.  I was told that using a Mac, a Firefox browser was a problem.  I was then directed to Safari and was successful in printing.  I use Firefox because my use of Safari is limited.  It is not my #1 browser.  Does Firefox need to be fixed?   </p><p><em>[Personal information removed by moderator.

1280711,2020-02-25 15:13:48 -0800,2020-02-29T13:19:07Z,how to link a page to open it in firefox,"<p>I designed a page in Wordpress but a part of it looks wrong in Chrome, so I want to make sure that people open/view it in Firefox, where it is properly displayed. Is there a way to force users to open that link in Firefox rather than in their current browser? On my homepage and in the menu, I would like to link that page so that it opens in Firefox. What do I need to add to &lt;a href&gt; tag for it to happen? I want just that one link to be opened in Firefox, so it is no help to suggest a solution which forces users to open all links in Firefox, like adding a code in &lt;head&gt; tag. Thank you in advance. best regards, natalija </p>",firefox-730;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1293340;1293358;1294314;1294338;1294342;1294343;1294346;1294348;1294349;1294350;1294353;1294354;1294355;1294357;1294358;1294359;1294360;1294361;1294363;1294364;1294365;1294366;1294369;1294370;,natalija7

First 3 links I was bounced through are below. I know it is not legitimate. The grammar is weird and word choice is odd. The Microsoft Support phone number on the page is also incorrect.  Any concerns I should have? I have run a full scan with Windows defender without any issues showing up. Have not noticed any unusual processes running. </p><p><a

Using (CCleaner),"<p>Initially this may seem the simplest problem but Im not sure it is.  Perhaps due to order of closing session windows. I have this problem once every few years, So far I havent managed to set up anythng that works reliably to get me out of the mess. I use FF and have over 1000 tabs. 99% of the time 'restore session from before' after reboot works automatically great.  Obviously with that many tabs things slow down, I then use CCLEANER to clear up and reboot.Today I forgot I had mutliple unimportant firefox windows open in addition to my MOTHERLOAD firefox window. I closed my session in perhaps some haphazzard order. On restarting I only had my unimportant windows open.  I have not restarted after this Im still sitting in the new session. I have yet to find a consistent way to backup my open tabs. In the past I had an addon which wrote my tabs to a file but that addon got dumped after an update to FF. I REALLY REALLY dont want to lose my list of tabs as I wont be able to get this info back But more that this what is the safest way to back this info up on a regular basis in a way that I can get back to it? The current way is not 100% foolproof. :( </p><p>I have no history showing in FF as CCleaner removes all that (session data isnt removed). I assume I might have restore or previous restore files? Really not sure where to look. Im on Windows 10. Im not even sure where to look anymore for the sessonrestore file. Perhaps it doesnt save it when it isnt the last window to be closed??? Im reluctant to close this session now too. (Hope all my terminology is correct. Is it a window has mutiple tabs, you can have more than one window all of which comprise the session.) </p><p>Any help appreciated.

When clicking the icon it bounces once and then disappears from the dock. Honestly, this started happening about August 2018, and in my troubleshooting decided to give the Developer edition a try, and for some reason that one worked so I stuck with it. </p><p>Shortly thereafter (a week or two) whenever I closed down the Mac, Firefox Dev wouldn't re-open. Deleting and reinstalling would work, but I'd have to re-set all my settings, re-activate the theme, etc., and all the browsing history would be lost. So, since then I would rarely shut it down.  </p><p>A few days ago I had to shut the Mac down completely, but this time Firefox Dev wouldn't open after re-installing. Oddly, I tried regular Firefox again as a solution, and it opened this time. I tested it out by shutting the Mac down completely, then restarting, and it retained all of the settings! I was really glad to once again be able to shut down my laptop at the end of the day without the headache of having to reinstall and re-set everything. </p><p>Then this morning, boom - back to the same nonsense, except now it won't open at all. Neither the regular FF or the Developer edition will work. I've done clean uninstalls to see if that was the problem, as in: removed them from the Applications folder, removed them from the Downloads folder, removed the /Firefox folder from user/Library/Application Support/, and emptying the Trash. </p><p>I saw in one Support post to delete the fbplugin file, 'as that had been causing Firefox to crash'. The closest I found to an 'fbplugin' file was a bundle-config.1 file, which contained 'fbplugin' throughout the file code numerous times. I renamed it temporarily, but didn't delete it. That didn't help the non-opening problem either.   </p><p>I also tried installing Firefox v 71, same result as the others. </p><p>Keep in mind after attempting all of these solutions of deleting, reinstalling, changing file names, etc., I did a complete shutdown and restart.  Also, I have not downloaded, updated, or changed anything since last week's phenomenon of regular Firefox beginning to work again.  So I'm completely stumped and would appreciate any help.

In other words, with this feature, if a link is opened from a page in container X, but the link does not have a container associated with it, the tab would open in the default container rather than container X.  To give a concrete example:  My Google searches &amp; news are in a Google container.  When I click a search result, e.g., from a news organization that I don't visit enough to make a container for, I'd prefer it did not open in the Google container, but a different, generic one or No Container. </p><p>I realize there could be some odd side-effects if a site spans multiple domains or hosts if they're not all marked for one container, but as an optional feature I think it wouldn't bother people who don't want to deal with that possibility. </p><p>Another way to do something similar would be to allow users to mark a container as ""exclusive,"" meaning any link not in the sites assigned to that container would automatically go to No Container in the absence of an assignment.  These two options also be implemented and work together. </p><p>Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this or if there's already a way to do this that I just haven't found.

As a Low vision individual I do rely on Windows High contrast black theme to remove any bright color blocks from the screen background. Unfortunately the new Readability backplate feature brings these color blocks back which actually make websites harder for me to read.  For example buttons, image blocks with or without wording  now appear in white background which is precisely what I need to move away from. Can I disable the readability backplate or disable background images? In the mean time how do I go back to version 72.# please?

This add on not only put tabs not in use into hibernation, but when you closed a tab it went into a recent tab list. Now Firefox browser does the same, but when the browser is closed the list is deleted, but with Tab Utilities the list remained. If there was tabs you wanted to delete you could click on it with your mouse's right button. If you wanted to pull up a tab you hit the tab with your mouse's left button and the tab would once more be on the tab work bar in the same place it was once before. In this ""recently closed"" list you could edit the amount of tabs you desired in the list and the tabs were in hibernation, as such using very little energy and little interference with speed besides freeing up your work tab bar. The author of the add on eventually quit and the add on became incompatible after Firefox version 44 and is disabled on installing the newer versions.  So many of us are having an older version of Firefox. Some of us would like to get the newer version of Firefox. Currently, the only options we have in locating  a newer add on similar to Tab Utilities is by installing a newer version of Firefox, and losing all we had, and install new add ons hopefully finding what we desire.  So, we (it is not just me, but a large group of people I am in contact with) are searching for some new add on that is similar to Tab Utilities so we can move on to the newer Firefox versions.

Task Manager also only lists the processes, no applications. This process is very hard to kill, Task Manager can't end it, nor elevated rights Command Prompt TASKKILL with /FE, NirSoft NirCmd nor PSTools pskill64.exe nor Process Explorer. I have also tried ending all the other processes first I can think of, including explorer.exe, does not help.

For couple of weeks ago it updated with a new user interface and installed new components. To test that, I tried to uninstall Avira. Each component needs to be uninstalled separately using Windows Programs and Features: two components uninstalled cleanly, one component left an open minimized window that one couldn't pop open nor close. Antivirus and VPN do not uninstall: after you are asked do you want to uninstall and answer YES, nothing else visible happens. If you try to start another uninstall job, you get a window telling you can't start another as one program is already being uninstalled or changed. And waiting doesn't help. I have a support question about it in Avira forum. </p><p>Also last week, Flash Player installation failed with 89% done, tried twice and with same result. And the newest GeForce Graphics adapter drivers installation failed also. Both of those usually always install succesfully. </p><p>Microsoft System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW does not find problems, nor does Windows disc chechker tool. I also run: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab and Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Avira support recommends the Install and Uninstall troubleshooter to get rid of some old Avira rubbish. Also compared Windows folders rights to default rights listed in some web site: did not find differences with the couple of dozen folders I compared. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) according to Process Explorer is enabled looking at Firefox.exe process properties. I know command lines to change DEP settings and found it in System Performance Properties settings also, but have not touched it. </p><p>I've removed Firefox and Thunderbird parent.lock -files, with Firefoxilla both from profile folder C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME and temporary folder C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox before trying to start Firefox again. And since I can't kill the process otherwise, it also means after rebooting the computer. </p><p>Found an advice opening Firefox with SHIFT-key down, should open a safe-mode of the browser. Well, opened only the process in my case. </p><p>There are no previous session related saves (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js) in the profile folder any more, and the sessionstore-backups folder is empty. </p><p>I removed the Firefox installation, rebooted, and installed the 73.0 version 13.02.2020. It behaves similarly: only the process starts. </p><p>Added -p parameter to the Firefox shortcut, and in Windows SAFE MODE  was able to create a new profile: in normal mode Windows the window for creating/changing profile does not open. Firefox doesn't open application window in Windows safe mode either, also tried to run it as administrator option, and pressing SHIFT key, but neither helped. The newly created profile folder only has one file: times.json. </p><p>When installed Firefox again, it wasn't a clean installation: the Firefox folder was empty of files, but I did install into the same folder. Also did not edit register nor delete the profile folder. Which is what I'm gonna try next. However, Thunderbird does not use Firefox's profile, so why does it stop opening the application window same time with Firefox? I don't think Firefox's profile folder can cause all these installation problems and Thunderbird problem. My bet is more likely Avira. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;avira;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1291380;,pelihemmo

1280079,2020-02-17 07:28:58 -0800,2020-02-17T07:28:58Z,"Mozilla Firefox ja Thunderbird, prosessi käynnistyy mutta sovellusikkuna ei aukea","<p>En muuten päässyt Internet Exploderilla tänne tukisivuille: sivu jossa tunnus luodaan ei auennut. Koska itsellä Firefox ei toimi, en ole omalla koneellani, kun täällä foorumilla olen. Joten jos tähän viestiin automaattisesti jotain tietoja lisätään... tulee väärästä koneesta. </p><p>Vajaa viikko sitten Mozilla Firefox ja Thunderbird lakkasivat aukeamasta: vain prosessi - Firefox.exe tai Thunderbird.exe - käynnistyy (näkyvissä Tehtävien hallinnassa (Task Managerissa)) mutta sovellusikkuna ei aukea, eikä myöskään ole listattuna Task Managerin sovelluksissa. Prosessi on myös vaikeasti tapettava: sitä ei saa lopetettua Task Managerista eikä ohjelmilla jotka on tarkoitettu prosessien lopettamiseen: järjestelmänvalvojan oikeuksilla avatussa komentokehoitteessa TASKKILL PID /FE, NirSoft NirCmd ja PSTools pskill64.exe tai Process Explorer. Vaikka käynnistysongelma on molemmilla Mozillan ohjelmilla, olen koittanut ratkoa sitä lähinnä Firefoxin kanssa. </p><p>Ympäristö: Pöytäkone, Windows 7 PRO 64bit eng. kielinen, AMD:n Phenom II prossu, GeForce 1050Ti näyttis, ja kaksi järjestelmänvalvojan tason tunnusta on joilla olen hommaa ratkonut. </p><p>Virustorjuntana Avira Free Antivirus, joka voi olla jopa syntipukki. Siitä tuli nimittäin viikko-pari sitten uudella käyttöliittymällä oleva päivitys, jossa oli muitakin uusia komponentteja. Olen koittanut poistaa sen asennusta, mutta kaksi komponenttia siitä ei suostu Windowsin Programs and Features -asennuksen poistolla katoamaan: Antivirus ja VPN. Tukikysely siitä menossa Aviran foorumilla. </p><p>Viime viikolla epäonnistui myös Adobe Flash-player asennus (pysähtyi 89% kohtaan) sekä GeForce näytönohjaimen ajureiden päivitys uusimpaan versioon. </p><p>System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW ei löydä ongelmia, eikä Windows levynkorjaustyökalu. Kokeilin myös Microsoftin työkaluja: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab sekä Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Install ja Uninstall troublesooter -työkalulla koitin poistaa myös mahdollisesti wanhojen Aviran asennusten jäämiä (Aviran tuki suosittelee myös niin tekemään). Vertailin myös Windows kansioiden käyttäjäoikeuksia alkuperäisiin (Netistä löytyi sivu jolla niistä on listaus) enkä havainnut erilaisuuksia niissä muutamassa tusinassa jonka tarkistin. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) näkyi olevan Process Explorerin mukaan olevan päällä (Enabled) Firefox-prosessinkin ominaisuuksia katsoessa, en ole siihen itse kajonnut, löysin kyllä sen asetuksen Windowsin järjestelmän suorituskyvyn ominaisuuksista, ja komentokehoiteohjeet, jos nyt siitä kiikastaisi.   </p><p>Firefoxista ja Thunderbirdistä olen poistanut parent.lock -tiedostot, Firefoxilla sekä profiilikansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME sekä väliaikaistalletusten kansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox ennen kuin olen käynnistänyt selainta uudestaan, ja koska prosessia ei saa tapettua, se tarkoittaa siis että aina koneen uudelleenkäynnistymisen jälkeen. </p><p>Löysin neuvon avata Firefox klikkaamalla kuvaketta ja pitämällä SHIFT-näppäintä pohjassa, mutta sillä ei ollut eroa mun tapauksessani: vain prosessi käynnistyy. </p><p>Profiilista olen poistanut edellisen istunnon tiedostot (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js) ja sessionstore-backups kansio on tyhjä. </p><p>Poistin Firefoxin asennuksen, boottasin ja asensin uusimman 73.0 version 13.02.2020. Sama ongelma jatkui senkin kanssa. </p><p>Lisäsin kuvakkeeseen käynnistyspolun perään -P argumentin, ja Windowsin SAFE-modessa sillä sai käynnistymään ikkunan jossa voi luoda uuden profiilin ja valita mitä profiilia käytetään. Jos käynnisti Windowsin normaalisti, niin tuokaan ikkuna ei aukea. Firefox ei kyllä käynnistynyt Windowsin SAFE-modessakaan. Kokeilin myös Run as administrator ja SHIFT-napin kanssa, mutta ei käynnisty. Uuteen profiiliin tuli vain yksi ainoa tiedosto: times.json. </p><p>Kun asensin uuden version Firefoxista, se ei ollut aivan ""clean Install"", eli asensin saman nimiseen kansioon, joka kyllä oli tyhjä tiedostoista, enkä käynyt rekisteriä läpi, enkä poistanut edellistä profiilia. Mikä lieneekin seuraava yritys. Joku neuvoi myös place.sqlite -tiedostoa poistamaan/uudelleennimeämään, jota voin kanssa kokeilla. Tässä on nyt kuitenkin huomionarvoista se, että Firefoxin lisäksi Thunderbird alkoi samalla hetkellä käyttäytymään samalla tavalla. Ja sehän ei ilmeisesti mitenkään Firefoxin profiilia käytä, joten epäilen kyllä Aviraakin enemmän kuin että Firefoxin profiili olisi tähän kaikkeen syypää. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,fi,"",pelihemmo

Note that the body of the mail is formatted regularly, and that also the icons at the bottom (say, an attachment) are magnified disproportionately. </p><p>There is an archived post in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176032"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176032</a> that reports a similar problem. However, the diagnose is different. The large icon is not an issue of yahoo mail on two counts: 1) the big X and printer icons are supposed to be there, and the issue is that they are magnified without a reason; 2) the problem does not arise with the same webmail service in other computers. I suspect that it must be some local setting of Firefox that has been changed in a mistake?  </p><p>Any ideas on fixes and workarounds?

But when moving it to the other monitor/ opening a new window on the other monitor it would not scale properly, but render according to the scaling factor of the other monitor. So, e.g. when moving from the internal to the external screen it would only render to the top left quarter of the screen, while the application was actually being the right size. At the same time the input mapping was according to the actual window dimensions, and not according to the visual rendering of Firefox. This would also happen the other way round, with Firefox then only rendering the top left part of the web page to the entire screen. </p><p>You can see this well on the attached screenshot, but notice that sway is a tiling window manager, so Firefox should actually be exactly the same size as the terminal next to it. Firefox also renders like this when the scaling factor was changed at run time, so the issue seems to me that Firefox on Wayland checks the scaling factor on startup just once globally and does not realize when it was changed or that it can be different on different monitors. </p>",firefox-740;beta;desktop;fix-problems;linux;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1300595;,freddy.wiehl

Still, when I click on a the link I was testing this with, it asks me ""What should Firefox do with this file?"" and if I manually select ""Open with...Other...Firefox,"" it will open in Firefox but still download to my PC.  Am I right that the user experience should always be that it automatically opens a new tab and displays the PDF there while NOT downloading to the user's PC?  That being said, I tested another random PDF and it did what it was supposed to.  I only tested these 2 after I did the fixes so I don't have a high sample size to say if it mostly works or mostly doesn't.

I have used this forum for more than 18 years and this is the first time this has happened, The site is a respected one, and a search for 'MSDN Forum' would provide a link(s) to my problem site. After a LOT of work trying to find what has happened has resulted in my finding that scripts and CSS seem to be skipped from being loaded by Firefox reporting the error message I mention in the title. These errors are MANY thoughout the incoming data. I subsequently tried to pursue Mozilla articles on Mixed Content Blocking, which seems to say Ishould have an option to 'disable' Firefox security with respect to the above via clicking on the 'sheild' icon and follow through to where there is supposed to be am option to 'stop/disble' - but there is no such option here so I can't check if that option is a cause of my issue. This issue is very severe as it disable ALL of the needed buttons - such as Reply, Quote and Post New Question - for a Forum, that is indeed severe! Now, I don't know if this whole issue is a fault with either Microsoft (who seem to be serving faulty data, or, Firefox for being overly coseting) I attach an image showing a portion of the errors (they extend throughout the entire list). Patricularly, the line at the top saying the Style Sheet could not be loaded summarizes the whole issue. Is there any other way I can get to disable Firefox being overly protective - I do know how to use the About:Config etc., but lack the ability to find anything relevant to this issue in any of the content there. </p><p>A further snippet of information: amongst other things, I reinstalled Window 10 and used Edge immediately after install had completed - same issues (suggesting that either both browsers are overly protective, or that the issues stem from Microsoft). I have tried most/all of the things likely to be suggested here suxh as using Safe Mode, no Extensions etc. </p><p>To save readers from becoming bored with this long essay, I'll stop here - if further info needed, just ask. </p>",firefox-730;websites;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,websites,en-US,1289487;1289908;1289924;1290123;1290743;,leshayathome

When I do the same in a published desktop for this customer without altering the settings everything is working fine. I tried resetting the  application settings but to no avail.

Until recently, I could open Gmail and see my main email account and I could go to YouTube and automatically be login with my YouTube Gmail account. I refreshed Firefox and now when I open YouTube it asks me to sign in, when I do it changes my login in Gmail, so I have to re-login to Gmail to my main email account. When I re-login to Gmail, it signs me out of YouTube into the other Gmail account! It goes back and forth wasting time. I would be grateful to fix this to save the wasted time it takes to keep having to login back and forth. I've been searching for an answer and haven't found a good solution yet. All I've found are frustrated people in various threads. My Android phone is able to keep my Gmail account logged in and my other Gmail account logged into Youtube but, on my mac computer on Firefox it no longer keeps them separate. It seems to have happened after I refreshed Firefox recently. </p><p>I look forward to hearing if there is a solution.

It doesnt work for new sites or sites that redirect to you a slightly different subdomain and it is F-ing annoying. I posted this almost a year and though the question has been closed, it hasnt been fixed. So attempt #2. </p><p>Original post (which is now 10 months old): Firefox has changed the way its URL auto fill works a while ago. (At least-3 months ago; I remember stumbling on a reddit post from Sep 16th saying that it should be fixed with v63, which is why I waited to try it out.) It seems to be mostly with redirects, see examples below, but also with new sites: it seems to only auto complete after you visited a new site at least twice. I'm a fairly advanced user, so I'm quite convinced I've checked all possible solutions, like check settings in about:config, do a clean install, etc. Also, this behaviour has changed on both my computers and my new work pc. </p><p>I'm fairly certain it used to work like it still does in Pale Moon, which is my preferred method Examples: 1. If you go to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a> you're forwarded to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>. If you now close the tab and type 'ste' PM autofills it to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a>, Fx does not. It does suggest the page, but does not auto complete it (it does, however, autofill 'sto' to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>). </p><p>2. The same thing happens for <a href=""http://chrome.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chrome.google.com</a>, which redirects to <a href=""http://google.com/chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com/chrome</a> </p><p>3. <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a> forwards to <a href=""http://ikea.com/nl/nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com/nl/nl/</a>. PM autofills 'ik' to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>, Fx, again, does not. It _does_ auto fill to <a href=""http://ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com</a>, which is doubly annoying, because now you have to click 'to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>' every time. </p><p>So, is this change by design?

I used firefox (72.0.2, 64 bit, Windows 7 with two users account) up to two days ago but yesterday it started to crash on every boot. It isn't possible to start FF in safe mode; I tried to uninstall completely FF (also the file in C:\program files etc.) and reinstall but the crashes continue. I run a memtest (memtest86) and the memory is Ok. The only way to run FF is in Windows safe mode (I'm writing with FF in Windows safe mode). I'd like to continue using FF in the future but I can't do it... Could you help me?

NOT the password, just the user name and address ...","<p>I am not even sure how in the world to explain what info I need. Please be patient, because I don't want a bunch of answers that don't answer this very important question to me: when you type in your email, or user name, which ever is required to log into a website, how it is that the user name is remembered? Which part of the browser is recalling the user name and how do you stop it? I never ever allow browsers to remember/retain passwords. Now, I am having real concern about the part of the browser that recalls user name and whatever else. I went to log into a site, Amazon, and I usually don't even have to type the full email when my full email appears. It is a common thing for all of us. But I see a half dozen of my other emails and possible user names -- as though someone was trying to log in and used a name that I would never use. It was abusive, too. I have a strong feeling, too, that this mozilla site, some people in this site,  do not honor people's privacy. I cannot see how in the world anyone could create something like that otherwise.  You would have to have access to an individual's browser in their notebook, and use it to try to log into sites, there were a few of them, using various user names.  How can one do that? Well some of those people who lurk around here pretending to help, but don't have enough to do and don't know what being professional means. Anyone here who would dare violate anyone's privacy can be charged with a crime. that is theft and worse. To use someone's browser to try to log into sites like Amazon.  To be guessing at user names, and making some up. I never use anything but what I actually use, so to see my emails and usernames, PLUS made up names that someone thinks they might use, or someone here thinks oh this woujld be funny, is the worst kind of business that will get mozilla right off the map here.  Please how do I get in touch with the creators of this? I can take a screen shot.  I have done that before. No browser recalls any thing unless it is has been used and is stored. That is how the user name is recalled, but how could that happen if I never used that specific name? Who could have done that? Please if I need to explain better, ask. This is very important.  Very important. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-720;desktop;windows-7;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1287001;1287038;1287210;1287386;1287517;1287521;1287529;1287550;1287608;1287616;1287619;1287704;,GINAHERE

But I am afraid it's gonna change soon.  I lost my laptop, it was stolen.  I store my history from a couple of years, bookmarks, saved passwords.  I had a backup by MozBackup on May 2019.  On December I copied a profile as it was written in your guides: (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles</a>)  I copied everything from: %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ I hadn't investigate what is inside. And after i bought a new laptop I had many problems with Firefox, can someone explain me please:  1. I couldn't login to Sync, due i hadn't remembered my password - ok its my fault, but when i wanted to reset i would lose all my data?! Why is that? I can understand due to its encrypted but... Luckly after some combination i recovered my password.  2. So i copied my profile as it was written in your guide, and i hadn't investigate what is inside. Now when i tried to copy my whole profile its not working, why? Well, i checked and there were no file: places.sqlite . I have no clue why, so my backup from December is lost.  3. You informed people about Syncing, why there is nowhere information that you syncing history, yes, but only 2 months??!! You claim that we will have bookmarks, saved passwords, cache and history yes thats true, but history for only 8 weeks..... I understand that it has many bytes to store, but it should be somewhere information about it! If i would knew that i would be more prepared for lost, and did more often proper backup by MozBackup.  I feel now very frustrated about this situation, and first time after 14 years I'm very, very disappointed with Firefox. Can someone explain me please, why is that?  Thank you for reply!

Occasionally, I would prefer to open PDFs in the browser. However, if I select Firefox instead of Acrobat Reader from the dialog box, I get the same dialog again, because Firefox--rightly--interprets this as another request to open a PDF and since my preferences are ""Always ask,"" that's what it does. I would like to be able to tell it not to ask in this one instance, while retaining my preference generally. I don't see a way to do this. </p><p>There are a couple of possible workarounds, none of which is entirely satisfactory. I could set my preferences to Preview in Firefox, and then if I prefer to open in Acrobat right-click, select Save As, and then open the local file. This is less than ideal because it adds a few steps and reverses my order of preference (most of the time I want to be asked so I can either open in Acrobat or save the file).  </p><p>I could change my preferences on those rare occasions when I want to preview the file in Firefox but, again, this adds steps.  </p><p>I could set the preferences to open the file in the browser and then click the download option. This might be the shortest workaround--just adds one step--but it is still an extra step and, again, reverses my preferred order.  </p><p>I suspect there's no solution to this because it requires Firefox to be able to distinguish between a general preference and a specific preference, and that would(?) require extensive additional coding. But I figured I'd ask in case I'm overlooking something.

Prior to this, every week I would load a page containing a one or two-sided weekly bulletin, that would fit conveniently on a sheet of A4 paper. Then I would then tweak the scaling to get the best possible fit of the items before printing. But now every time I try this, whether on my desktop or laptop, it comes out with strange font sizes that appear to require substantially more or less scaling to get a fit. With enough tweaking, I can get the preview looking OK: but then, when printed, the actual layout is completely different! It looks as if the paper sizing information has been corrupted somehow: but I have already tried resetting the 'Firefox printer setting', then 'all Firefox printer settings;' and finally a complete deinstall and reinstall. But none of these have cured the problem. I have been assured that the page I have been attempting to print has not been altered recently: and in any case the problem appears not to be limited to that one page. This preview and scaling feature has been one of the great plus features of Firefox for me. I don't know any other browser that normally does this so well: but now I'm desperately looking for any workable solution.

Daha önceleri ayarladığım sitelere kullanıcı adı/parola sormadan giriş yapıyordum ancak artık yapamıyorum. Asıl ilginç olanı da dediğim gibi sitelerin hiçbirini hatırlamıyor (sanki yeni kurulmuş gibi) ancak herhangi bir siteye girip oturum aç dediğim zaman kullanıcı adı ve şifremi hatırlıyor. Yaklaşık 10-15 gündür aynı sorun devam etmekte. Firefox'u yeniledim olmadı. Sildim ve baştan kurdum yine olmadı. Firefox'u eski haline nasıl getirebilirim?
