Firefox developers, if you're reading this, please fix this printing issue. While you're at it, please add an inbuilt webpage translation tool. Nobody want to copy and past webpages to translate them. I really want to stick with Mozilla, but you have to improve these little features within the browser.  </p><p>Actually never mind, cannot attach the pdf to show the issue in this forum.

The only sure fix is to log out and restart the computer. It nearly, but not always, works the first time. My Acer has Windows 10 and is about 6-months old. I don't know if it's related, but the Bluetooth app is dropped occasionally. A reboot doesn't help, but it does sometimes recover after a few days, for no apparent reason. </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1303836;,bwsweeney451

He reinstalado navegador, siempre está actualizado, y solo sucede con Mozilla, he probado con otros navegadores como IExplore, Chrome, Opera... pero solo Mozilla me genera ese error. Si arrastro imágenes de una carpeta a WhatsApp o FB a través de Mozilla sí me lo permite. </p><p>Aparte de eso en muchas ocasiones se vuelve lentísimo en exceso, al punto que ni videos de FB o YouTube puedo reproducir y debo reiniciar navegador, y si uso cualquier otro navegador sí me lo permite normalmente, por ello he comprobado que no influye calidad de video ni ancho de banda de internet, por cierto, mi conexión a internet es por cable. </p><p>La última vez que reinstalé Windows 7 fue hace ya como unos 6 meses, pero igual sucede el fallo desde antes del formateo y he revisado la configuración de seguridad pero no encuentro nada relacionado al fallo... De hecho por si está la duda, no tengo antivirus. </p><p>Estaré pendiente a cualquier respuesta que me ayude en la solución del fallo. </p><p>Gracias! </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,es,1304719;1304788;1304943;1305116;1305157;,jra_

I know that the common answer to this question is ""contact the web site owner and get them to upgrade""  But what happens when I am the website owner, as I own the piece hardware with the https administration interface? I can't upgrade the device because the webserver is built into the firmware, The vendor says the fix is to purchase a new device (at a $$$$$), however the device is still able to perform its task as not much has changed in the industry in the last 20 years except that I'm no longer able to connect to the admin interface. If the device used HTTP I wouldn't have a problem, but because it uses an old HTTPS.  I'm starting to get worried as the work arounds are saying this wont be supported in the future. </p><p>Have you guys considered this scenario?
