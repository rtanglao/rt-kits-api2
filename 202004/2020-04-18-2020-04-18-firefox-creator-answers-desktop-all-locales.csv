Some websites that used to load when I clicked on their links in e-mail messages didn't load any more. This was most obvious with e-mails from Pinterest, but happened with some other links as well. Clicking on the link brought up a completely blank page, with nothing in the address bar.  I tried navigating to Pinterest directly, through the Search bar, and couldn't do it - I got the usual list of sites but clicking on them did nothing.  Clicking old links that dropped down in the address bar didn't work, either. Copying the links into Chrome brought me to the Pinterest site, and also an Atlantic article I couldn't reach through FireFox, without any problem. I've already tried eliminating AddIns, checking my Firewall settings, clearing my Cache and Cookies, turning off DNS pre-fetching, and the other suggestions in the ""Firefox can't load websites but other browsers can"" Help article.   NOTE: The problem is limited to only some websites.  In particular, I haven't had any trouble with Facebook, or most news websites, or YouTube. </p>",firefox-750;other;desktop;windows-7;,firefox,other,en-US,"",grappolt

The dropdown would be alright, except when you actually wanted to click a bookmark. now you can press escape, but the searchbar uncomfortably hovers over the bookmark bar, which gives me a weird kind of claustrophobia. Even worse when you want to deactivate that hover you have to click somewhere on the site, not just on the free empty space left or right of the searchbar. And guess how much fun it is finding a spot to click that is not a link... </p>",firefox-750;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1306912;,Christoph.Wolf1988
