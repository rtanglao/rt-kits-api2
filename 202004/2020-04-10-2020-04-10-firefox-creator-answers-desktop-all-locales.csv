It seems like the best reasons to use Firefox are being taken away by Mozilla. Is there a new browser that addresses the concerns Firefox addressed in the past, i.e. not being a politician to a company obsessed with taking over your browser experience for their own advertising income? Firefox has nice features but I'd rather lose a few features if that's required to lose the forced advertising and/or forced extra steps to avoid using their ""partner"" program.
