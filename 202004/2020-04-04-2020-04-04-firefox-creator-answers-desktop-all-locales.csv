To monitor progress I clicked the arrow at the top right. A small window appears showing progress of the downoad. Problem 1 : that window disappears after a while and there is no way to make it appear again To continue monitoring the progress of the download I used Tools &gt; Downloads. A window appears showing progress of the download. Problem 2 : After a while that window shows continuously the same information : 'Time remaining' gets frozen for ever on the same value; 'rate of incoming data' flips forever between 2 same values. Good news is that the download progresses even though Firefox no longer reports its progress. Click anywhere on the screen and the window resumes a correct display of the progress. Until next time it frozes again ... I got my download all right. But having Firefox reporting reliably on its progress would be nice. Thanks. </p>",firefox-740;other;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1302482;,nuno_ferreira

But I will take my chances with the Russian hackers when I'm viewing a video (with Ubuntu, no less, which isn't so easy to invade with worms and Trojan horses).
