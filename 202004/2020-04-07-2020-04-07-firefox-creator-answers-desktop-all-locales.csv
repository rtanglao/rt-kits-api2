No Gmail loading icon or anything. However, I can access my other Gmail accounts, and when using a private window I can access my default account. The issue is not present on Chrome, but Chrome isn't my default browser as of now and until now I've found Firefox preferable. It doesn't appear to be any of my extensions, because disabling them and exiting Firefox made no difference. I've cleared my cache and cookies and it didn't resolve the issue. Ultimately, switching browsers is an option. It's just my last resort. </p>",firefox-740;websites;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,websites,en-US,1303304;1303415;,commanderhoek37

To get this research back, I am using Sync - but none of the original windows was preserved.  Instead there is just a long list of all of the tabs I had open across all the windows I had open.  Why does Sync not preserve the separate windows?  With well over a hundred tabs open, this makes recovering/accessing this information very tedious - as all the tabs have to be opened individually, and then sorted into separate windows again, to be bookmarked in their search subject categories/windows!  Was this just an oversight, or is it technically not possible to preserve separate windows in Sync?   </p><p>If it is technically not possible to preserver multiple windows of tabs in Sync, it would be much more workable if it were possible to mark these tabs in Sync to re-open them, rather than have to open them individually or all of the tabs at once from that other machine.
