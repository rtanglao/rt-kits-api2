What is the fix?,"<p>Entire YouTube pages loads normally, including recommended videos, comments, etc. Video screen remains black, with the ""worm chasing its tail"" indicating it is buffering. The buffering goes on indefinitely, with video never running. Pointing to the bar at bottom of screen, thumbnail images appear showing what WOULD BE showing if the video actually worked at all. Buffer forever, run video never has been the norm since update around April 1, 2020. Wife's PC was okay until few moments ago. Hers just installed the update, which coincided with YouTube videos doing same as mine. Is there any way to undue the update? I'd prefer taking my chance wuith whatever ""security threat"" than to lose use of the computer. Rendering unusable for security seems poor tradeoff. </p>",firefox-740;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",fang_zamillion

Including remote programs, etc. </p><p>So, you set a oligarch password, and all is good.   Or is it? </p><p>Here's my concern: </p><p>You go to a site and it asks you for your login/password.  They are either saved or you save them. You are prompted for the oligarch password and they are either saved or retrieved. </p><p>You go to another site and the saved log in is auto-completed with no input from you. That's good in that scenario. </p><p>But say you get some nasty software. It starts looking through your saved logins. </p><p>What is stopping it basically getting them all without your knowledge? </p><p>My suggestion is - though some may complain - that even if you have entered your oligarch password, when a site requests access to your saved logins (or how ever it works) you are told with a simple ""Site log in requested"". </p><p>I may be wrong in my concerns but I feel it is worth asking/mentioning so the problem can be addressed or my fears allayed. </p><p>Thanks very much in advance. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;linux;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1302431;1302433;1302434;1302435;1302451;,teeny_weeny
1283471,2020-04-03 13:28:33 -0800,2020-04-04T10:38:50Z,How do I prevent a popup after my own mouseclick (websites designed to cause this),"<p>1.  Where is the top level ""community forum""?  I've spent 10 or 15 minutes wandering around a maze of Mozilla support pages without ever getting to a top level ""now you can look at postings"" page.   So... I'm stuck posting to ask where I could've avoided posting.    </p><p>2.   And the actual question at last!!  ;)   One of my favorite websites for news, <a href=""http://thehill.com"" rel=""nofollow"">thehill.com</a>, places annoying ads to partially obscure the text that you're trying to read.  Sometimes (25%?) of the time when you click the ""X"" box, they then fire off a pop up.  Now, this pop a) comes from an ad pretending to be a window and b) is a result of my mouse click.   So the fact that I can find the setting menu and turn on the pop up blocker is not helpful, as discussed in the appropriate support page:   </p><p>Is the pop-up shown after a mouse click or a key press? </p><p>Certain events, such as clicking or pressing a key, can spawn pop-ups regardless of if the pop-up blocker is on. This is intentional,        so that Firefox doesn't block pop-ups that websites need to work. </p><p>Is it a true pop-up window? </p><p>Sometimes ads are designed to look like windows, but really aren't. Firefox's pop-up blocker can't stop these ads.  </p><p>So what we have at last is a second-level question: now that we know the built-in pop up blocker is not the solution, is there one out there?  A plug-in perhaps?  Or perhaps soneone direct me to the forums and an appropriate discussion of (presumably NOT the popup blocker) the mechanism by which this is solved?   </p><p>Thanks for any courteous replies in advance, Craig </p><p>PS: Amusing contradiction here... how am I going to find the answers...   hmmm.... </p>",firefox-740;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1302458;1302601;,craigwbarzzz

I open firefox with google search. I start to enter a search but the oligarch password box pops up and I find I am typing my search query in the M P box. If I cancel it it just pops up again. This is before I even get to any site. When there it will come up again when following a link in that site and so on. This is very annoying and I am considering dumping firefox because of it. Please don't tell me to do the M password replacement procedure IT DOES NOT WORK. I have also tried editing the registry but that failed also.
