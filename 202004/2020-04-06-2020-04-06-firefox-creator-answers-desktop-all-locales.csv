I feel that Ia m being driven back to Chrome, tho I support FF on web freedom and security. It is a very frustrating situation. Any help would be much appreciated. </p>",bookmarks;desktop;linux;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1302950;1302957;,roycstannard

They also have instructions on where to enable it in the Add-ons Manager Plugins panel, ellipsis icon next to Widevine Content Decryption Module provided by Google Inc.  </p><p>On the Add-ons Manager Plugins panel I don’t have Widevine listed. I see “OpenH264” and “Shockwave flash” but I do not see “Widevine Content Decryption Module provided by Google”. </p><p>It also said that you can always turn DRM playback on again by opening the Firefox Preferences General panel and, under “Digital Rights Management (DRM) Content”, putting a check mark next to “Play DRM-controlled content”. I don’t have “Digital Rights Management (DRM) Content” listed on the General panel.  </p><p>I assumed that Widevine didn’t install on demand. So I found another forum that explained how to download the zip file from Google. I did the following steps to get the latest file and I put it in the plugins folder.  </p><p>sudo wget <a href=""https://dl.google.com/widevine-cdm/1.4.9.1088-linux-x64.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.google.com/widevine-cdm/1.4.9.1088-linux-x64.zip</a> </p><p>sudo unzip 1.4.9.1088-linux-x64.zip </p><p>sudo mv <a href=""http://libwidevinecdm.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libwidevinecdm.so</a> /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins </p><p>sudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins/<a href=""http://libwidevinecdm.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libwidevinecdm.so</a> </p><p>Still it doesn’t appear in my Plugins.  </p><p>Questions: </p><pre>   • Do I need Widevine to play Amazon Music Unlimited?    • If I do, how do I install Widevine? </pre>",firefox-750;beta;customize;desktop;linux;,firefox,customize,en-US,1302955;1302958;,sian1
