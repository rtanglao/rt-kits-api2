It is reported secure, see first image, it also says which CA verified the certificate. All seems well but if I click on more information, i get what is shown on the second image, firefox suddenly reports that the site is not encrypted. The website runs on IIS. This happens with both internal CA issued certificate (the ca is imported into firefox as trustworthy root) as well as with letsencrypt issued certificate. Neither internet explorer nor chrome find any anomalies and report the site as trustworthy and all certificates in order. Why is this happening and what is the cause?
