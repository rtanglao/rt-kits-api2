Of course clicking the CAPTCHA box so soon after successfully getting through it immediately produces a green check-mark without having to deal with any more images, yet Firefox still stomps on me with a ""resend"" box, ENDLESSLY.  </p><p>Clicking ""cancel"" instead of resend brings no relief.

On both, sync is set to sync passwords/logins. I see that the sync is complete in both. </p><p>Now I see that *a few* passwords/logins are missing in the *new* Firefox. Some are there, some are not. I can see this by comparing the search results for some logins on the old Firefox (under Options/Security/Saved logins) and the new Firefox (under Logins and Passwords). </p><p>From what I see, the same passwords are in fact also missing from my android Firefox (68.7.0). </p><p>I suppose the cause may be connected to the difference in versions between the two Firefox. But why are some logins still synced then? </p><p>My questions are: </p><p>- Since I cannot update the old Firefox, how can I import the missing passwords to the new Firefox? </p><p>- Is it maybe possible to import them by copying the key3.db and logins.json files? Must I follow any specific steps to copy them? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",firefox-750;sync;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,sync,en-US,1308150;1308319;,pglpm
