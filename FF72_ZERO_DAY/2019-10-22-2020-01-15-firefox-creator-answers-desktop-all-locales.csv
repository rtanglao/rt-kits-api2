</p><p>Firefox Version: 72.0.1

</p>
<ol><li> create a self-signed CA certificate and server certificate for localhost;
</li><li> create a server which serve https service with certificate and key above;
</li><li> request localhost, Firefox would warn that connection is not secure, which is ok;
</li><li> install CA certificate to Firefox certificates store and restart Firefox;

</p><p>Firefox still trust a server certificate signed by a CA whose certificate is deleted from Firefox's trust authorities.

As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser, as when I checked Waterfox Classic (The only version I could see offered when I went to check the site to get the browser) to see if those problems followed to it, I learned it did not. However for some reason, Waterfox does not have access to the same extensions I normally use in Firefox. Is there a reason behind this? I am planning to downgrade to the immediate preceeding version of Firefox I have to see if that fixes the issues there but I somehow doubt it. In the meantime, is there a way to get my Noscript, Adblock Plus, and Webroot Filtering extensions to work on Waterfox so that I can use it in the without worrying about ads or potentially malicious scripts until I can figure out what the devil happened to Firefox?

</p><p>I will try to summarize the essence: immediately after installing Firefox (from <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.mozilla.org</a>) on ​​my PC, I tried to enable the synchronization in order to (including) download my extensions that I used previously on other devices. After that, I found that none of them could be installed (they did not even appear in the Add-ons Manager list). In addition, I noticed that the list of recommended add-ons from the Manager's is displayed incorrectly (there are no preview images). When I tried to download a add-on manually from the list by clicking the ""+ Add to Firefox"" button, I received a pop-up message that ""The add-on could not be downloaded of a connection failure"" (I use a wired connection (Ethernet) to my PC, without any restrictions. At this point, I was using Chrome in parallel without any problems). I tried to go to (<a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a>) and found the same behavior. Images were not displayed and extensions were not downloaded (Download failed. Please check your connection.).
</p><p>What I tried to do to solve the problem: reset the default settings; disable syncing; run in Safe Mode; delete Firefox entirely, and install it again. But all these actions did not solve my problem.
</p><p>I will be grateful to anyone who can answer me. I'm counting on you.

The problem is this; when I reopen firefox after either 
A) having shut down my laptop, or 
B) having simply 'quit' firefox, 
I must enter my email address and password again, then enter my phone number so that it can send me a text to the link to the firefox app for my phone (which I have installed), then finally I can navigate firefox as normal and my websites and history are remembered. However, it is not really ""as normal"" because I have to SIGN INTO the websites again. Sometimes it remembers the username and password and all I have to do is click through it, but sometimes it doesn't and I have to manually sign into them. Bookmarks aren't ever saved either. I have attached the screenshot of the screen that comes up every time I reopen firefox and this problem happens. I did not have this problem on my older firefox instillation, just when I updated to the newest version. It is so irritating. If anyone can tell me what to do so that this does not happen, and it remembers me, I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

Recently started having major problems with running ANYTHING after streaming some video.  Complained to the streaming web site but then realized it might be that Firefox had been changed somehow with all its ""updates"".  When I looked into Firefox cache clearing I discovered there was already 1.0 Gigabytes of garbage in my cache from a very brief video streaming access following from a warm reboot of my computer needed to get anything at all to run properly.  Downloaded the apparent ""new"" addon called ""ClearCache"" but wanted to check whether my guess is correct that the years functional cache clearing has now been separated out and that the new addon will solve my operational problem after streaming video.

Our company uses a proxy in whitelisting mode. 
Until recently, clicking any HTTPS link unauthorized by proxy (403 by Squid) would result in an unambiguous error page informing the user that the connection was refused (if needed, they can open a corporate page showing the most recent hostnames blocked from their machine and request authorization).
</p><p>Now, when clicking an unauthorized link (403 by Squid proxy) in FF, nothing happens. The GUI simply stales as nothing happened. 
To reproduce:
1. Configure FF with an HTTP proxy (squid) in deny by default.
2. Open duckduckgo, search something, and click on any https link that has not been whitelisted in the proxy.
3. After the click, nothing happens -&gt; no error, no information message, nothing.
(in the dev tools -&gt; network tab, one can see a 403 status.)
</p><p>This also happens when browsing websites: if the website includes a link to another website that is not whitelisted, nothing happens, the user is not informed that the host could not be reached.
</p><p>This seems like a mechanism has been broken, as FF always used to inform the user of the host not responding with an error page.

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall.
</p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen.
</p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout.
</p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly.
</p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second.

- client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a>

</p><p>When OneTouch is activated, the text 'Securely logging you in...' appears overlayed with the spinning wheel in the popup window. This continues indefinitely.
</p><p>When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next.
</p><p>It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour.
</p><p><br>
Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors.
</p><p>In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute ‘postMessage’ on ‘DOMWindow’: The target origin provided (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’) does not match the recipient window’s origin (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’).' error.
</p><p><br>
I believe this could be a recent issue because I was able to make several payments last month with all settings the same.
I have a separate user.js file that I keep my settings in (I can send it over if required). These settings have not been changed since the file has been created.
</p><p><br>
The following actions have been tried and didn't improve the situation:
</p><p>- refreshing the current profile
</p><p>- disabling all addins
</p><p>- adding <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> into exclusions for 'Block pop-up windows' and Enhanced Tracking Protection
</p><p>- cleaning History and cookies
</p><p><br>
I then launched Firefox with a separate 'clean' profile and was able to make the payment successfully. Sure enough, importing my user.js file broke PayPal. I went through the settings commenting them out by groups.
</p><p>The following setting was causing the issue:
</p><p>user_pref(""privacy.firstparty.isolate"", true);
</p><p>Setting it to 'false' made the PayPal popup window work correctly again.
</p><p>Thought that this would be helpful for anyone experiencing similar issues. Cheers.

I toggle between two pages.  The ""View Page"" and the ""Edit Page"".  But whenever I am on the ""View Page"" inside of the Pinned Tab and click on a page link that would change it to the ""Edit Page"", it opens the ""Edit Page"" in a new tab instead of the current one.
</p><p>I am aware that there is a browser.link.open_newwindow (default is 3, where 1 is the current tab, 2 is new window, and 3 is new tab) and a browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction (default is 2, where 0 is all, 1 is none, and 2 is only special windows) setting on the about:config page.
</p><p>It was suggested to change browser.link.open_newwindow to 1 (current tab) and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0 (all).
</p><p>When I do this, it does make the ""Edit Page"" link open up in the same Pinned Tab as the ""View Page"" that I am already on.  But it also causes all of the links in all the other tabs (not Pinned) to also open up in the same tab instead of a new one.  I know that holding down keys like CTRL might help with that, but I also have programs that open up pages when clicked on (you can't hold down CTRL when clicking on the system tray icon).  For example, Howard E-Mail Notifier will open up my Yahoo Mail in the same tab with these settings instead of a new tab.
</p><p>I REALLY don't want to hold down CTRL for links or go through any other hassle or BS.  I just want to see if there is a settings or a way to make it so that links in normal tabs (not Pinned) open up in new tabs, and links in Pinned Tabs open up in the same Pinned tab.  If it isn't possible, fine.  But I thought that I would ask.  Thanks.

The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).
It's frankly getting ridiculous and extremely annoying by that point. Is there a way to stop FF from screwing my ""about:config"" settings without my consent?

If you want to open links in Gmail (with a normal, left click) in a new window, you type about:config in the search bar, accept, then search browser.link.open_newwindow and set the value to 2. This will open clicked Gmail links in new window.

Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks.
Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc.
</p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section.
</p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites.
Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks.
This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find.
It may also be a government imposed function. Either one.
</p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ?
</p><p>WTF ?
I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ?
What the hell are you talking about ?
YOu care about my privacy ? STOP websites from reading my bookmarks !!!!!!!!!!!
Websites should have NO access to ANYTHING. They should not know what browser i have, they should not know what bookmarks i have.

</p><p>My Firefox browser (72.0, 64-bit, Win8.1) became slower at loading pages with the previous update, and I've noticed that it's caused by the same problem on each page to varying degrees. I'll click on a page to load it, then the black 'finding' dot on the tab will bobble about a bit, then it turns to the blue 'connecting' dot and keeps loading for minutes. At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up '<a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a>' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following:

Probe reinstalar y esto funciona. Pero cuando sincronizo mi cuenta, vuelve el problema.

I recently installed the kde plasma desktop as an option so I could log off and then log in to a user I created specifically to use the KDE Plasma desktop and applications. While in Ubuntu using Gnome as the default desktop all other browsers, Chrome, Brave, Opera etc use Nautilus to open the containing folder as they should since Nautilus is the default inode/directory setting and the default file manager for Gnome. Firefox however for reasons only known to God and hopefully you guys, has chosen to use Dolphin instead of Nautilus. I always have the option of just using a different browser as my default which I may wind up doing if you can't or won't fix your issue but I am hoping it is something simple I can do on my end. Any suggestions?

</p><p>Symptom: One day, out of nowhere and not pursuant to any user-initiated Firefox installation, configuration or plugin change, a deterministic set of websites begins to crash tabs immediately on page load.  Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash.  If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in.  Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart.  Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem.
</p><p>I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time.  This happened three times in the last six months.  As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on.
</p><p>Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop:

</p><p>No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation.  On a Linux box?  Seriously?  Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting).
</p><p>By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime.  Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached.
</p><p>I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms.  Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray?  No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday.  That seems unlikely since the crash has happened very frequently since yesterday on a variety of websites:
</p><p>$ sudo zgrep libxul /var/log/kern.log | wc -l
</p><p>32
</p><p>There is a prior bug report describing a similar experience here: <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100</a>
For what it's worth, a coworker on another team at my company also ran into these symptoms and mitigated it on his corporate laptop simply by reinstalling.
</p><p>Is there a way to mine the automated crash reporter data to see if this is an emerging trend of some kind?

</p><p>I'm sorry this is probably going to be a long explanation but want all to have the full picture.
</p><p>Over the years I would always back up my bookmarks as an html file whenever I reinstalled windows, got a new pc etc. One thing it seems I have missed and may be an issue is over the years I never made a firefox account. Just used the browser.
</p><p>Recently like many I'm sure, I updated a windows 7 laptop to windows 10. 
</p><p>This one time, I forgot to back up the bookmarks as an html file, just the rest of my files on the pc. This might of been because of all the chaos at the holidays or because I had already learned that the new windows 10 install can save everything from windows 7.
</p><p>I installed the windows 10 and selected the option to save all files and programs. When the install finished, there it was, what seemed to be my exact windows 7 laptop, files, and programs just with the windows 10 system now. FANTASTIC! All good!
</p><p>Not good. A few days later the laptop would not boot up. It was frozen at the windows 10 logo part of the start up with the spinning and spinning but never opened.
</p><p>Searched online for answers, found some, and tried all fixes. The laptop would also not start the auto repair feature.
</p><p>At this point I had to take it somewhere. I have an online business and of course it was all in that laptop... and backed up from a few weeks earlier.
</p><p>The place I would have taken it was closed for the week. took somewhere else.
</p><p>I told them I needed two things only since the pc was backed up a couple weeks back. 
</p><p>The files on the desktop and my FIREFOX BOOKMARKS! Easy right?
</p><p>They tried I'm sure the same methods I tried to get it to boot. They could not and said they would have to reinstall windows.
</p><p>Fine, no problem, they were told clearly what to save and windows 10 can save it anyway during the install.
</p><p>These idiots did not use the save all the files and programs option. They backed up files to their computers and wiped the laptop clean! Now what?
</p><p>Well we know the installation makes a windows old file and we all know firefox saves bookmark back ups, saves around 15 or so but you'll always have the most recent.
</p><p>This is the problem. Firefox didn't seem to saving the bookmarks or updating the backups.
</p><p>In my brand new laptop I can see in the backup bookmarks folder that it is backing up everyday or so and in just under a week I already have several days of backup bookmarks in the folder.
</p><p>On the old laptop, with the reinstall, the bookmark back up folder in the windows old folder has a list of backup json files but the last json file has a date created of September 2019 and then in the file name it seems to show a date of 12-22-19 which I thought was the bookmarks I needed seeing the December date in the file name. But it's not and they are what seems to be back from September. So why no back up json file for the last three months. I know that seems to be a short amount of time but first, the bookmarks seem to be older than september based on things I was doing at the time and in the last three months I have made major changes in my business and started a new one. EVERYTHING IS MISSING&gt; 
</p><p>Hope I can find some help. I read an article about everything possibly being in sqlite file or something.
</p><p>Thanks in advance.

<p>I have zero issues on Firefox 70.0.1. It's updating that's the problem and I know how to save my previous version to prevent full loss of my profile. I can't even go to safe mode or anything it immediately crashes on startup. When updating to ver 71 I only got 2 plugins which are adblock and a dark mode switch. As mentioned previous even deleting all folders including in the AppData and doing a clean install does not resolve this.

Lo que más echo de menos es poder reabrir pestañas cerradas por error fácilmente pulsando Control Mayúscula T, ya que suelo cerrarlas sin querer.
Buscando una solución en opciones, ayuda, en plugings y por internet he visto que el atajo de teclado es el mismo, pero en mi caso por más que lo pulso no se activa. ¿Podríais indicarme cómo activarlo -en caso de que sea así- en mis opciones, por favor? Me resulta realmente complicado trabajar sin eso. En caso de que no sea así, ¿Existe alguna otra forma sencilla de poder reabrir pestañas cerradas?

</p><p>Once installed, however, I entered a search term in the URL bar, and I discovered that instead of Google being my default search engine, my search engine was now Yahoo, and I realized that I got duped by malware.

I am taking advantage since a significant number of years of the HUGE history on Firefox-type (I also use Palemoon) browsers, to use these histories AS STUDY NOTEBOOKS. That is: I _always_ open a normal window, a Library&gt;History window, and a private window (_in this order_) and browse _only_ in (the) private window(s). And move (drag &amp; drop) studied pages carefully chosen URLs (page location tags, etc.) to the normal window (and therefore into the History), with the DATE AND TIME). (I know there is an addon for this but sometimes I know I want to save a whole sequence of page so this suits me better). This _time indexing_ and _chronological display_ of visited pages is an _invaluable_ asset in LEARNING (item linked to those visited before and after, work session span, etc.). I use the tags for notes / page extracts (the limited tag length is great because it forces to be concise).
I continuously curate this history and delete LOADS of things that I decide are no longer valuable, but I still have several years worth of notes. So I search and find a page, and its date is more that 6 months in the past. Now (as explained above) I have to navigate to that time to see THE CONTEXT of THAT _learning experience_. But I have so many items in the ""Older than 6 months"" 'folder' that scrolling to the right date _is awfull_ (imprecise, skip over the right date constantly , etc._ : - ( 
Please tell me there is a setting to display all 12 months in the History navigation pane, or an add-on that does that or the full indexing of the History (full years and months hierarchy). If not, please someone do it ! THIS (_empowering_ people to LEARN/ STUDY) WILL change the internet  / world.

I am getting sick and tired of websites taking action upon a Right Click Even. No, I am not talking about a webserver hijacking the righ-click menu. I have that under control. The problem is that the millisecond something is right-clicked on, the server executes and action, e.g. opening a different page.

</p><p>These overlapping areas use various fonts that provide glyphs for characters inside the Unicode Private Use Areas. Examples are:
</p>
<ul><li> All the things aggregated into NerdFonts - <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts</a>
</li><li> The Powerline shell-prompt symbols - <a href=""https://github.com/powerline/powerline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/powerline/powerline</a>
</li><li> Klingon - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html</a>
</li><li> Anything else in the ConScript Registry - <a href=""https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>So, I'd like to set up my browser to be able to display a few, or all of these things. For example, in the discussion going on at the GitHub issue <a href=""https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409</a>.
</p><p>But I don't see any way in Firefox to set up a chain of ""fallback fonts"" or something like that. In Preferences &gt; Language and Appearance &gt; Fonts and Colors &gt; Advanced, it gives me a selection for ""Fonts for:"", which allows me to assign fonts on a per-script basis. But:
</p><p>a) assigning a single font for ""Other Writing Systems"" (assuming that encompasses the Unicode PUA areas) is not sufficient, and
b) uh-oh, maybe bug! When I select ""Other Writing Systems"" and choose a new font for it (like the Klingon font ""plqaD""), it changes the main ""Default font"" for me back in the main preferences screen! That doesn't seem right?
</p><p>Thing is, there are a lot of these ""long tail"" little special-purpose fonts, that it would be nice to aggregate into a single viewing context. It would be nice if Firefox supported defining an arbitrarily-long list of ""fallback"" fonts to use in the case where a web page uses a character which is not assigned a glyph in any of the normal fonts.

But because my initial window isn't full-screen (it's about half the screen high), the new window opens in a different position than the initial one (it goes to the top of the screen). I don't like this; I'd like the new window to sit exactly on top of the initial one, same size and position.
</p><p>I would like to know either 1) how to configure FF to do this, if possible, or 2) use Javascript to make the new window behave the way I want. Let me take care here to explain that this is for my own personal private use only. I HATE it when web sites open new windows on me (unless it's a useful kind of modal window for displaying or inputting information), so I would never ever inflict this on anyone else! I simply want to open a new window on my own desktop when I fire up my browser.
</p><p>I should explain that I tried using window.open(), which doesn't work because FF blocks the new popup window. I'd rather not have to use some kind of work-around to defeat FF's popup-blocking behavior, if possible.
</p><p>Any help here will be appreciated.

This assumes the oligarch password had been entered correctly when prompted sometime after starting the browser.
</p><p>With the Quantum/Lockwise changes, there are multiple, repeating prompts for the oligarch password during the process of accessing the saved login data. Is this a bug, or is there a way to reduce the repeated requests? Because the oligarch password is so important, mine is long and complex. Having to type it in multiple times in the space of a minute or two seems unnecessary and annoying.
</p><p>When accessing Saved Logins, it asks for the Master Password. That's OK and consistent with prior Firefox behavior. But then when I find a login and want to look at it it asks the Master Password again. If I then want to copy it, it asks again. If I look at several different logins, each login, and each action on each login, requires entering the oligarch password over and over. That is a bit much, IHMO. 
</p><p>Once the user has reached the Saved Logins (Lockwise), they should be considered authenticated for the duration working with Lockwise. Further password prompts should not be needed. If Lockwise is closed, then it would be appropriate to re-authenticate.  The page could time-out and auto-close if left unattended for an extended period of time. 
</p><p>Are there any settings to reduce the usability challenges of the current behavior?

Sometimes its videos that no longer play. This time it was images. This time it started with spotify logging me out automatically after I logged in. It did not lag, it was not slow it was running smoothly. It just started to log me out like in 10 sec after login. I switched to Edge and it didnt log me out there. The bug was also in private browsing. Few minutes later I discovered that Aliexpress stopped showing me new images - it would load me images that I had already visited but for new images it would just show me empty box and image alt text. This also broke in both normal mode and private browsing mode. In Edge this also worked so I understood it was firefox problem, not my network problem. 
</p><p>To solve the issue I tried to clear recent history for time range everything and checked cache and offline website data. It did not help. Then I also tried to use forget about this site from history and Ctrl + F5 to make it force reload data. It did not help either. I also tried garbage collection and cycle collection because I thought that something was wrong in the memory.
</p><p>After these operations I tried to manually visit image location which I grabbed using inspect element. It turned out that firefox indeed downloaded the image but it turned out it did not completely download it. It downloaded 8.22kb data instead of 12kb and image viewers were not able to open it while visiting the same url with Edge gave me correct image which means that it wasnt faulty resource on server side.
</p><p>When it previously happened to me videos stopped to play both in private and normal browsing. It also does not seem to be dependent on FF version. This time it happened with FF 70.0. It was not running out of disk space - had still over hundred GB left nor RAM (it only used 25G out of 64G). I use Windows 10 x64.
</p><p>I know I could have solved this issue with browser restart (which I did by now) but but since I usually have a lot of stuff going on and just restoring tabs isn't enough for me because reloading tab from internet does not restore it exactly as it was before since all the JS progress will be lost but sometimes some tabs I need exactly as they were which is why I would not like to restart firefox very often.
</p><p>I would like to know what causes such issues and if there is any other way than browser restart to fix it? Like manually deleting something from somewhere?

I had what I thought was the correct sessionstore.jsonlz4 file for the old session, judging by the file size, but apparently the new session was written into that file, and the old session moved to a section with key ""lastSessionState"".  I could not find any information on opening that ""last session"", so resorted to uncompressing and editing the sessionstore file.  I removed the initial section for the new session, and removed the ""lastSessionState"" key.  The remainder of the file seemed to have the same structure as the initial session section.  Not having an easy way to re-compress the file, I copied it into the profile as sessionstore.js, as, once upon a time, folks said that sessionstore.js would be read if sessionstore.jsonlz4 was not present.  I hid all the files in sessionstore-backups.  However, when I started Firefox, it did not find the old session.  So...
</p><p>Hoping someone knows:  Is there a way to get Firefox to switch to the ""lastSessionState"" session?  Or, do I need to compress the fixed up sessionstore.js in order to get Firefox to recognize it?  Thanks!

And I used to have the same restrictive Firefox settings on my old laptop with Windows 7, and Dashlane would auto-log me in.  What do I need to do to get Dashlane to remember my credentials when I start up Firefox?

It's gotten maddening to be perfectly honest as there doesn't appear to be any solution to the problem and I've honestly reached the point after this feature being so unstable for so long that I don't understand why the feature even exists since it's never worked reliably sine it's inception. What's going on with this? I used to be able to use tab locking addons that worked far better than this but now no one is able to make them due to the changes. Is this ever going to improve or should I just give up dreaming?

Now I have upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and am running FF 71 so I'd like to migrate back to FF.  Many of the bookmarks and passwords that are in Chrome are still in FF.  I know I can ""Import and Backup&gt;Import Data from Another Browser&gt;Chrome"" and pick everything to import and everything will be imported into a toolbar folder called ""From Google Chrome""  
</p><p>Please note:  everything I need is in Chrome at this time. I don't need anything that is currently in FF.
</p><p>I'm trying to decide the best way to proceed.  Backup the json and sqlite FF files and then delete those files or just delete the bookmarks before importing.  I am concerned with saved passwords since many have changed since I have been on Chrome.  
</p><p>I could create  a new profile and import there. 
</p><p>Anyway, I would appreciate any suggestions here on the best way to handle the migration.  Thanks!

</p><p>Alright, there was maybe some trouble-shooting I skipped over however this had its reasoning.  However onto the problem.  I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser.  My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ).  The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load.  In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space.
</p><p>I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked.  I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter.  So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe.  However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on.  When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine.
</p><p>Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head.  I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default.  I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem.  Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem.
</p><p>Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet.  Here's hoping I catch some good advice.  :3

Recently the above mentioned line showed up in both the install.ini and profiles.ini files.
This is what is in the files now:
Profiles.ini
</p><pre>   [Install308046B0AF4A39CB]
   Default=Profiles/5cmttesr.default
   Locked=1
</pre>
<pre>   [Profile0]

</pre>
<p>Install.ini
</p><pre>   [308046B0AF4A39CB]
   Default=Profiles/5cmttesr.default
   Locked=1
</pre>
<p>As can be seen under the default profile listing is the locked=1 line or setting.
So does this lock the profile so no changes can be made, or only lock some parts or does the 1 indicate it is unlocked or what?
All the profile.ini articles and examples do not show the locked= line at all or even mention it as an optional setting.

Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit) does not always use GDI rendering,"<p>Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit) is the only version that allows switching to GDI rendering with hacks. The hacks involve setting gfx.canvas.azure.backends and gfx.content.azure.backends to just cairo.
</p><p>Aside from Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8 and Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003, the only browser I can think of where it's possible to use GDI rendering is Firefox ESR 52.4.1 (32-bit).

</p><p>The problem with DirectWrite is that the text is rendered with way too many dark gray pixels, causing text to become unrealistically thicker and more distorted. On the other hand, GDI uses correct gamma and fully respects font hinting, meaning text renders exactly as the type designer intended.

The solution is to fix the Windows Registry entry for the jpeg MIME type to use either .jpeg or .jpg instead of .jfif.
</p><p>However, because it can only be changed to either .jpeg or .jpg, the Firefox file upload dialog only shows the one it's changed to.

Currently using a gtx 1070ti, and Nvidia had no insight on the issue after much runabout with their live chat support, and I've since isolated that it only occurs with firefox and hardware acceleration within it enabled. On occasion I see elements on webpages vanish or go blank until you mouse or click a bit, images tessellate or show up very large for a second, and I've seen it cause entire screen-wide flickers of horizontal white lines for a very brief moment. 
</p><p>I'm curious if this issue is known or how I can make it known. I was worried it was a hardware issue at first, or that it was drivers, but after complete fresh installations and removals with ddu, nothing else having issues for 2 years, and isolating the problem to only occur with firefox open and hardware acceleration enabled and other issues unique to inside the browser, I think it's more likely something on Mozilla's end. At this point I think there's nothing left for me to do on my end, but maybe somebody has some more insight.

However in Firefox, when I go to print a crossword puzzle from the wall street journal it prints the puzzle in the upper left quadrant, about half size.  Doing the same thing with another site, everything is fine, and if I use a different browser, it is fine.  Also, depending upon the site, I get a different print set up page, and it appears that the problem lies only on one of these setup pages.  I have tried changing just about every setting to no avail.
.1. Is there a way to change which print set up page appears for different sites?  2.  Is there a fix somewhere which will correct this problem?

I found one from a couple of days ago that mentions Firefox &amp; another one that mentions Software Protection &amp; lists a number of items with a long list of letters &amp; numbers that look like Firefox crash reports  
When I use Chrome, I dont have these problems. So I have made Chrome my default browser although I prefer Firefox if these problems can be fixed. Thank you. Jonathan Rose

removed Mozilla from AppData folder. No instances of Firefox popped up in task manager and resource monitor during process just to make sure.
</p><p>- Same thing as above except in safe mode.
</p><p>- Tried to open Firefox using run command ""firefox /safe"" but no dice.
</p><p>- Did a system restore.
</p><p>- Uninstalled previous Windows 10 update.
</p><p>At this point I have no clue what's causing the problem as all other browsers work fine and next option might be to reset Windows 10 but I'd prefer to not do that if possible.

My first stop was the ""customize..."" option in the Firefox menu. Why can't I ""customize..."" Firefox so that the address bar, and navigation buttons are hidden?. And why is there no way to disable+hide the use of tabs in ""Preferences""?. I spent the better part of two weeks searching the Internet (and Firefox add-ons) trying to find a way to achieve this chromeless experience. I remembered that there is JavaScript that will automatically open a webpage's popup window(s) in a chromeless mode. I found examples online and decided to create a local "".html"" file on my Linux Mint 19.2 (XFCE) system, add the code, then have Firefox open this local page (file:/home/user/Documents/index.html) instead of a online homepage. I disabled the ""Block pop-up windows"" option, and added the local ""index.html"" file to the exceptions. It didn't work. I checked the ""about:config"" settings in Firefox and found JavaScript to already be enabled. I used all the examples I found online, but none of them seem to work.

</p><p>Another suggestion is the [Inspect Element] -&gt; [Network]: enable the user to copy all the URLs on the list, currently, I can only copy one at a time and is annoying, especially for those in the realm of combating malvertising and tech support scams.

Late last week Firefox and Opera could not connect from either Pu or Org while Chrome and Edge could.   
Removing Firefox and Opera from the list of allowed programs in Zone Alarm, cold booting and adding them to Zone Alarm did not work.

As a result Opera can connect to the internet from Ma but no longer can connect from Pu.
After uninstalling Adobe Flash Player Opera was able to connect from Ma.

</p><p>For example, Options - General - Files and Applications - Applications - Choose how Firefox handles the files you download from the web or the applications you use while browsing. Content Type: PDF, Action: [we change it to what we want, such as ""use Bluebeam"" or ""use Adobe"" or ""preview in Firefox"", and then it will re-set to something else, such as ""Save File"" (which saves the file to Downloads and does not open the file in a program)]
</p><p>And also Options - General - Firefox Updates - Keep Firefox up to date for the best performance, stability, and security. 
Allow Firefox to...
Automatically install updates (recommended)
OR 
Check for updates but let you choose to install them
[in older versions of the browser, there was also a third option for NOT automatically checking for updates at all. But newer versions of Firefox do not seem to offer this.]
Whichever of the first two options we choose, we have had cases where Firefox does not preserve the selection and switches the user to the other selection.
</p><p>When the selections get re-set to something other than what the user chose, it likely happens due to a Firefox software update. 
</p><p>I have been told by an IT consultant that the way to preserve the selections is to use Firefox Sync and under ""choose what to sync,"" make sure the ""Options"" box is ticked. But we have done that, and users with Sync turned on still find that not all of their Options selections are preserved.

So I lost my Firefox 52 install with all of my extensions (that still worked).  Now, I'm running v. 57 Quantum, and a few things aren't working correctly.
</p><p>First, the MAJOR problem:  when I open a link from a bookmark, it's clobbering an existing tab that I was using (that's why it was open, obviously).  That is completely unsat and can not be allowed to continue.  How do I correct this?  I can't find the option under settings--&gt;tabs to fix this problem.
</p><p>Second issue (major annoyance):  I can no longer create a bookmark directly in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar.  I used to be able to open that bookmark folder, and the first option was to bookmark the currently open tab.  That option has vanished, and i use that all the time.  How do I restore that?
</p><p>Actually, one more issue:  I have two tabs that are pinned and are supposed to be protected (i.e., nothing can clobber them, and I can't close them without deliberately turning the protection off (context menu right-clicking on tab).  I need that back, because for some reason, firefox thinks it's ok to open a bookmark in those tabs, too, when it most definitely is NOT ok.

When I play audio or watch youtube on Firefox, the sound plays directly on my computer's speakers. It's as if no headphones were connected at all.
</p><p>I opened up the volume mixer and included screenshots below. On the left, when I'm not connected to the headphones, the sound plays via the speakers and you can clearly see mozilla's audio levels in green are ok. When I connect the headphones (middle photo) the sound still plays via the speakers but there are two firefoxes and one is playing audio, the other is not. I don't know why there are two, I only have one tab open. Lastly, when I switch the audio device to headphones, Firefox completely disappears from the list of applications playing audio. I opened up other browsers and played audio in each and they are listed in the applications, as you can see in the last photo. They are actively playing audio as indicated by the green audio levels and I can hear them via the headphones. Firefox on the other hand, is still playing via my computer's speakers.

Unfortunately, the certificate has expired and the site is using HSTS.

Neither of these options are preferable. Is it possible to bypass HSTS for this site or will firefox force me to wait for the site admins to fix it (doubtful because the certificate expired in early October)? Is there a command line flag, or a patch to the source code that will permit this?

</p><p>Then I have a Windows10 gaming laptop and Flash sometimes struggle there.
</p><p>All computers have Chrome and play flash equally ""okay"".

I removed the plugins from the directory manually then started again. I downloaded the NPAPI version from adobe (pictured). I then extracted the files and copied the plugin (<a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>) to firefox's plugin path ($MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH, which for me was /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins). I then restarted firefox. However, the shockwave flash plugin is not present in the plugins tab. This is odd as it was a couple of days ago before I redid this. Sites like newgrounds worked perfectly. Back when flash was working, I noticed on some sites that used html5, it would instead try to use flash. For a whille, the openh264 was stuck on ""will be installed shortly."" Now when I go to those sites, it will show the thumbnail, but not play. Youtube videos still work, however. In fact, it's really the only video site that still works. Was there a dramatic change in the past couple of days or something?

1) places.sqlite has become places.sqllite.corrupt and is replaced by a fresh places.sqlite- the former corrupt file cannot be replaced/renamed as places.sqlite anymore
2) favicons.sqlite becomes favicons.sqlite.corrupt
3) all addons are marked as disabled. Reenabling them by editing extensions.json (changing all instances of appDisabled”: true to “appDisabled”: false) does not make the plugins enabled again

1) without turning internet off when running up firefox 51: corrupts the latest firefox install - requires redownloading and setting up
2) turn internet off, load up firefox 51, tell it to never update. Then continue closing and loading up current firefox - profile is corrupted as above
3) first Visit about:profiles in latest firefox, set the default profile to a new profile ""switchToMeBeforeLoadingOldFirefox"". Close browser and reopen, note a default blank profile. Close new firefox. Open old firefox without internet at above - frustratingly just doing this with my 'real' profile open in the mac's finder, I can see the sqlite temprary files being created in my 'real' profile when firefox 51 is open, corrupting it all as above.

The behaviors started some time in the last six months or so.  I just noticed them in the last week when I updated the website.  The website is <a href=""https://281connections.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/</a>  and I am using using Firefox 71.0 on Ubuntu Mate 19.04  . . .
Question 1
When accessing the hosted site, the script that toggles the menu to drop down is ignored (<a href=""https://281connections.us/#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/#</a> ).  (Using a Chromium browser, I can get the script to run by telling it to “load unsafe scripts”.)  The script in question is run in Firefox without objection when the same code/site is invoked from files local to my machine.  I can not find a setting in Firefox to allow the script to execute when invoked from hosted source.  I have tried an assortment of settings changes, but can’t find anything that works.  Can you help?
Question 2
Javascript that runs a dynamic page (<a href=""https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://281connections.us/281connections_Wiki/South_Dakota_Families/Bates-Moodie/Fan/DynamicFan.html</a> ) runs just fine using Firefox and the hosted website.  However, when invoked on local files, it does not run.  (It presents a large circle, but never fills it with information.)  Is there a setting that will allow me to see dynamic page when invoked locally?  (BTW, the behavior is identical using Chromium for what that is worth.)
</p><p>Last note - disabling extensions does not affect the behaviors noted.

</p><p>I have an Office 365 personal account. When attempting to use FF to log in to One Drive directly -- meaning, I go straight to the One Drive login page via bookmark, and do not attempt to enter One Drive via a ""side door"" such as a link on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> -- I encounter significant latency and, often, outright non-responsiveness. Last Pass will not autofill the login credentials; nor can I type them in directly with anything other than crippling latency, if at all. Same latency with password and 2-factor entry. If I am able to survive log-in, One Drive presents significant lag to clicks, often accompanied by fleeting clues in the lower-left corner of the screen, usually involving cryptography such as ""waiting for cdn-15 <a href=""http://office.net"" rel=""nofollow"">office.net</a> . . . "" or something similar. Often the word ""Excel"" or ""Word"" will be displayed in one of those messages, but they are so fleeting (and appear to be truncated for display) that I can't capture them completely.
</p><p>Switching off extensions appears to have no effect. The lag and general unresponsiveness continues.
</p><p>Interestingly, when I instead log in directly to Outlook (and not One Drive), and then move into One Drive via a One Drive link that is presented in the Outlook waffle button, then One Drive appears to behave promptly and normally. No lag issues that I can determine. (Also, with all FF extensions=true, login and use of Outlook is satisfactory. No problems that I can see).
</p><p>The Windows One Drive app, which runs on the local system, also appears to function normally. I can see/modify files in my One Drive via the local app. That's groovy, but sometimes you need to see the file system in the web browser.
</p><p>So I guess that's the workaround: Get access to One Drive by going *through* Outlook. Okay, but why? What's going on? How to fix?

</p><p>Periodically, at unpredictable intervals, Firefox reverts my choice of spellcheck dictionary (English US) to English Australian. In the FF Preferences i don't even have Australian as an option: i have only UK, US, and Canada. Nonetheless, now and then, FF will start marking the word ""color"" as misspelled, at which point i know that the dictionary has once again been swapped out. Right-clicking the misspelled word and selecting ""Languages..."" reveals that Australian is always, without exception, the one it's been switched to.
</p><p>My system-wide language is US English. Nothing, on any of my systems, is configured to use Australian, so FF making this particular choice of dictionaries completely befuddles me.
</p><p>The ""troubleshooting information"" which was automatically attached to this post confirms that i don't have Australian English activated in FF.

In my bookmarks library I have a lot of folders organized in a tree with multiple branches themselves organized in hierarchic levels.
Sometimes I don't find the bookmark I want to use by browsing my tree, probably because I didn't put it in the right location in the tree.
I can find it by the ""Search bookmarks"" function but this function doesn't provide the bookmark location in the tree (and I don't see any other way to locate it). Thus I can't correct the bookmark location error in the tree.

</p><p>Thanks to Mozilla for continuing to develop such a clean browser, with movies made of GIF instead of much larger files.
</p><p>So we have developed an extension or add-on for many years using the same method. But recently ( maybe I forgot ), with a new developer profile, I am unable to edit any files because the .xpi extension in the extensions folder, is compressed and cannot be navigated in a file Explorer.
</p><p>In the past, I just install the extension and change the file extension from .xpi to .zip, and then extract into a folder with the same name. Then delete the .xpi/.zip folder, and the new folder acts as a pointer for the same instance of installation. And I can just modify the files in that folder usually and I don't need to restart the browser to see the changes. But lately I cannot do this.
</p><p>What is the best way to debug the add-on with the least number of steps?
</p><p>Thanks,
</p><p>Josh

I understand how difficult Sync is and have read the deep dive article on how it is being (or has been) rebuilt to work ""properly"".
I have just one question - but here's why: Sync still has the ability to mess up bookmarks between my 5 Windows machines. 
So all I want is a clear way to do this: 
I'd like to fix up all my bookmarks on one machine : let's call it ""A"" - and then propagate that to all the others. 
I tried doing this by 
A. Stopping sync on all, 
B. Fixing up the duplicates, empty folders and other messed up things in bookmarks on A manually
C. Starting Sync again. 
And within a day my 5 hour marathon had been completely wasted as they were in a heck of a mess again. 
Could someone please try and include ""A straightforward way to reset and rebuild your bookmarks- AND SYNC THEM!"" in the design doc?
And put that a set of clear instructions somewhere?
But in the meantime - please let me know how I do this. Surely ""reset  and rebuild from here"" is an obvious requirement?
Thanks guys - this hurts because I'm completely in love with the ""new"" Firefox and how safe I feel with it. So help me here!

</p><p>In both instances, after logging in, it doesn't give me any indication of being finished - instead it prompts me to ""install on another device"". Most recently, on this computer, it asked me to send an SMS to my phone to login to Firefox Sync on my phone.
</p><p>This would be reasonable, except for the fact that I'm already using Firefox on my phone, and have it actively logged in with the account I'm logging in to. When I go to look at my devices on <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>, I have 6 devices listed, including my phone ""last seen 7 hours ago"" and my main computer ""last seen 3 hours ago"". It's clear to me that these are active devices, and that I don't need to install on any other devices to get sync working.
</p><p>The main reason this is annoying is that I don't get any confirmation that I've completed logging in - only a prompt to do something unnecessary. I can work around this by simply ignoring the prompt, but I'm concerned for other less tech-savvy consumers who might be confused, thinking they're still not done when they login to Sync on their second device! Imagine someone logs into their phone first, and then the computer - it'd be pretty confusing to then have the computer ask them to sign in on the phone.
</p><p>I personally was slightly confused, and had to double check that bookmarks were actually syncing and that I hadn't accidentally made a new account or done something to erase my previously logged-in devices...

I used the places.sqlite from that but I was still getting an empty history and it was also not recording any more new history. I also tried pasting the entire backup profile folder onto the main profile folder. And I tried creating a new profile and transferring my places.sqlite there but I get the same result. However my bookmarks are still there. 
</p><p>Is there no way to get my history back? I'm guessing it is a corrupted places.sqlite. Is it possible to repair the places.sqlite? Sadly I don't have any knowledge on how to use SQlite shell to repair it myself. It would be nice if someone could do that for me! Strangely, the places.sqlite file size is 10240kb, which seems a bit too small for my entire history. 
</p><p>I'm terrible at explaining things so I apologize if it was hard to follow. I'm distraught about this and pretty desperate to get my history back. I'd appreciate any help.

</p><p>I will upload screencaps if needed, but I am going to a banking website, entering UID &amp; password, and telling FF to update the password.  Not only does it not update for that UID, instead putting it into the ""no username"" storage for this website, but it is storing asterisks (in the same amount as the actual password) instead of the password.  Yes, I clicked on the little ""eye"" next to the password field under Tools.Options.Privacy .. and yes, I tried trusting and just using the stored password both for the UID (it kept the old password) and also for the ""no username"" and neither works.  I can update the password manually when under Tools.Options.Privacy, but I do not have the time nor inclination to do this for hundreds of logins.

No doubt I will be told its my fault because I dont have update 72.3.56.786  or install 234.3987.2 or some crap no one would ever know about

However there's not means of archiving, syncing or backup for all your fastidious work configuring your various websites to open within specific containers. If your local Firefox profile is lost, so is your hard work with container setup. We need means of backing up our container setup, either via some export / import utility or using Firefox Sync. Either is fine as this extension is a more advanced feature, but totally awesome! Thanks.

Some are extremely simple to find but others seem impossible to locate. I even logged into the addons page thinking it would show my installed addons so I could locate them. Well no, it doesn't. Which doesn't make sense. Similarly lacking sense is an advanced search. There doesn't seem to be a way to search by title or author, just by a vague keyword. From what I'm seeing of results, it seems that it either picks one word out of many to search for or boils it down to some other vague term. Even if I type in the exact title it will bring up completely different results along with some that are similar to what I have installed. Author searches don't bring up anything. There has to be a way to locate specific add-ons right? The search seems completely useless as is except to browse. Similarly, why don't installed add-ons link to their page on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org?"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org?</a> So how do I find my addon? This is exactly the reason WHY I want to bookmark them so that I don't have a problem finding them in the future when there's more addons to sift through. Amazing that I can't find it while I have it installed. (The one I'm looking for is Dark YouTube Theme by NiCU Natrapeiu)
</p><p>I know I can just switch to any number of other similar add-ons but this one works and it infuriates me that I'd have to choose a different one just because the search function is terrible. Keep in mind it is already installed. I want to find the page for it at <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> so that I can reinstall it in the future should I need to do a fresh installation.

Of course Windows in it's infinite wisdom will not let you choose which monitor is number 1. This basically makes the feature useless. :(
So, is there some setting somewhere in the about:config where I can control which monitor is default? I can't find an obvious one, at least.
EDIT: I was wrong. It doesn't always open the video on the 1st monitor. It just always opens the video on the monitor to the left of the one the browser is on. :D

On Google Play you can review installed extensions in Play Store easily by click each of them and use the one-tap rating button.
On iOS, if you allow them, App Store will even prompt you a one-tap rater after you've installed some app and used for a while, which is even more convenient.

Now if FF crashes for some reason or there is a power outage, sometimes session restore only works for one profile that is restarted first, while the others lose all the tabs that were open last time. Now I have a feeling that this is much more likely to happen if the browser was recently updated (it happened several times on the first restart after the update).
I reckon that this might have something to do with the session restore only restoring one of the opened windows (which, as I understand, is now fixed).
In each of the profiles the automatic session restore is set on.

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected. 
</p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there.
</p>
<ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install. Stylus also doesn't work, and all my styles have vanished. Tampermonkey worked running a script on Youtube, but once again, on startup, the script was gone.

1274489,2019-12-06 13:54:52 -0800,2019-12-21T18:51:11Z,Can't Log In to SSA Website,"<p>About six months ago, I posted here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265504</a> b/c I was unable to log into the AT&amp;T website.  Seems others had the same issue but on various other wireless service sites and for various reasons - mine ended up being that either AT&amp;T or UBlock had made some changes and I was forced to turn off UBlock at least for the log-in page.   Later, I ended up having to kill both UBlock and AdBlock on another provider's website or the system would not recognize that I had scheduled a payment.
</p><p>Now I find that I cannot log into the Social Security Administration's website.  I started off by pausing AdBlock with no luck.  I then turned off UBlock - no help.  Turned both ad blockers OFF for the site - no luck.  I then went into Options and tweaked various settings, reloading tabs if that was required, otherwise I relaunched the browser before trying to log in to the SSA site again.
</p><p>When I first experienced an issue attempting to log in on the SSA on 20 November, I had FF vs 70.0.1.  Yesterday, FF started nagging me to upgrade to 71.0 - which I did so today before attempting again to get logged in to the SSA site.  I was hoping that would fix the problem....
</p><p>I do not visit the SSA website often, but I had never had any log-in issue until 20 November.  While on the phone with a SSA site support rep on 04 December, I expressed that I felt my blocking of tracking cookies and 3rd party cookies should not be the issue - the rep agreed.  And just FYI, the rep also agreed that my ad blockers should not have been an issue.  Reluctantly, I went to MS Edge - I was able to log in.   I am not well-versed in MS Edge's settings/options, but I do know that advanced settings/options are only available while signed in to a MS account.  I neither trust nor use Edge (or IE for that matter) and do not have a MS account, so I had no intention of creating one just to see how to lock down and make that browser more secure - if that's possible.
</p><p>I have checked the post ""Fix login issues on websites that require a username and password.""
	*Options&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Cookies and Site Data&gt;Manage Permissions&gt;<a href=""https://secure.ssa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ssa.gov</a> -  ALLOW
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear history each time the browser is closed, so as I expected, I found nothing in Library&gt;History&gt;Show All History, and so could clear nothing
	*FF is (and always has been) set to clear cookies and cache each time the browser is closed, but I followed the Library&gt;History&gt;Clear Recent History&gt;Time Range:Everything and hit the ""Clear Now"" button anyway
	*Add-ons and security settings tweaked as advised above, to include reducing ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" down to only 'Standard.'
	*I did not check for corrupt cookie files as I prefer to leave this as a last resort.  However, I do not use the 'saved log ins' feature or use a oligarch password - I get the impression that is what would be affected if I followed the provisions outlined, and so may not apply to my issue.  Right?
</p><p>All that said... does anyone have any idea why I cannot log in to the SSA site using FF?

</p><p>In a related migration/replace problem, I cannot sync my new computer with the old, even though they're both in the same account name.  The jalopy and new computer names are both recognized in the jalopy, but the new computer doesn't pick up the old computer name.   This was the first thing I tried to reconcile the two machines.  I am extremely frustrated, and at my wits end dealing with this problem.  Any reasonable assistance and solutions are appreciated.  Thank you.

This is done with the Task Manager.
However the last month every 10 to 20 minutes the priority settings are reversed and about four firefox.exe processes are then set to Low priority at regular time intervals. This also seems to result in slow response to mouseclicks.
Are you aware of this phenomenon? Is this something Firefox does by itself, or is this intervention coming from Windows 10.
I notice that when I put explorer.exe in high priority, this lasts till shutdown of the computer, as with other manageble processes.

On the old computers, if I download a .aspx file from a website (something I do frequently for my job) the file would open in my installed pdf reader (Foxit PhantomPDF - Version:  9.2.0.9297). On the new computers, the .aspx file opens in the Firefox ""in-browser"" pdf reader. The filetype .pdf is set to automatically open in Foxit, but there is no .aspx filetype available in the applications list of Firefox preferences. Does anyone know a away to force firefox to open a certain filetype (like .aspx) with a certain program?
</p><p>For reference, my old computers were Lenovos. I had a tower running windows 7 and a laptop running windows 10. Both behaved correctly where the .aspx file would open automatically (or at least ask) in Foxit. The new computers are Dells. Again a tower and a laptop. Both are running windows 10 and both are behaving the same way where .aspx files open in the firefox ""in-browser"" pdf reader.

Even when I enable the ""offline mode"",  tabs with heavy javascript continue trying to load, consuming CPU resources. I want they to stop immideately. I tried different extensions, but results are unsatisfactory. Does anybody know some trick?
My goal is to find a method to flush all javascript structures in RAM. I explored about:memory, and tried the vmmap.exe (process memory analyzer) from the Sysinternals Suite, but I have not succeeded so far.
Auto unload tab -- is not a solution. For example I clicked on links and opened 30 tabs in background. PC starts working very slow, Now I want to stop all them, and to read the loaded information (webpages). How to do it? I think it is the weakest side of Firefox. Needed to abrupt all attempts to make network connection, after the ""offline mode"" is enabled.
I need something to stop javascript's attempts to connect, to calm it down. I want to start read webpages already loaded, and javascript occupies CPU. To kill threads in the Process Manager is not a way to do at all, Auto-unload also, I want to read those webpages.  I have enough of RAM, it is not used more then a half. 
Many years ago, when there was HTML4, I used for a little the Maxton browser. It had a button to stop all pages. All similiar Firefox extensions do not act effectively like that.
the issue not in scarcity of RAM, but in a badly design of browser's architecture, that javascript occupies users' PCs.

</p><p>I log out of devices that I do not own when I'm exiting Firefox. Today I opened Firefox on a device that I'm 100% certain I logged out of yesterday - and found that my bookmarks, bookmarks bar, and add-ons were already visible and active, and one of my add-ons was already logged in. 
</p><p>I verified that the Firefox Sync / login screen showed that no one was logged into the Firefox account, and then I logged in using my usual credentials. It reflected that I was then logged in, but everything else remained visible. 
</p><p>I followed Firefox instructions for viewing the logs, and strangely, there was no log. I went up a directory, and found that all the logs were in the 'failed' directory. Clicking on each of the failed subfolders shows only: ids	[]
</p><p>This is very concerning because it entirely negates the security and privacy aspects of having a login. I was not logged into Firefox - and the Firefox interface confirmed that this morning, in addition to confirming it when I logged out yesterday - yet somehow not only were my personal bookmarks showing, but one of my add-ons was also logged in, providing further access to anyone who might have opened a Firefox window from this device.

The other is AnonymoX which I use for general purposes.
</p><p>A few days ago I upgraded to Firefox 71.0 as well as updated my Windows 10 to the latest 1903 version. Today I noticed that both extensions have stopped working. AnonymoX just doesn't work, whereas the other plugin, upon activation, says (translated) ""Conflict detected! Proxy settings are controlled by a different plugin or cannot be set up"" Trying to circumvent a block (and only then - unblocked websites work fine) now either redirects me to the ISPs blocking page, or alternatively produces a ""Secure Connection Failed PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR""  message after a long TLS handshake. Running the same extensions in Chrome does not reproduce the issue - blocked websites become accessible as usual. The issue also persists for three different connections - a public wi-fi network, a private network and a tethered 4G connection, all served by different ISPs. Finally, I am not running any anti-virus software or firewall. Thus this seems to be a Firefox issue and not a system or network issue. 
</p><p>This also doesn't seem to be an issue with the country's blocking system itself because other users around me are still able to circumvent blocks using the same extensions and I am able to circumvent blocks using a similar extension on my Android phone with a local SIM. 
</p><p>Things I've tried so far:
1) Made sure that both Windows and Firefox are set to not use a proxy
</p><p>2) Reinstalled the extensions
</p><p>3) Created a different profile in Firefox. The extensions don't work in the new profile either, although the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR does not appear - I just always get redirected to the respective ISPs block page
</p><p>4) Cleared all cache, cookies, site settings etc.
</p><p>5) Deleted the cert9.db file and let Firefox recereate it
</p><p>So far nothing has worked. I'm frankly at a loss here. I have half a mind to just reinstall Firefox altogether since this is not my main PC and losing bookmarks wouldn't inconvenience me on it, but figured I'd ask here before.

1274301,2019-12-04 14:02:33 -0800,2019-12-06T17:38:45Z,What caused profiles to torque two days ago?,"<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask the question that comes at the end of this note.  If you scroll to the end, you can see it marked as MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
</p><p>As I was posting the question, I took advantage of the moment to reflect on the fact that FireFox's perseverance over its long history of ups and downs today has made FireFox one of the real hopes for humanity.  Long Live FireFox!
</p><p>Back in the dark ages, before the ascendance of Google's Chrome browser, I learned to recover FireFox's guts, to cope with its gastric spasms of projectile digital vomiting, which seemed to occur every few weeks.  Most software in those days contributed full shares to the unusable stew, made the accumulation of digital barf that needed cleanup as often as I needed to clean up after hangovers from over drinking when I was a stupid youth. Those were the days when running a computer all day without being forced to restart taught me to weild Windows Task Manager as weapon, which usually provided a side step around enough of the binary vomit top cut restarts from 4 a day to only one or two.
</p><p>Years later, while Microsoft was recovering from the largest, most expensive public mistake in software history (Windows 8), Google got a handle on Chrome.  After that, around 2014, Google either found Popeye's spinach factory, or aliens joined them in their Mountain View offices, because no human force can account for the rate and quality of significant upgrades to all their systems since then, for Chrome browser, underlying Chromium technology now used by everyone, not just for browsers, but all manor of application software to run on all kinds of platforms, Android for phones and apps, YouTube video processing that spots copyrighted sound and images in every video that has it, the world-leading advertising systems and dashboards, and their search engine so much better than anyone else's our choice is to use Google Search or be stupid and slow, or use Google Maps or be lost.  Google pumps out new and better software features one hundred times faster than any other organization.  If you missed the media reports explaining this, that is because Google's super productivity has not been celebrated in anything like the degree warranted. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, Google also has become so evil  it probably cannot be prevented from destroying the system of human checks and balances invented in the United States 240 years ago. As simple and feeble as those checks and balances are, without them it is hard to see how any substantial part of the human population ever could have experienced and lived with Liberty and the productivity it makes possible.  For example, without the Liberty growing throughout the world after taking its initial root in the United States and our written Constitution, one of the most ingenious and consequential documents ever written, the normal result of military conflict would have been one murderous, tyrannical, wholly self-serving dictatorship or another forcing 99% of the human population to live as serfs or politicians in the involuntary service of people like you know who.  Google and the rest of the power players in commercial media are destroying that, through political bias they lie about.  The problem with their lies is they have the power of their media platform to perpetrate them.  Google is evil and needs to be neutralized.  The main thing I can do about this is to stop using their products.  The other thing I can do is tell people about what is happening.  I was raised to see things this way, but for until recently, I did not see this is the way we have to look at things because this is the way that works.  Until recently, I did not know society cannot stop functioning, but now I know that the functioning we all take for granted, including the people fighting against it, is rare as diamonds when viewed in the context of human history, Some of the people attacking our country want to break it down, because they want the United States to become like the places people now leave in order to come here.  The sickness is the same that has affected all gluttons for power.  They have learned that force of military arms tends to galvanize people like you and me.  Instead, they lie to us. pretending to harbor the same loves for life you and I have, when in truth they see us is idiot patsies, making us deserve their the damages wrought by their treachery.
</p><p>Therefore, I stopped using Chrome, returning to the FireFox way of browsing.  I was with Chrome so long, I forgot all about recovering browser profiles.  FireFox is a lot more reliable today than it was before Chome blew everybody out of the water, but its profile system still ha regular bouts with projectile digital vomiting.
</p><p>Today, my FireFox is not blasting bile all over the house, but is being rather brave holding the contagion within itself. I noticed passwords not filling into web forms that used to be there. I am not sure of the timing.  I probably was a long time ago, but I kept getting messages from FireFox babbling about their new security system.
</p><p>Today, I needed to identify active profile (i.e., the one I use) from the half dozen profiles piled into my FireFox installation.  I don't know why there is more than one.  Unfortunately, I just could not glean the one I need to look at from their names:
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p>The online guide provided the usual waste of time.  I asked the computer how to know which profile is the active one.  I immediately found thousands of articles which each spell out the same eight or ten reasons why a person might wish to know which profile is active. The people writing these articles know their articles are filled mostly with spam (information we already have or don't need), but their editors are evaluated on word count, needed for diluting the concentration of ads in their publication.  It's been years since the ANSWERS were easy to pick out of spam portions of the articles they appear with.  From this agony-inducing swill I found information that looked like it might tell me how to spot the active profile.  ""Look for "".default"" as part of the profile name.  So I looked again,
</p><p>b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
n34593ht.default-release/
n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
q412vz1p.default/
uiaqaxwu.default/
</p><p><br>
All of the profile names contain "".default.""
</p><p><br>
MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO ASK THE QUESTION BELOW.
Then I noticed the dates
</p><p>Months ago   b2uzr27w.default-release-1/
Months ago   n34593ht.default-release/
Two days ago   n6gdm7r8.default-release-1/
Today  q412vz1p.default/
</p><p>Evidently, two days ago, FireFox ditched my profile and gave me a new one.  This leads to my question, my reason for posting this thread:
</p><p>Why?
</p><p>In other words, 
</p><p>Why did FireFox ditch my profile and give me a new two days ago?
</p><p>I understand, you probably don't know why in my particular case.  I am hoping for reasonable guesses or possibilities.

Except for Firefox. No matter which page, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Twitter... no sound for videos. Firefox is quiet. If I check my sound settings, the bar for sound input is not even moving, seems like Firefox is just not recognising or forwarding any sound to my USB G560 speakers.
</p><p>On the other hand, everything works in Google Chrome and sound is brilliant. The problem just seems to be with Firefox. I disabled all audio devices, especially my old audio-out where I had my old speakers. I updated the drivers for Realtek HD Audio (even though I am sure I do not need them for the G560) and also updated again driver for the G560 as well as the Logitech G Hub. Firefox is also the latest version.
</p><p>But nothing. Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560.
</p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices. Re-Installing the G560 drivers does not change anything.
</p><p>So if I wanna have any sound in Firefox I am depending on the error message popping up... which happens only rarely. But that can't be the solution :( It seems to me the problem is with Firefox, in the way it handles the sound channel or content or whatever... and does not recognize my G560 via USB as speaker system. Even though it is the only one set active in my system.

My screen is quiet small (13 inch) so it's quiet anoy when the bookmark bar take a small space of the interface. I just wonder that why Firefox don't make it like Chrome?

</p><p>I use Firefox across my devices (after 5 years of Google Chrome and other Google services). I found one missing piece on the Firefox product in general. It doesn't sync my settings when I log into the new device. The settings I'm talking about are Search Engine and Notification, although I think this can be applied to any other settings that I'm not using or aware of.
Long story short, since I quit using Google Chrome (although I can't quit using Android, I still disable Google services and provide with least of permissions to any services on the mobile device) I switched back to Mozilla Firefox browser and using in on all my devices (Windows, couple of Linux Desktops as well as Android) and I found that when I login to my Firefox account I still have to change Search Engine from Google to DuckDuckGo and I wonder why Extensions are being installed and synced while search engines are not. Also same thing for Notifications. I don't like being notified and disable all kind of notifications for all Web Sites (no exclusions).  Can you please include these pieces to sync when login to the account or have a checkbox in case if some users want to keep different settings on different devices etc...?

</p><p>I usually have lots of tabs open, and I opened all the tabs on my new computer that I had had on the old one.

I closed the window with the single tab, and continued using the window with many tabs.  At the end of the day, I closed the window as usual and shut down the computer.
</p><p>The next day, I turned on my computer, opened up firefox, and no tabs!  I checked to make sure that ""open previous session at startup"" was checked in the main settings, did some searching through the help files here, and found that the problem was that I hadn't gone in to the privacy settings to tell it to remember history.  I fixed that, and did some more digging to figure out how to restore history, I don't remember how.  I restarted Firefox, and it restored a previous session ... but not the one I wanted.  It restored the window with the single tab that I'd only had open for about ten minutes, not the window with all my tabs (including that one) that I'd had open all day.  Some more searching through the support here and I figured out how to restore the session I ACTUALLY wanted.  I can't find the post now, but it told me to go to Help - Troubleshooting Information (I think--it LOOKED like the Troubleshooting Information page, from what I remember, although today it doesn't seem to have the option I used yesterday, so it might have been a different page) and see if there were two sessions, and if so, to click the other one, and see if that fixed things.  It did!  I got the window with all the tabs back, and closed the window with just the single tab, and went on with my day.  Problem solved, right?
</p><p>No.  I booted up my computer today, opened up Firefox, and what did I find?  IT OPENED THE WINDOW WITH THE SINGLE TAB THAT I'D ONLY HAD OPEN BRIEFLY, INSTEAD OF THE WINDOW WITH ALL MY TABS IN IT THAT I'D HAD OPEN ALL DAY.  First of all, I'd rather not have to deal with this again, so how can I make sure it doesn't?  What is going on?
</p><p>Second, I can't find the help page that told me how to restore the correct window.  This is a problem, because although all of the tabs I had open yesterday are in my history, when I go to the little library icon and look at ""history"" both the ""recently closed windows"" and ""recently closed tabs"" are empty.  As far as Firefox is concerned, I haven't closed any windows or tabs since the last time the history was deleted, despite having lots of pages in the Recent History list that I sure don't have open right now.  Clicking the three horizontal lines to get the main menu, there is no ""restore previous session"" as an option.  I can go through the history and manually click on all the tabs that should be open, but that is REALLY a pain and I would like not to have to do this again.  I have added the ""Tab Session Manager"" addon, so hopefully even if this is a recurring problem I can use that to get around it.  (The addons listed below are all the addons I had when the problem occurred.)  What the heck is going on here?

I've had the  issue for about a month. I've found it incredibly handy to open the download folder from the drop down menu of the download icon. And that option is not available if the the download fails. Instead, a repeat download icon is displayed. So, I've had to comply and re-start the download every time. 
</p><p>Wondering if the first download was indeed faulty, I navigated to the download folder using Explorer and found the page replicated just fine. But it turns out that the second download screws up my fonts and formatting. This I did not know until today.
</p><p>To see if I could figure out the difference between the first download and the repeat thereof, I created two folders, 'first' and 'second' as sub-folders to the download folder. Because I would overwrite the files with the repeat download, I preserved the first download by moving those files into the first folder. The first folder now contained a .htm file and a files sub-folder. The original download location was empty. I then repeated the download, and found but a single .htm file was downloaded. 
</p><p>When I open the single .htm file, the fonts are messed up as well as the formatting. So, thinking that the second download needed it's _files directory, I copied that back, and sure enough everything looked good again. I also compared the first .htm file with the second, and they are identical.
</p><p>My next test was to copy (not move) the _files folder to preserve it, between the first and second download, then compare them. There are differences! There's an extra .htm file in the first download, that's missing in the second. There's an extra .xht file in the second download that is missing in the first. There's a zero length file in each download with unique names, not in the other: mark1_data exists in the first download; a_data in the second. I assumed that zero length files would be fruitless to test further.
</p><p>I next tried to add the missing .htm file from the first download into the second _files folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting. I also removed the extra file from the second folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting either.
</p><p>I'll attach the difference listing between the _files folders. The left side has red highlighting and is against the first _files folder and identifies files present there, but not in the second. The right side has green highlighting and is against the second _files folder and shows files present that are not in the first. I'll also attach a sample of good fonts/formatting from the first download, and bad fonts/formatting from the second.

I did not set it to clear history automatically, I didn't clear the history since I hit the button to close and did not clear my history before closing it. All my history data is non-existent. Today is 11/28/2019 and I can only see the history from August and the months before it. I can't seem to find a way to recover my history and apparently there is no contact support to report this... frustrating!

Chrome has this very convenient feature that keeps a history item from opening on top of your current page - often you want to compare or add what you saw in history to what you're seeing on the current page without making the current page disappear and having to backpage, thus losing the history page you want displayed at the same time. This seems like an easy enough feature to include that FF is ignoring, like it ignores the longtime request that Firefox enable cut &amp; paste to retain website formatting and functions when pasting into an email (and screenshots don't retain functions like links). If there are enough inconveniences to using FF, people use another browser, and if Chrome and Safari can include such conveniences, so can Firefox.

The problem appeared after I had updated to version 68 from version 62.0.2. It was fixed back then by setting <em>media.media-capabilities.enabled</em> = <strong>false</strong> in <strong>about:config</strong>. After updating to version 70.0.1, it is back and is now worse than before. I have tried tweaking other settings in about:config as well but none seems to solve the problem. Can someone kindly help me in this regard? I had to ask this question separately as I did not get any more replies to my update in the original question. Again, please note that only 1080p 60 fps throws up this problem, and not any other quality option (60 fps or otherwise). Moreover, other browsers work fine with all quality options. Only Firefox version 68 and later show this problem. Thanks and regards!

Obviously this looked fishy to me and I didn't click; instead I killed Firefox via the command line and then restarted it.  When I did, one of my windows didn't look right (I had two windows open, each with several tabs)-- the tab bar at the top just cut off halfway through one of the tabs instead of me being able to scroll over.  In addition, right after I was playing a game on my computer and part of the game board froze.  Now everything seems normal.  Is it possible I managed to end up with some malware even though I didn't click on the link?  Has anyone seen this particular scam before?

I have tried using the ""custom"" option and deselecting the 4 tracker options but every site still has ETP enabled, and it is far too time consuming to have to manually turn it off for every website I visit. I would like to find out 1) what I'm doing wrong that the method I've tried to disable ETP isn't working (yes, I reload the page every time), and 2) is there an ""about:config"" tweak that will turn off ETP globally, as in across the web, and on every new FF session I start? I really don't care who tracks me, but I do care about a feature that makes browsing more tedious and painful. I am using Chrome and Opera in the interim between discovering this annoying ""enhancement"" and when the FF developers fix it so it can be disabled with one click on a more global and permanent basis. Chrome and Opera don't break websites by default.

I recently noticed that decoding youtube videos in 2160p60fps is choppy beyond recognition.
</p><p>Diagnose:
While playing said videos in firefox i was able to observe in the task manager that actually none of my graphics cards video decoding capabilities were used. At lower video qualities/resolutions the hardware accelerated video decoding of the graphics card was also not kicking in, but in these cases my cpu was still able to cope with the decoding load, so I never noticed the missing hardware acceleration.  To narrow the origin of problem down I tried watching the same videos in edge, chrome and even downloaded a short 2160p60fps clip to play with VLC and everything worked fine, just not in my favorite browser firefox :(

-Restart Firefox without addons
-Refresh Firefox
-Create a new Profile

Nvidia Driver Version 441.20

Is that the right solution?

""Disappears"" = turns white (despite background or other colors) and becomes non-actionable (screen shot attached).
Possible connection: it most often happens during or after using the horrible Blackboard program (web-based version) for my online classes. However, I have seen it happen when Blackboard was not currently in use, and once it happened after a reboot when Blackboard had not been used at all that session.
If I have multiple browser windows open (which is rare--I use tabs), they are all affected at the same time.
If I close Firefox and open it in a new window, the problem exists on the new window too.
When it happens, the only recourse is to reboot my computer entirely.
Aside from changing the auto-download location, I have not customized Firefox and have not installed any plugins. (Some may have been installed automatically such as those for Microsoft Office.)

Cuando quería entrar a facebook, me aparecían guardadas otras cuentas de 2 personas que no conozco,a una de ellas se podía entrar, pues su contraseña estaba guardada.
Cuando quise entrar a cuentas de google, y buscar alguna de mis cuentas, encontré que hay otra cuenta desconocida que tampo es mía, a esa no pude entrar.
La verdad no entiendo como esas cuentas pudiero quedar registradas en mi cuenta de firefox sync. lo unico que s eme ocurre, es que el firefox sync este fallando y enlazando cuentas que no son.
o que algun complemento de firefox hubiera vulnerado esa seguridad.

ii is created in this location:
C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\95dg4iaz.default
at one time i read that ""Firefox will always create a datarepoting folder"", but you used to be able to delete the datareporting folder in the Profiles folder and it would not come back.

I've never had any issues with anything.
I've had the same 3 extensions running since the installation of Firefox(Momentum tabs, Popup blocker and uBlock Origin) 
</p><p>But recently, Firefox has been uploading insane amount of data to the point where it just does not make sense.
I'm adding two images, 1st shows my trend over the last 4 months while the 2nd shows how much data Firefox has been sending while being on (with a reset) for about 4h.
</p><p>It became an issue because i usually do not close my computer and leave Firefox open with the tabs open (on average 5) and it was consuming all that data while i was at work
While a ""fix"" could be well, close your Firefox, if this keeps up I'll just switch browser.
</p><p>As far as what tabs are kept open a few Stock images website, GogoAnime, and usually my e-mails or work where i've left it off.
No streaming website is left opened
</p><p>I've got no active VPN connections, I've got complete control of my network and am beyond 100% certain that the issue comes from firefox, no other IP are on my network and lastly disabling all of my extensions has not changed the behavior of Firefox.
My Firefox is up to date, (70.0.1) so everything else on my computer, from windows, gpu to all other drivers
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, otherwise i'll just change browser. (tried leaving on Chrome and it hardly uploads anything whatsoever)

</p><p>Since a few months ago, Firefox started syncing add-on settings without giving you the option to opt out of it. I'm not talking about syncing the add-ons themselves which is a great thing and also the user can turn it off. I'm talking about add-on settings, syncing of which can be problematic. For example, I have a few website blocker add-ons. I have given these add-ons a list of websites to block on my older son's computer, while I have given them a different list to block on my younger son's computer. This is not viable anymore because Firefox syncs all their settings without asking me. The other problem is that even the disable/enable option of these add-ons are synced, which means that if I have these website blockers enabled on my sons' computers, they are also enabled on my own computer. Consequently, if I disable them on my own computer, they will be disabled on my sons' computers. This is a major issue. I have previously contacted Firefox about this, but I assume it has been lost in the large number feedback that they receive.
</p><p>The blocker add-on was just an example, so please don't offer me solutions for that one add-on. This needs to be fixed for all add-ons.
</p><p>Thank you for reading.

</p><p>I never did any housekeeping on this mountain of logins. But it suffices to say that before the inclusion of lockwise, showing the list of stored credentials exhibited a delay of some seconds (on a 4th gen core i5) between pressing the buttons to show them and actually opening a window displaying them!
</p><p>This, happily, changed with lockwise (which also solved some problems on my android devices). I was amazed with the fact that the credentials window opened very fast.
</p><p>Now I'd normally be very happy with this change. However, I noticed that lockwise in firefox (windows) displays the number of logins/passwords at the upper left. It showed <strong>999</strong>... Which is an extremely round number. Coupled with the fact that it opens very fast now, I'm afraid that some change might have occured leading to credentials loss!
</p><p>Are you aware if a credential limit exists <strong>now</strong> on firefox regarding credential management, or whether a credential loss/data loss has been reported on the sync cloud?
</p><p>This is *hugely* important for me, stability of this feature would be enough for me to switch to another browser.
</p><p>I think I have a number of rolling backups on one of my sync-connected Windows PC. When were the new lockwise-related changes introduced? Asking here, in order to check a backup older than that.

I doubt there are any, but I have no way of knowing what stupid things their site maintainers / code may do if they detect a  really old browser.
</p><p>I've read there are other ways to sniff the browser than a few ""general.useragent..."" prefs, but I'm no expert.  Doubt they are, either.
</p><p>They must use a contract vendor to run the site.  It's been &gt;&gt; a month since 1st asked them to tell me what they use to sniff the browser, because it was up to date &amp; ""general.useragent.override"" reflected that.  Generally, their IT dept isn't very helpful.  I had to call them to tell them to upgrade OpenSSL when the big bug surfaced while back, after ~ 90% of financial institutions had upgraded.  They knew nothing of it.  Still waiting for a ""thanks for your help."" 
</p><p>For grins, I entered a science fiction blended UA string just to see what their system would say:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)  Gecko/20100101 Chrome/74.0.3729.169.
Obviously, Chrome doesn't use Gecko engine.
</p><p>So their site didn't complain about outdated browser or screwy UA string.  Their site displayed the same as always.  I purposely mixed &amp; matched the string.  In fact, I didn't change the UA string back to a valid one yet &amp; this site is displaying OK.
</p><p>One issue in using any browser in LInux (as useragent string)  is a very small pool of users, increasing fingerprint ability.
If I found out that most sites (if using desktops) work fine, even if you spoof the OS AND browser, there'd be a much larger group of Windows 10 / Chrome users vs. Linux / Fx users.

</p><p>I'm still using an older version of firefox to keep essential add-ons that Quantum no longer had.  I'm having problems on a windows 7 computer with the version I have on it, and would like advice on the best way to proceed.  
</p><p>I had copied over my profile from a different computer where I'd been using FF55.  I'd had some problems with 55, so I installed 52 on this computer, but using that profile.  It's not working very well as I can't get vertical tabs or vertical tabs reloaded to work, it's also crashing fairly often for no apparent reason, etc.  Now even the ""+"" symbol to add a new tab has disappeared from the tab bar, and I don't have a clue why or how to get it back!).  For what it's worth, this isn't a malware/virus problem - I'm running McAfee and also periodically malwarebytes etc., and scans aren't finding problems. Computer has been restarted several times and so on, and I'm still having the problems.  Could this be because the profile was from a firefox 55 version and it's being used on a FF52 version? Or would that not cause this sort of problem?
</p><p>I don't want to go to 56 because I gather it won't be able to access my older saved sessions (I use Session Manager and those are the sessions I'm concerned about - so if this is NOT a problem, please let me know).  I'm concerned about this because wiki says:  ""...Another change was the introduction of the mozlz4 format, a proprietary variant of the lz4 compression format (.mozlz4 and .jsonlz4 file extensions instead of .json.lz4 as per unix/linux standard). Session data is stored in the lz4 format instead of plain text. Firefox 56 can not recognize the legacy plain text session files, only the lz4-encoded ones....""
</p><p>So I'm wondering if I should go to 55 on this computer, or 52ESR?  I gather the ESR would have better security - but want to know if there's a difference in add-on compatibility or other features since 52ESR is, I gather, based on older code than 55?
</p><p>If someone could talk me thru the pros and cons of using 55 versus 52ESR I'd sure appreciate it!!!
</p><p>Also, I would be VERY grateful if folks could point me towards:
1. a reasonably safe site where we can search and install legacy add-ons
2. any webpage which has a good information showing which legacy add-ons now have reasonable replacements in the current FF version.

I noticed this issue quite a few times: When I open the cookies privacy settings, the two buttons ""Clear Data"" and ""Manage Data"" often appear grayed out.
I don't use private browsing or disabled offline cache like I saw in other threads, and I use only 4 regular extensions.
The funny thing is that the buttons become functional on their own after a couple of minutes if I just leave the tab open.
So it seems that Firefox is running some very long process before enabling these buttons the first time the settings page is opened.
If I close the privacy settings tab and open it again, then these two buttons immediately appear enabled, not grayed out.
</p><p>Firefox should probably change the very confusing and counter-intuitive way it is handling these two buttons, or at least display some animated icon to indicate it is doing some stuff, but if it's reading all cookies before deciding to enable the two buttons (and I don't think I have an unusual number of cookies), I'd rather have Firefox enable these buttons immediately and run this cookies analysis process AFTER I click on one of these two buttons, not before.
By the way, it would be great if the about:support page could provide the number of cookies or web sites with cookies so we might use this for technical support. I have no idea how many I have and if this number is a problem.
</p><p>In any case, for all other users that experience the grayed out cookie management buttons: Leave the settings tab open, do other stuff on Firefox or the computer, and come back to this settings tab after a few minutes, you'll find the two buttons enabled.

</p><p>Back in 2015, Mozilla destroyed the search bar by removing the text labels, making it almost impossible to search because you can't find the engine you want. They also removed the ability to switch engines, meaning you have to nominate your engine every single time you search.
</p><p>On top of this, Mozilla reversed the order you do things: It used to be that first you chose the type of content you wanted, then you thought about your exact query. But now, you first have to specify your exact query and THEN think about the type of content you want to search for, which is totally counter-intuitive and terrible interface design. It's like being asked for the name of the meal, movie or book you want, before you've even decided whether you want a meal, movie or book!
</p><p>The reason Mozilla gave for these awful changes was to ""make searching faster"", but that simply is not the case. The new search bar requires just as many clicks, yet it's drastically slower to use as it's almost impossible to find the engine you're looking for from all the unlabeled engines. Plus, having to type your query first is completely counterintuitive to the user's thought process and slows things down even further.
</p><p>Solution:
</p><p>For a couple of years, Classic Theme Restorer was the perfect solution, bringing back the old bar exactly as it should be. However, since Firefox Quantum, Classic Theme Restorer doesn't work, so I've been using Jefferson Scher's excellent userchrome script. (Thank you Mr Scher!)
</p><p>Sadly, with Firefox 70, the script seems to be broken again and many of the engines are missing from the list. I've tried taking the script directly from Jefferson Scher's website, but doing so just makes text labels disappear. It just seems to be broken again.

It is a good system as designed - but I found that one of my W10 PCs had only two backups, and all of them had huge gaps in the saved-bookmark dates. A few sequential, then a gap of weeks or months and another set - but hardly any more than two days in a row. And old backups are pretty useless to me.
This is odd because have been I using FF as my main browser for a while now - I would expect consistent backing up every day.
So why are the backups so unreliable? Is there anything I can do to make sure FF backs up every day (like it is supposed to!) ? My FF installs are kept up to date. 
It is a worry, any suggestions/explanations most welcome!

""Using an older version of Firefox can corrupt bookmarks and browsing history already saved to an existing Firefox profile. To protect your information, create a new profile for this installation of Firefox.""
Because I am forced to create a new profile I can´t access the original profile with the certificate I need. 
I tried going to about:profiles and setting as default to no avail several times.
I have tried the firefox.exe -P command as well. 
I can´t import the cert9.db file to the certificates setting. I also tried moving the cert9 file to another profile while Firefox is closed but I because I must create a new profile when I open it again and can´t switch profiles once its open it doesn´t make a difference. I´m running out of ideas and it was such a hassle to get the certificate in the first place I can´t afford to lose it. 
Is there another way around creating a new profile? Or anything I´m not considering?

</p><p>I have FF 68.2.0ESR 32bit on Win7. I now want to move to a different machine, using Linux (RHEL8) with FF 68.1.0 ESR 64Bit. 
I transferred the profile from the Windows machine to the Linux machine and everything came over perfectly. But the passwords are not offered after selecting a login.
Example: There is a page with ""login"" and ""password"". I have two accounts for this page. I click into ""login"" and both login-names are offered by firefox. I select one account. Now I'd expect that the password is filled automatically. But it isn't. Even if I click also into the ""password"" field. The same with pages where I have only one account.
</p><p>I found some threads where key3.db is mentioned. I searched in my profile folder and didn't find a key3.db but a key4.db. I created a copy of key4.db and named it key3.db. No success. 
The permissions of the files where 600 (rw-------). Ich changed them to 644. -&gt; No success.

</p><p>Finally decided to make a topic about it as all of my attempts in the past few months to fix it have been in vain.
Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally.
</p><p>I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed.
</p><p>The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it.
</p><p>(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text)
</p><p>From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates.
</p><p>Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here?
</p><p>Thanks in advance,
Rasmus

I was taken to an App called ""Authy"".
After spending ten minutes filling in all the crap they want for me to establish an account, I added them to 1Password and opened the application.  The FIRST instruction is for the User to ADD the site they will be using Authy to retrieve an Authentication Code in order to log into Firefox.  I typed in Firefox and you are NOT in their list of supported applications.  Facebook, Twitter, Chrome, etc. are all there.  Moreover, I could NOT add Firefox as one of their supported applications.  I had to submit a request.
Did it EVER occur to the Firefox Developers that maybe before you throw up a list of Authenticator Apps that support FireFox, that you first determine if they actually do????????    This is sixth grade coding and a waste of thirty minutes.  It makes me question if any of the supposed features in your browser are anything more than ""Vaporware"".    Listed features that are supposedly running in the background, but actually aren't even coded in.  
I'll skip your security features since its obvious you don't have a clue how to implement them, or they are just there for another type of ""fake marketing scheme"".   
The attachments ARE from the downloaded application, yet there is NOTHING for me to input in Setup04  Attachment Pic, because I can't create an account that is tied to Firefox. 
I don't care if you respond to this because I don't care anymore.

</p><p>Hi there,
</p><p>Thanks for writing in! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble.
</p><p>I believe this is an issue of your browser blocking multiple download from the same site. I have attempted the bulk downloader myself on Chrome and had success with the bundle you mentioned, so that is the only factor I believe may be holding you back. There is an article regarding this issue for the Firefox browser here:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075</a>
</p><p>Installing that add-on may help you correctly download the products in question.
</p><p>If you continue having trouble, let me know and I can discuss this issue with my team further. We may not be able to provide an immediate solution, but we can hopefully address this issue in future updates to this feature.
</p><p>Kind regards,
</p><p>-Finn

<p>Funny, so I try downgrading Flash via YUM, which can't be done as Adobe promptly removes old versions from its repos.
OK, so I just YUM erase Flash, only to achieve an INVALID IcedTea plugin. What?
</p><p>Did I perhaps use FF 68.2 for 2 weeks without noticing the issue? Well if that's the case a downgrade to 68.1 will fix things, right?
So I re-add via YUM the latest Flash plugin, but alas 68.1 still thinks that and IcedTea are INVALID.
</p><p>Mumble. Well let me get the big hammer and further downgrade to FF 60.9, remove pluginreg.dat, fire FF up again and... oh. Still INVALID. Now I'm 100% sure there's something weird - but what is it?

Audio is fine in general.
However, when I try to skip ahead in a video (YouTube, e.g.), I can hear a very small but audible ""pop"" sound from my headphone, which is super annoying.
My UNEDUCATED guess is my headphone seems to turn off instantly when the video starts buffering, and then turn back on again when buffering is done.
Any idea I can deal with this issue?

I have tested Edge, Opera, and Chrome.
Edge is behaving the same way as Firefox does.
Chrome and Opera is fine without that ""pop"" sound when skipping video ahead.

With Javascript, I change divs, tables, &amp;c., from display:none to, e.g., display:block.  All the attributes work EXCEPT the background image.  So, for example, if background color is #000000, the background shows solid black, and if I change that ahead of time or even on the fly to, e.g., #FF0000, the background changes onclick to solid red.  But, the background image appears pretty much at random as the computer pleases.  So, for example, the background-image is set by css for a table where display:none is the setting.  The template changes the table to display:inline-block.  The table appears, the background color appears, but often no background image appears UNLESS I open the console and uncheck, then recheck some property, e.g., height, associated with the background image.  If, however, I set the initial table property to, e.g., display:inline, the initial result shows a bunch of garbage, but once the display is switched to inline-block, all the background images appear normally and regularly.  This appears to be some kind of bug with Firefox, but for the life of me, I cannot fix it.  If the display of an element -- article, div, table -- starts in the css as ""none,"" the background image often does not appear when display is switched on.

Anyway, the desktop pc updated fine but when i came to use my laptop at the weekend Firefox was nowhere to be found and wouldn't respond to any icon clicks and in Windows control panel 'Programs &amp; features' suggested that it may have been uninstalled. Frustrated, i decided to fully uninstal and download and re-install afreash. However, after doubleclicking the .exe Firefox install file the process stalls after unpacking saying ""You may not have the necessary permissions to use all the features of the program you are about to run. You may run this program as  a different user or continue to run the program as the current user."" The two options are; run as current user or run as administrator (with associated password field). Choosing the first option then stalls the instal process. Choosing the second option there is a login or password conflict, even though the current user 'is' the administrator account.

Weird thing, here.  I'm trying to help a friend of mine.  Recently Firefox on his Windows 10 laptop will not open google as his home page.  When he opens Firefox the status bar indicates it's attempting a TLS handshake with google but after many, many seconds a blank page appears.  I have made sure it's set as his home page and have done a refresh on Firefox.  What's weird (to me, anyway) is that I can set any other page as his home page and it will open up directly into that page.  Not google.

I reset my router to ""factory"" and installed most current router firmware but that did not help.  Netgear Support has been unable to help.  2.  In current LastPass addon, I have to re-login to LastPass every time I start Firefox - did not used to do that (a year ago), and in Chrome or Edge that does not happen.   I have re-installed the LastPass add-on.  I have upgraded Firefox many times and have cleared history/cache many times.  
So now I want to COMPLETELY remove Firefox, reboot,  and then install Firefox from scratch.  Can someone please point me to the web page that tells me how to properly remove all of Firefox so that I can re-download/install it from the beginning?

Asi que lo que hice fue crear dos perfiles, el default lo llamé ""home"" e hice uno nuevo llamado ""work"". Luego en ~/.local/share/applications/ hice dos accesos de escritorio:

</p><p>La única diferencia entre uno y el otro es que uno ejecuta el perfil home y el otro ejecuta el perfil work y cada uno tiene sus menus contextuales para gnome por separado para cada perfil.
</p><p>Entonces, desde el menú de gnome3 he agregado ambos accesos de firefox y funcionan muy bien, cuando hago click sobre el ícono firefox home inicia firefox con el perfil personal y cuando hago click a firefox work me aparece el perfil de trabaj con las pestañas, archivos y accesos del trabajo.
</p><p>El problema es que cuando inicio firefox este no mantiene el contexto de ejecución de la aplicación en el ícono de gnome, se crea un tercer ícono de firefox en el menú lateral y cuando inicio los dos perfiles estos se mezclan en este mismo tercer ícono.
</p><p>¿Porqué sucede esto?, ¿Cómo puedo hacer para que la ejecución de firefox quede asociada al ícono que lo ejecuta solamente?
</p><p>Por otro lado, no sería mala idea que Firefox pudiera utilizar de manera mas cómoda los perfiles y poder intercambiar entre uno y otro. Antiguamente usaba los grupos de pestaña para englobar mis pestañas del trabajo y los personales, pero desde que los eliminaron que he tenido que mezclar todo y uso muchas pestañas y se me hace un desorden, los grupos de pestaña eran una genialidad y me ayudaba a ordenar y separar todo. Así como lo hace Android por ejemplo que es capaz de mantener perfiles de trabajo y separar la ejecución de una misma app en dos contextos (trabajo y personal) en dos iconos separados (uno con una insignia de maletín), asi mismo sería genial que firefox tuviera la posibilidad de crear perfiles dentro del mismo navegador y poder acceder a estos perfiles a traves de accesos directos diferentes con insignias definidas por el usuario, talves de una lista pequeña de insignias que sean nativas de firefox, asi podriamos tener perfiles de pentetsing, desarrollo, personal, trabajo, etc. Me dirás ¿porqué no hacer todo eso en un mismo perfil?: porque por ejemplo para desarrollo uso github, para el trabajo tambien y cada ves que trabajo debo cambiar de cuenta, estar cerrando sesion y luego a la noche estar volviendo a iniciar sesion con mis cuentas personales, algo similar le pasa a la gente que usa facebook web de manera personal y para sus pequeñas empresas, por ejemplo conozco a gente que debe usar chrome y firefox al mismo tiempo para poder usar dos perfiles de facebook a la ves.

Is what I want to do now not possible? My Firefox browser is up to date (70.0.1). Thanks.

</p><p>As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css (see below for more info) that reduce the width of the address bar once placed in the Firefox <em>Profile</em> folder. In order to do that create a Folder named <em>chrome</em> on the desktop. Step two: Create a .TXT file, rename the Extention from <em>.txt</em> to <em>css</em> rename it <em>userChrome.css"" and place into the </em>Profile<em> folder with the following Code 
</em>
</p>
<pre>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keyoligarch/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keyoligarch/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>""); /* numbers are adjustable */

#urlbar-container { max-width: 400px !important; }

#search-container { max-width: 200px !important; }</pre>
<p>In order to Locate the folder, 
If your Firefox was installed by .EXE file the <em>Profiles"" folder will not the Program Files Folder (In order to locate it 1. Hit the Windows button Lower left 2. Hit </em>This PC<em> 3. Locate C Drive 4. Go to Users, Find the name you named your PC 4. AppData 5. Roaming 6. Mozilla 7. Firefox 8. Profiles) unless you are using the </em>Portable version"" in which case the <em>Profile</em> folder is in the <em>Data</em> Folder.   Or just search for <em>Mozilla"" to find the Data folder from there, then open the Profile folder. 
</em>
</p><p>The scripts still works, again as mentioned on the 1st line of this post, As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css. So you will have to enable it to do so, or it won't work. In order to do that 
(1) Open a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.
(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste the word <em>userprof</em> if it's disabled, double click it to enable it. 
(3) In the search box above the list, search for <em>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</em> preference is not already set to true, double-click it to switch the value from false to true.
</p><p>(4) Close Mozilla Firefox 
(5) Insert the <em>chrome</em> folder you created it into the Firefox Profile folder (Tips on how to find that folder, above).
(6) Insert the userChrome.css file with the code in it (Instructions above) into the chrome folder in Profile folder. 
(7) Open Firefox.
</p><p>Sidenotes. The numbers located in the userChrome.css file are adjustable. If your URL/Adress Bar are too long or short,
lower the number incrementally to suite your preference. This is a working Tutorial as of Firefox 70.0.01 
</p><p>I thought i'd take time to create this because I had much difficulty trying to find the solution. Hope this helps.

Things like Gmail (I have two accounts for work plus my own, so three all together), it will not just be logged out, but it will rearrange where the tabs are.  It will move several of the tabs to different locations.  It does this on multiple devices that I have synced to my account.  It is only Firefox that does this.  I have things set up in Chrome and Edge and those don't change.

This is happening on my Win10 machine - my Win7 box is not having any issues since the update.
</p><p>I have followed the advice of creating new profiles, checking for locked profiles (and being unable to remove the lock?).  I have completely removed Firefox from my system - uninstalled via control panel, deleted all folders in Program Files and Users etc, removed temp files and edited the registry to completely remove any Mozilla/Firefox entries.  Completely clean install - as far as I can tell - but the problem re-appears as soon as Firefox is reinstalled.  I've tried all this in WIn10 safe mode as well but still no joy.
</p><p>The issue seems to be that there is a process running that cannot be terminated but I'm unable to kill the single remaining Firefox.exe process listed in task manager.  When I try 'taskkilll /IM firefox.exe /F' from the command prompt I get an error that the process can't be killed as an instance of it does not exist.  If I try 'taskkill /IM firefox.exe /T /F' it advises that a child process is keeping the main process alive - explorer.exe.  Terminating explorer.exe does not free up the firefox.exe process for termination (same error of the instance not existing).  The only way to clear the process is to reboot my system, Firefox will then start ok but when closed the issue will occur again.
</p><p>I'm on my 4th clean install and the issue persists, so any help or advice beyond what I've tried would be appreciated.

Why did/would a clock stop the functional app/site to work?","<p>Before I did the ""latest updates"" from October 31, all these apps &amp; sites worked fine (videos, games, etc). Now after I did the update suddenly instead it says:

Firefox detected an issue and did not continue to <a href=""http://gate.starislandgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gate.starislandgames.com</a>. The website is either misconfigured or your computer clock is set to the wrong time.
It’s likely the website’s certificate is expired, which prevents Firefox from connecting securely. If you visit this site, attackers could try to steal information like your passwords, emails, or credit card details.
What can you do about it?
Your computer clock is set to 11/8/2019. Make sure your computer is set to the correct date, time, and time zone in your system settings, and then refresh <a href=""http://gate.starislandgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gate.starislandgames.com</a>.

</pre>
<p>This has NEVER happened before. Some of those also don't work/function on Chrome. It obviously isn't my clock, it's either Facebook &amp; other sites running the videos &amp; games or a certain site running them. The first sentence said (after the Did Not Connect part) makes it sound like YOU/Mozilla stopped it from working or going to the site, even though it's clearly the site itself that doesn't work in general (maybe from that expired certificate, NOT because it's an hour off LOL, OR they got attacked with malware like some others in past months). At least I know it's not just me that can't use those apps for now.

</p><p>This isn't what I want, because I do want to be updating Firefox regularly, but I do not want it to interrupt things I am in the middle of working on to do it by *refusing to load pages* until I restart it.
</p><p>This is a nightmare when working on things that require multiple tabs, or worse when I'm submitting something via a form as this restart page and forced restart destroys what I was doing.
</p><p>I would be happy for it to automatically install the update on next restart. I will tolerate nag screens to remind me to restart the browser as soon as is practical. I *cannot* tolerate it absolutely ruining what I was doing by suddenly showing a demand to restart instead of the page I just submitted, or having something half written I need to check something for in another tab to find that I cannot do that and so cannot finish what I was doing before restarting.
</p><p>This update process is hostile, and disabling updates entirely is not at all what I want to do, I just want to control where my workflow is interrupted and avoid LOSS of work. But I can only seem to find the extreme options of no updates at all, or automatic updates that will randomly ruin what I am doing.
</p><p>If this is the new reality for Firefox I'll have to find something else to use, but having spent several hours trying to find a fix for this - and this not being the first time I looked as this has impacted me several times previously - even if there is a workaround it's incredibly poor form to not allow this option in a simple manner or to have such information easy to find.

I am trying to find the history of a specific URL, like the last time I opened it yesterday, but it seems that the most information History records or shows is the last time I opened it (today) and the total number of times I accessed this URL (4). I can't find any actual history of this URL in the History library. Am I missing something, or does the History feature record only the last access?
This would be very bad and a far cry from any kind of history.
Also, the Search feature does not seem to take into account the range of dates selected in the left pane. For instance, if I select ""September"" and search for my URL, it returns the URL that I accessed in November and that didn't even exist in September. The Search feature could be a little more contextual, and work on the whole history only if the root ""History"" folder is selected. But that's aside the main question, how to find the full history of a specific URL, not just its last access time.
Thanks.

I tried the device management in my account page, but I can't see anything on my new PC except itself, meanwhile I can see my old PC and iPhone itself on my iOS Firefox. I tried to re-sign in on my iPhone, and shockingly found that I can only use my old password to successfully sign in, the new password working on my new PC is a wrong one for my phone.
Then I tried to delete the account with new password on PC. After delete successful, sign in on my PC with that E-mail was correctly reported as ""unknown account"", but I can still sign in with the exact same E-mail and the old password on my phone, like nothing happened at all. At the same time, even if I tried the exact same combination of E-mail and old password on PC, the result is always ""unknown account"", like it already be deleted.

</p><p>My first time here, just recently switched from Chrome to Firefox, but seems like it's a bit problematic. 
Version 70.0 worked fine, but ever since 70.0.1, Firefox starts crashing (randomly). 99% of the time there is no error message, the browser just crashes(closes) and that's it, no crash report, no error, the only thing I can do is to restore previous session. Usually, after crashing, it will crash again 2-3 times upon opening the browser, until it will finally work...for a while. 
Rarely there have been errors, saying the same thing - memory could not be read (attached in the post). Does not happen with any other browsers. All my drivers and software are up to date, memory is OK, (did windows memory diag and memtest86), hardware is okay, tried disabling plugins and hardware acceleration, still nothing. All that ever since 70.0.1, before that it worked fine. Is it just me or anyone else having that problem? 
If any additional info is needed, let me know.

</p><p>I do the IT support for my dad (85+ years): 
Firefox 70.0.1 64 bit on Windows 10 Home 64 bit, all up to date.
He has various passwords saved in FF, but I specifically instructed FF to exempt the sites he uses for Online Banking sites from saving passwords. 
</p><pre>  ""Access &amp; Passwords"" &gt; Exceptions: sites listed (entered by clicking ""NEVER save"" when asked on login). 
</pre>
<p>I have FF delete all data upon closure: 
</p><pre>  ""Delete history when FF is closed"" all EXCEPT for ""Website Settings"" (which I learned would also kill the password save barrier)
</pre>
<p>Now, I don't know what my dad does; every time I check after a week these settings are gone and FF is happily back, offering the saved login details to his Online Banking sites, also the Exception list is empty. My dad cannot say what he did to change this and maintains ""he didn't do anything"" (see also: typical IT support customer statements). 
Sometimes I find he has even reinstalled FF for no good reason (which I can see in the Apps bar). But this should not affect the Profile settings, and even if he should have agreed to delete profile data: the bookmarks are still there, so it's not all gone. 
</p><p>For now I have deactivated FF from saving any passwords, which is the safe choice when Online Banking is involved (no, my dad won't agree to close the Online Banking Account altogether go to the bank). But this creates new problems with all the other less sensitive sites where he needs to enter passwords (newspaper sites etc.), which he misplaces and keeps on resetting them (to passwords which he will again not remember the next time round). 
</p><p>My next thought was to set permissions.sqlite to read-only, as I found this is where FF stores the exception list. Unfortunately, I realized that FF apparently updates this file every time it's run and ignores it if it finds it is out of sync with what it expects, returning to the clear sheet. So this doesn't help. 
</p><p>I guess I could set up an autorun batch file to delete the profile directory and restore a golden reference directory, but this could be error-prone too. 
</p><p>So I was wondering if the community can point me to a way to permanently fix a given list of Password-Save-Exceptions which cannot be altered by the user? Something like a config setting, available or hidden? 
</p><p>Thanks for any advice or pointers,

I had inadvertently removed my bookmark webpage star from my browser (Firefox v.70).  I searched and couldn't find an answer as to how to get it back on my address bar.  The closest answer involved clicking the ""Page actions"" (which looks like an ellipses; 3 dots) button which is adjacent to the bookmark webpage star button by default.  Both were missing from my address bar.
</p><p>So I refreshed the browser and had to manually adjust all my settings again and reload my 2 extensions however neither the ""Page actions"" button nor the bookmark webpage star button were present after the refresh.  
</p><p>Solution:  
Refresh the browser.
Right-click on an empty area of whatever webpage.
A context menu will popup with a star that appears in the upper right side of that popup window.  
Make your new bookmark and click ""Done"".
When I did this both my ""Page actions"" and ""Bookmark Star"" were back in my address bar.
</p><p>I hope this helps people like me who find either or both of those missing.

After browsing for a while when I open a new tab and try to load a web page large parts of Firefox become unresponsive, for example I can close other tabs, move tabs, use websites in other Firefox windows largely unaffected but I cannot view other tabs in the window I opened the crashing tab. The unresponsive tab just sits there with a loading animation in the tab name, white screen, what ever website I tried to visit cleared from the address bar.
</p><p>Opening additional tabs is possible but the crashing window will not switch to those tabs, while in another window I can open a new tab but actually visiting a site or opening a link in a new tab will crash that window. 
</p><p>Opening new windows once I'm crashing results in a crashed window regardless if I use the empty page or load a URL.
</p><p>Lastly if I click on a link before a tab crashes nothing will happen. No tab will open, no tabs will crash, the link won't turn purple. But at this point I can go fully about my business reading the existing loaded content in all my working tabs and windows. Opening the link in a new tab with context menus will crash the new tab immediately.
</p><p>Once a tab has crashed I am forced to close the browser. It usually takes a while to fully shutdown, but it's never unresponsive enough to need to be killed in the Task Manager.
</p><p>And sometimes this entire process corrupts my profile and I get to re-login to everything on the web again.
</p><p>Now, here's the frustrating part. I don't know how to troubleshoot this. The issue has persisted through:
- Firefox versions 67, 68, and 70
- My machine was re-imaged with a new Windows image when I was upgraded to an SSD. The previous image didn't have Firefox preinstalled, the new image did(68). I purged that and installed 70 and the issue continues.
- I have disabled hardware acceleration multiple times(because my profile keeps getting reset).
- There are no crash logs.
- I haven't taken to time to reproduce the error with no extensions but I've A/B tested that I can crash running just uBlock or just Tusk. I'm not running a lot of extensions because the profile keeps getting reset.
- Firefox isn't actually crashing, no crash reports are being generated, Windows event log is clean.

There has GOT to be a better answer. It's been too many years of this making excuses.
</p><p>If nothing else, can't someone develop JUST a rinky dinky program/add-in that loops through all open pages one by one, closing, pausing while we check Taskman, then reopening so we can see the effect? That would be TRIVIAL for someone to write just that crude thing. But it would save people breathtaking amounts of time because we're having to do this manually, over and over and over and over and over. Even with this simple routine, it could be enhanced to record the CPU load from Taskman or TaskInfo or something, since we'd be slowly, ploddingly writing down or pasting the results as I stepped through the pages one by one.
</p><p>Better yet, ideally, just do this, which also should not be technically difficult - seriously. Take some unused field and populate it with identifying information (like the Save As name of the page), then inform Microsoft (for taskman, resmon) and Iars (for TaskInfo) where it is. Or write our own CPU monitor extract just to measure FX CPU, that displays which PID goes with which window)(s).
</p><p>THAT'S WHAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. An indication of which browser instances go with which PIDs. Even if there's some overlap, if PID 6632 is using an entire core and more of my desktop, if I can just even partially limit which browser windows are burning there, that would be enormous.
</p>
<pre>For example
PID....FX-ID
15......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
15......mozilla.com / (name of page, ...
15.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
25......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
25.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
33.....ameritrade.com / (name of page, ...
33.....yahoo.finance / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....goduckgo.com / (name of page, ...
etc.</pre>
<p>If the reason no one's done this is because there's more than one page associated with each PID, that's covered in the listing above. Just list what you know, every one of them. Do you see how powerful that would be, if we knew that PID 15 was shredding the CPU, and we could at least limit it to a limited number of possible criminal pages?
</p><p>I keep numerous windows open and like it or not the reality is that one or more of them are running obscenely rude loops to refresh the page or scan for input or whatever. I have a very well equipped desktop but it is hammered by one or more such sites. I and I am sure others have wasted hours and hours and hours hunting and pecking to diagnose this, and there's NO END to it, because there will continue to be piss poor webpages that suck CPU and disk. Even from <a href=""http://microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">microsoft.com</a>, as you surely know to be often the worst performers of all. I use NoScript but that is not perfect; you have to continuously adjust it for different sites, and you don't know WHICH sites need to be throttled down. It's wildly inefficient when we're shooting in the dark, because we DON'T KNOW WHICH BROWSER WINDOW is the jerkoff.
</p><p>BTW I have many WINDOWS open - almost never tabs. It is almost always massively more efficient than using tabs when you have many. Namely, with windows I can use Windows' own alt-tab, or click or hover the taskbar to navigate.
</p><p>I volunteer a lot of my time, a lot, both in technical areas and in personal charity. I'd do this myself, but I have no browser or HTML development background. Can't someone please come up with something? Asking for the millionth time, please? Sorry I'm getting nasty but there's all this senseless massive waste of time, and it will never go away - unless you heroically answer the call.

This is a very necessary step in my work because of the volume that I print. I've been doing this for YEARS, and it has always worked. Now, suddenly, the PDFs no longer open upon printing from online (printing from desktop apps still works as expected). I have not personally changed any settings in either Firefox or Acrobat DC. But something must be different. Is it a glitch due to a Firefox update? Or could something have changed a setting for me?  
</p><p>As I said, I do a lot of my printing in volume, so this is becoming very frustrating as it means every time I print to PDF from online, I have to leave Firefox and go find the particular folder and make any necessary notations (or even just make sure the PDF created at all, before I dare leave the web site I've just printed from), vs. having the PDF right there in front of me immediately as has always been the case for years in the past.
</p><p>I've already posted to the Adobe forum, and no help has hit the money spot as yet. And, as I said, I've checked all my actual Acrobat settings, and they appear correct (plus, as I said, the PDFs do open automatically when I print from desktop applications).
</p><p>I'd really appreciate some quick help here.   (Btw, I use Windows 10 operating system, 64-bit.)
</p><p>Thanks in advance!

O Outro problema grave é que com a instalação sozinha feita pelo Windows 10, tudo que estava configurado no Firefox (Página Inicial, favoritos, Barra de Menu, Segurança de senha, etc) desaparece. Tenho que configurar o navegador Firefox tudo novamente. 
Por favor, alguém pode me ajudar como resolver e inibir que o Windows faça essas alterações no meu PC?
Geralmente, essas atualizações acontecem quando eu ligo o PC. 
Inclusive, quando eu coloco algum bloqueador, o PC fica sem ligar as vezes, até que seja instalado todas as atualizações que o Windows 10 quer... Eu já pensei que fosse problema com fonte, memória, ou coisa do tipo.. mas não é.
Um absurdo isso que o Windows está fazendo.. Esse navegador edge é muito ruim,,,,

In addition to this there is a subdirectory named /docs for some static documents which are independent from Oracle APEX.
</p><p>Within the Apache virtual host configuration the /docs directory is password-protected using the directives ""AuthType Basic"" and ""AuthName MyDir"" inside a &lt;Directory ...&gt; section - this is working fine so far.
</p><p>However, when being authenticated for the /docs directory, the credentials are also sent when requesting /apex/ or /i/ URLS - thus disturbing the Oracle APEX Authentication (which uses cookies). Doing some monitoring with Wireshark (after switching off SSL temporarily) shows that the credentials for the ""MyDir"" realm are sent in the HTTP header not only for /docs but just for every directory. After clearing the ""Active Logins"" the APEX login works fine again.
</p><p>Tested with FF 60 ESR (as well as with old FF 45.9 ESR).
</p><p>Is there any means to prevent this behaviour, i.e. that users do not have to clear ""Active Logins""?

I got a message that due to changes in Firefox the Firefox profile cannot be used anymore. Then I copied the profile folder manually and checked profiles.ini, but no way. I found an Firefox help article how to copy several files manually to the new profile (""Recovering important data from an old profile""). This seems to be a workaround, but I'm not sure if it restores the Firefox profile completely, and it is unexpected additional work to complete the Windows Restore. 
So my questions: 
Is there an easier way to get the restored Firefox profile running? Firefox synchronization is not allowed due to company policies. 
What is the technical reason for not accepting copied profiles anymore? BTW, there is still an article in the Firefox help recommending this: Back up and restore information in Firefox profiles

Instead it prints the first, last, and sometimes one middle page.  The print preview function suffers the same error.  Since the problem shows up in print preview I don't believe that it is related to the configuration of a specific printer.  It doesn't seem to be a coding error in the web page as other browsers like IE, Chrome, and Opera render the page accurately.  Because I don't print pages often, I can't tell with what version the problem showed up.

Each add on when it is updated forces it's own new tab into foreground, disturbing my current work, possibly causing time sensitive entries to be lost.  The problem is worse on the smaller system due to delays as add ons update and new tab opens. These get in my way and interfere with my business. Chrome is just as bad with this. Make these add ons better behaved. Show an indicator on the three bar menu icon, which already shows permission changes. I will get to it when free.  I want to choose when to view update info, and would be happy with a short update message with links to more info. Also would like to designate time of day or weekday that<strong>bold text</strong> Add Ons are allowed to update. Or have just one tab opened in the background where all such update messages appear. Also, as add-ons come in via Sync, do not default to adding to tool bar. That shrinks my URL text box at inopportune times. Again, put it on the Overflow and I'll put it on a toolbar when and where I prefer.

</p><p>So, what I'm wondering is are there any other older backup files saved anywhere in the FF folders that could be used instead? I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups.

I have not closed FF after relaunching the first time after the crash in order not to create any more blank backups.

</p><p>Firefox 70 on a Fedora 30/31 KDE machine will freeze the entire machine within minutes (sometimes seconds) of launch.  A hard reboot is usually the only way to reset.  The issue is not associated with any particular URL.
</p><p>The System: 
</p><p>Operating System: Fedora 31 /
KDE Plasma Version: 5.16.5 /
KDE Frameworks Version: 5.61.0 /
Qt Version: 5.12.5 /
Kernel Version: 5.3.7-301.fc31.x86_64 /
OS Type: 64-bit /
Processors: 4 × Intel® Core™ i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz /
Memory: 7.7 GiB of RAM
</p><p>When It Started: 
</p><p>The problem began as soon as Firefox was updated to version 70 on the Fedora 30 installation.  I then upgraded Fedora itself to 31, but the Firefox problem persisted.
</p><p>What I have tried:
</p><p>1. I created a brand new user on the system and ran Firefox from that account.  Problem still exists.
</p><p>2. I launched Firefox from the command line in safe mode. Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ firefox -safe-mode
</pre>
<p>3. I launched Firefox with Wayland.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
</pre>
<p>4. I launched Firefox with X11.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-x11
</pre>
<p><br>
Something odd:
</p><p>The user agent string being presented by Firefox is inaccurate.  It is presenting itself as 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
</p><p>And yet this is definitely FF70 on Fedora, as I can attest to, unless I have gone insane and am not realizing it yet.   It particularly troubles me that I have to post this support request from a different browser (so disregard the auto-detected user agent associated with this post).  Oh, the humanity!

This functionality works fine on FireFox itself (Menus, bookmark bar, tab bars etc) but moving to the webpages displayed nothing happens.

In the attachments you can see in FF it works on the bookmark ""most visited"" and in Safari the text boxed in red is part of the page, I was trying to do that on the first attachemnt in FF but you can see there is no text magnification on the page itself.

I hope someone can help!  I've tried everything.
</p><p>I’m using a desktop; Dell; newer. Windows 10; 1903; plenty of speed and space left.
No viruses, etc.; have done many scans (malwarebytes, adware, etc.) 
</p><p>For whatever reason (I think I incorrectly shut down Firefox and/or my computer, and that was the beginning of the problem), Firefox is causing lot of issues.
</p><p>Won’t open or close. followed all the advice on this site.
</p><p>Found out on this site to try ending Firefox in task manager; when that didn’t work; went in to and deleted parent.lock from the profile.
</p><p>Then rebooted the computer; still wouldn’t open (or did once, but then had the same problem?)
Tried shutting off the computer and restarting rather than rebooting many times during all this process as well.
</p><p>I followed what someone said about adding the word OLD after places.sqlite.
So in the original profile folder I have:
</p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD
    places.sqlite-shmOLD
    places.sqlite-walOLD
</pre>
<p>that didn’t help things.
Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’
</p><p>So I have:
</p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD
      prefs-1jsOLD
      prefs-2.jsOLD
      prefs-3.jsOLD
                  Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them
</pre>
<p>That didn’t help.
</p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop.
Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it.
</p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’).
</p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile. 
Same issues.
Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again.
Rebooted.
</p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open).
</p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox).
I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; …..
</p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile!
</p><p>The ‘default-release’ profile and the brand new one I created were never changed or touched; never added the word OLD to anything in there; made no changes.
</p><p>So Firefox wouldn’t close; so I had to do all of the above again (try to end task in task manager; delete parent.lock, and reboot).
</p><p>So now I’m at my wits end!!!
</p><p>I can’t find anything left to try.  : (

(Note, the same CSS works perfectly in Waterfox Classic, using Classic Theme Restorer, Custom CSS Code, for both history and bookmarks, where the different sidebars can be selected from buttons, instead of only from a dropdown in the FF68.)
</p><p>EDIT: PLEASE NOTE, after posting, the CSS is not formatted correctly. Not seeing any way to format as code, nor do I see any other formatting options for this original post. Several of the number/hash signs (#) are replaced by 1, which is not correct. Other formatting issues as well. PLEASE SEE SCREENSHOT OF CORRECTLY FORMATTED CSS:

<p>With the history sidebar selected the appearance this CSS produces is black text on light grey background, which is quite readable and not distracting.

</p><p>But with the bookmarks sidebar selected, the same CSS creates an anemic white text on dark grey background.

</p><p>Wondering what edits or additions I can make to the above CSS to allow the FF68 bookmarks sidebar to have the same appearance. (Or possibly needs completely re-written CSS?) Since it works perfectly for both bookmarks and history in Waterfox, could it be the issue is with how the current FF CSS doesn't take into account the way the bookmarks sidebar is selected only from a dropdown?

a. saving the new firefox loader to my computer

c. Deleting the Mozilla ""upkeep"" files. (I can't actually remember the name of this folder)
d. fixing broken links in the registry.
e. reloading Firefox.

</p><p>- Vírusirtó tűzfalát már kikapcsoltam, de semmi.
</p><p>- Router beállításait már megnéztem, de semmi. Másik böngésző ugyan azon a gépen jól működik.
</p><p>- Proxy beállítások ellenőrzése. Nem is használok, de próbáltam az automatikus proxyt és proxy nélkül is. Semmi.
</p><p>- IPv6 kikapcsolása, de semmi.
</p><p>- DNS Prefetching kikapcsolása.
</p><p>- Sütik és az összes előzmény törlése. Ez csak 1-2 napig segített. Utána megint nem töltődik be bizonyos oldal.
</p><p>- Új profil létrehozása. Ez is működött. Ez kb 1-2 hétig. Utána semmi.
</p><p>- Kiegészítő szerintem nem okozhatja. Összesen csak 2 van telepítve.
</p><p>- Bizonyos leírások szerint a Cert8 és Cert9 fájlok törlése segít. Ez szintén csak 1-2 napig segít. Utána megint semmi.

Lécci segítsetek. Nincs több ötletem és nem szeretnék böngészőt váltani. Jó a firefox!

One is a color printer (Brother) and another is a B&amp;W laser printer (Brother). I can print web pages using either one when I use the Microsoft Edge browser. I can only print web pages using the color printer when using Firefox. When I send web pages to the B&amp;W printer I get an error on the printer machine. I can't identify the error - only that the green light turns red and I must reset the machine to have it print. The web page is not held in the machine's memory, otherwise it would print out when I reset the machine. 
</p><p>I've tried both printer fixes suggested in these Forums (Reset Firefox printer setting and Reset all Firefox printer settings) and neither one fixed this problem.

The color print uses a Wi-Fi connection to my computer and the B&amp;W printer uses a corded USB port.

</p><p>Since release of the Firefox 70 I noticed that all FTP content opened via direct links is being saved right away, instead of being displayed. As I understand, this was done to close this ""bug"": <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699</a>. Though I guess this change can be beneficial for most users, it's also causing unnecessary problem to me a my colleagues at work.
</p><p>We are technical support team and we are working in the ticketing  system called BMC Remedy. All file attachments sent by our customers are uploaded to our internal FTP server and then linked to the tickets via direct FTP links. Before release of the 70th version it was very convenient for us to click on those files, and get files opened straight inside browser. It worked flawlessly, especially for image and text files and saved us a lot of time. It was also the main reason we used Firefox, since in Chrome always (at least recently) saved files instead of displaying them.
</p><p>But the release of 70th version messed up everything for us, and now all the files need to be saved before they can be opened which causes a lot of inconvenience. So much so, we had to downgrade back to 69th version to work normally.
</p><p>As I said at the beginning, I do understand the reason behind this change since FTP vulnerabilities can harm users on public websites. However, inside closed environments like intranets there is no such threats, and losing ability to quickly preview FTP resources can hurt productivity. So in my opinion, while it's a good idea to have this behavior enabled by default, there should be an option under about:config to enable rendering of the FTP resources back. Or maybe someone at least can make an extension or Greasemonkey script that would bring this functionality back.
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is correct place, but I don't know where else to post this to bring attention to this problem.

It's my computer, it's my browser, and I don't like being forced to do what someone else has decided I should do just because they thought it would be a good idea. If I can't find a way to turn off auto updates then I'll abandon Firefox for something more user-friendly.

FF is slow on startup, doesn't matter what OS or what hardware configuration.
I have two laptops it acts the same on both, I've installed it to client's laptops it does same exact thing, so this is a global issue for all Firefox users.

With extensions installed, Firefox starts up and loads <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> sloooooooooooowwwww, compared to Chromium.

What extensions??? Let's keep it basic.. Same exact extensions I use on Chromium. uBlock Origin. 
...
I did report this issue back in the day and advice I got turn off extensions. Come on gents, turning off extensions is not an option, especially when there is a good browser like Chromium that loads blazingly fast with all the same extensions.

Ich habe mir eine UserChrome.css gemacht, die gut funktioniert hat, dann kam Firefox 57? und die Anpassbarkeit war Geschichte.
Wer mit mehreren Tabs arbeitet und dafür sind die Tabs doch da, muss die Maus mehr bewegen und es ist unübersichtlich. Wäre es nicht sinnvoll, dass was ich am häufigsten benutze, in der Nähe der Arbeitsfläche zu haben? Wäre es nicht besser die Tab Leiste standardmäßig nach unten zu legen und wer es anders möchte, der kann sich alle 10 oder 15 Versionen, eine UserChrome.css basteln.

This LIVE DVD crashes or drops out from time to time so each time this happens I have to re-sync the Firefox it brings up.  This re-sync requires a verification code to be sent by email, but because that email has to go through my Google filtering process,  it usually takes longer than the code's 5 minute validity before I  receive it.   When I do finally get it and enter the received code back in Firefox,  I'm told the code is invalid or expired.   This is because 5 minutes validity is just too short a  time for my setup.  If it were 10 minutes, that would allow me to go into Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt;  Accounts &amp; Import -&gt; Check email from other accounts -&gt; and then order Gmail to perform a special immediate mailcheck on my selected account.   
As a slow elderly old codger myself,  I find it too hard to do all this within 5 minutes.  Why can't we make it 10 mins?

I find my access to Facebook content is completely blocked, whereas all other websites appear to be fine. Screenshot from one of the Facebook groups I follow is attached. I have spent hours trying to figure out your new security settings to enable access to Facebook, including switching off all blocking, and nothing is working, except to abandon Firefox and use Microsoft Edge (which is giving me perfect access). Also very ironically I have to use Microsoft Edge to log into Firefox support as Firefox tells me my cookies aren't enabled...except they are. I have been checking out Permissions to ensure everything is correctly enabled and I notice Load Images keeps reverting to Default rather than Enable – I don’t know if this is significant. At any rate Facebook images and data are not loading and it is clear all the pages are being blocked. I also wonder why my Avast online security is not being recognised by Firefox at the moment. I have been happy to use Firefox as my default browser for at least the last 10 years, but this is ridiculous, and I hope there is a simple solution to these issues or I will be changing to a different browser.

Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before.

At some point in the past few years, this setting disappeared from the up-front user option pages (but might still be around in some deeper, less-obvious setting as I have an older machine which still seems to honor its limit set long ago).
</p><p>Since I routinely have to purge the webpage cache in order to regain responsiveness and function of FF when my regular tabs remain open for most of the day, I would like to see this setting return to the user-option front pages -- or know where it is located in some deeper option page.
</p><p>More to the point, though, I would really like FF to constrain itself by design from bloating out on webpage cache -- reminds me too much of the 'memory leakage' problem which came to plague the Opera browser that I finally abandoned 10+ years ago for FF.  I realize that many website developers these days are enamored with the bells, whistles and flashy graphics needed to gain eyeballs and earn something from clicks and click-throughs, but the present-day notion of some endless user supply of RAM grates quite hard with someone of my vintage and experience with computers since the late 1960s.

For instance until earlier today I could load Facebook with no problem, but now only the top blue menu bar will load; the rest of the page is blank white. Oftentimes this has happended with certain other sites; for instance I've not had full functionality on Vimeo or the New York Times' sites for a while. Until recently when I've had this issue with Facebook I've been able to clear the cache and re-load and that has been working, but today I tried this and now that solution doesn't work.
</p><p>2) Certain buttons don't function, such as video playback buttons on The Guardian's site, or certain playback and navigation buttons on Netflix. 
</p><p>3) I tired to log into my Firefox account and got the warning message ""Cookies and local storage are required. Please enable cookies and local storage in your browser to access Firefox Accounts. Doing so will enable functionality such as remembering you between sessions."" Cookies *are* enabled, however, and nothing seems to turn them back on. I've even tried trashing the cookies.sqlite file and re-starting, it doesn't help.
</p><p>I'm tempted to trash the whole install and start from scratch (I've been upgrading from one to the next for over ten years now), but I have thousands of bookmarks I want to preserve, plus many passwords, and now I cannot even log into my Firefox account on the  browser itself due to the erroneous ""cookies"" error massage to confirm that all my passwords are safely backed up.

As soon as I tried to cancel it, a login popup kept appearing and all my open tabs immediately went haywire trying to do some kind of redirect, and I it would not let me click on anything. I quickly ended the process to force close the browser, restarted Firefox and cleared my cache and uninstalled the extension. I am concerned about what kind of malware this may have installed on my machine. 
I reported this user over a month ago, but it is still available on the add-on page, and other people also commented about it having malware.
Any suggestions?

I downloaded a newer version and upgraded manually a couple times, now up to 70.0, and the pop-up keeps happening.  I see a couple other people have reported a similar problem, one here was blown off because they were, supposedly, running a beta version.  I'm not running beta.  The other one I found was fixed by doing something to the registry, but I'm on Linux, not MS Windows so there's no registry (at least none that I know about).
</p><p>The one other symptom I've noticed is that when I bring up the ""About Firefox"" window, it takes a really long time to figure out that ""Firefox is up to date"".  And it always says it's up to date (if I wait long enough) even when there's a newer version available.
</p><p>It would be greatly helpful if that pop-up would say *why* it couldn't update itself but it does not give any useful information.

</p><p><br>
I have stumbled upon a weird issue and can't seem to solve it - some of the pages I visit seem to be blurry and lack sharpness in general. You can see it all on screenshots attached. This happens in different places, using gmail just as an example. I am currently typing this in a tab next to that gmail one, text and images here are in perfectly good shape. 
</p><p><br>
What I have already done:
</p><p>- forced my NVidia GPU to work with Firefox since I intially suspected that it might be an integrated Intel GPU that is causing this (I might've done something wrong so if you suspect this might be it - please elaborate on how I could address this);
</p><p>- double-checked font settings, zoom - all seems to be fine;
</p><p>- reset ClearText settings;
</p><p>- checked if this presists on an external monitor - it does.
</p><p><br>
I am not claiming this just started happening after the last update: I haven't used Firefox for some good time and am now considering switching back. Version is included on screenshots just for reference. I am currently on 70.0 (64-bit). 
</p><p><br>
Any input would be immensly appreciated!
</p><p><br>
Thanks in advance.

The loading icon on the tab will move, but there is no network activity indicated at the bottom of the window nor in the Network Monitor (ctrl+shift+e) until after a few seconds.  Once this delay period has passed, all pages load as normal.  It does this every time, without fail, even in safe mode.  I am using the 64-bit version but also had a 32-bit version still installed, so I decided to launch that version instead, since it still uses my profile and so everything should otherwise be the same.  This version did not have the delay.  I was able to load a webpage immediately.  I have deleted this 32-bit version, thinking it may be interfering somehow (perhaps because using the same profile? idk), but it changed nothing.  I can't imagine how the 64-bit version would perform worse than the 32-bit, so I don't just assume switch over.  I'd like to continue with the 64-bit version, as I have sufficient RAM to make use of it.  I've tried a good handful of solutions, but nothing.  Any ideas?

Every time I go to my online intuit account I have to manually enter the log in info because I accidentally declined to have Firefox save the login info when it asked me.  I looked in Firefox Preferences&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Logins and Passwords and finally in Exceptions &amp; Logins.  It's not in either of those places.  It shows logins that I DO have but it doesn't tell me how to add logins for websites that I declined saving them in the past.  When I go to the website Firefox won't ask me anymore if I want to save the login... AAHH!  Help please?

What I don't understand is when I right click over the new Firefox icon (after the reinstall) and look at the properties, instead of pointing to the folder ...Mozilla/Firefox.exe, it's pointing to ....OldFirefox/Firefox.exe.  It's as if the install didn't create a new Mozilla folder in the directory, even though it was supposed to during the install.
Is there a way to get back what I lost?  I feel like I'm going to throw up right now.  I had an enormous amount of things bookmarked and saved.  Thanks for any help.

I tried to do that earlier today, and the dialogue box that normally opens when I chose ""Filter..."" did not appear.  I tried it with several emails - still no dialogue box.  I then opened Google Chrome (see attached image), went to the same email in my Gmail client, and the feature worked.  I suspect that the issue with using the feature in Firefox is that I upgraded to macOS 10.15 Catalina last night.  I am using Firefox 70.0 for my browser as I prefer many of its features over what I have in Chrome or Safari.  Please let me know if you are aware of this issue, or whether I am an outlier, having a one-off problem.

Well, actually this feature is also long gone from the main Firefox release, but it was still available in ESR version. Now, with the latest ESR version, it's gone too. It's impossible for me to understand why that happened, and frankly, i don't really care. There are no possible arguments which would make any sense.

</p><p>Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search.

Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.
</p><p>I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. 
</p><p>It is not in the Control Panel. 
It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder.  
Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.
I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. 
It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.

1271268,2019-10-24 03:20:04 -0800,2019-10-24T03:20:04Z,Tabs and some extensions blocked if resuming firefox after pc is suspended,"<p>I often leave firefox on with some tabs open and put the pc on suspension mode. Sometimes (not always) when I restart the pc and open firefox some extensions are completely frozen (mainly LastPass) and some tabs as well (usually Youtube or other Google related pages). Cleaning the browser cache never helps.
If I restart firefox in temp mode (extensions disabled) all is good, but when I restart it in normal mode the issue is there again. I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves. 
Any idea what could be causing this? A particular extension? I don't have many installed (I attach a screenshot of my current ones).

So we played that game for a while and eventually it went through. Then you have to sign  up to numerous things that  you do not want and provide a phone number. This is all rubbish. I could find no way of just having the Firefox browser and had to go back to my old version. Why on earth do companies feel that you want your world dominated by their products? It's just a browser that I like, but I am not happy with the lack of clarity and ability to just have the browser without being browbeaten!

Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.
</p><p>Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.
</p><p>In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.
</p><p>Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.
</p><p>Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.
</p><p>Many Thanks.
</p><p>P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means.

</p><p>Well it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. 
</p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. 
</p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. 
</p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!
</p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.

With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. 
</p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again?
</p><p>I am using firefox 68.0. I upgraded from firefox 57.0 over this past summer, and I did not have this issue with top hat and location services prior to upgrading.

This generally works very well.
</p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.

</p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.
</p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.

</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.

I changed my primary email address at a time, when Firefox Sync did not support changing email addresses.
I now checked to see if changing email addresses was possible and indeed, you can now add a secondary email address and switch it to be the primary one. So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".
I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.
</p><p>Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?
</p><p>If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?

The developers of sites that use flash. So why am I being punished? Why do I need to click 3 times additionally for something I have exactly zero, zip, null, no influence over whatsoever? Speaking about user friendliness, this is NOT it. 
Apart from downgrading or reverting to another browser that has not implemented this ridiculous anti-user-friendiness measure, what can I do?

A few days ago I downloaded Firefox Developer Edition and I use it with the same sync email address, because of bookmarks, passwords and more.
But I don't want to use add-ons in Firefox Developer Edition... 
How can I disable add-ons in developer edition, while add-ons stays enabled in Firefox version?
If I use command-line ""-safe-mode"", I get every time a message about safe-mode before Firefox Developer Edition starts.
