I followed the advice given on this support page by renaming the folder ""OldFirefox"" and then reinstalling Firefox, but everything has been lost (or at least seems to be).  What I don't understand is when I right click over the new Firefox icon (after the reinstall) and look at the properties, instead of pointing to the folder ...Mozilla/Firefox.exe, it's pointing to ....OldFirefox/Firefox.exe.  It's as if the install didn't create a new Mozilla folder in the directory, even though it was supposed to during the install.
Is there a way to get back what I lost?  I feel like I'm going to throw up right now.  I had an enormous amount of things bookmarked and saved.  Thanks for any help.

FF 70.0 (64 bit)
</p><p>Let me preface this with saying I worked in IT for a long time. I'm stumped on this one.
</p><p>FF worked fine on 10/22/19. Tried opening FF on 10/23/19 and it kept crashing. I started the task of finding out why. 
</p><p>Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search. It wasn't there the last time I reviewed addons (which I do frequently, trying to find the best addon's for my usage) and I hadn't installed anything new recently. Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.
</p><p>I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. 
</p><p>It is not in the Control Panel. 
It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder.  
Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.
I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. 
It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.
</p><p>How do I get this removed? I don't want it to somehow become enabled in my system.

If I restart firefox in temp mode (extensions disabled) all is good, but when I restart it in normal mode the issue is there again. I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves.

Since a recent update, I can no longer log in to various web sites.  The exact problem differs from site to site but ultimately Firefox just doesn't want to log in to sites.

Ebay: clicked ""Sign In"" button, entered username but Continue button remains greyed out.
YouTube: clicking Sign In button does nothing.
Hotmail: I can enter my username, then on the next page enter my password, but the next page is just the blue Outlook envelope.
I have cleared the cache and restarted Firefox several times.

Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.
</p><p>Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.
</p><p>In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.
</p><p>Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.
</p><p>Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.
</p><p>Many Thanks.
</p><p>P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means.

</p><p>Well it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. 
</p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. 
</p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. 
</p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!
</p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.

With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. 
</p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again?
</p><p>I am using firefox 68.0. I upgraded from firefox 57.0 over this past summer, and I did not have this issue with top hat and location services prior to upgrading.

For a long time i was laging after the world, because i simply don't like current firefox user interface, even though i was using this browser since 1.0 version. However i was always somehow able to customize it the way i wanted. Few years ago it become imposible  when support for clasic theme restorer addon was droped and i was using esr releases ever since with some userchrome.css tweaks. But today update to version 68.2 broke everything i liked about the browser and things rearanged the way i hate. 
i am not dumb , i did try to get it back the way i wanted, but i got stuck on url bar placement, which is now imposible to move out of the navi toolbar.
For most of the work i have used <a href=""https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx</a> code, for user chrome customization , but even they don't have options for url bar to be undocked, moved or removed.
i was also trying to edit About:config toolbars order but after moving urlbar to different toolbar , for instance bookmarks or tabs string autocorect after restart and url bar is forced back on top.
is there any way to make navigation toolbat in 2 rows or move adres bar someplace else?

This generally works very well.
</p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.  I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.
</p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.
</p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.
</p><p>I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.
</p><p>Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile?

</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.

I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.

Going through Settings, Defaults, Firefox is not an option, the icon is not there.  The main issue is Thunderbird now opens messages in IE all of a sudden instead of Firefox.  In Firefox Options, I click on set default and it comes up with IE or search store for an app.    I'd be grateful for any help.
