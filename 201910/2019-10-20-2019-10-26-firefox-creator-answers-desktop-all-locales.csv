I find my access to Facebook content is completely blocked, whereas all other websites appear to be fine. Screenshot from one of the Facebook groups I follow is attached. I have spent hours trying to figure out your new security settings to enable access to Facebook, including switching off all blocking, and nothing is working, except to abandon Firefox and use Microsoft Edge (which is giving me perfect access). Also very ironically I have to use Microsoft Edge to log into Firefox support as Firefox tells me my cookies aren't enabled...except they are. I have been checking out Permissions to ensure everything is correctly enabled and I notice Load Images keeps reverting to Default rather than Enable – I don’t know if this is significant. At any rate Facebook images and data are not loading and it is clear all the pages are being blocked. I also wonder why my Avast online security is not being recognised by Firefox at the moment. I have been happy to use Firefox as my default browser for at least the last 10 years, but this is ridiculous, and I hope there is a simple solution to these issues or I will be changing to a different browser.

It's sluggish and its cursor focus behavior is enervating. I click a field and start typing, then Gmail, with its (or my computer's, or browser's) slowness takes a second or two to apply focus to its desired field, so it starts inputting my typing in the wrong field or worse, interpreting my inputs as actions (archiving, deleting, starring, muting conversations, opening chats, opening Google Tasks sidebar, deleting open draft, etc., really freaking messy). Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before.
</p><p>How can I prevent sites (or at least Gmail, specifically) from controlling/changing cursor focus? Is there an about:config key or an add-on for this, please?
</p><p>BTW, I don't mind Gmail and/or Firefox being a bit slow, I recognize I contribute to it by have a few add-ons installed and running (though not so many). What I don't want is Gmail choosing for me where my typing input is going.

There are pages that are only available in zh-HK. I would like to use my preferred fonts (as in other locales such as zh-TW) but this creates mojibake on the page.
How could I solve this problem?

I have to keep backing out or closing out of Firefox. Initially FF blocked them, but not anymore. Norton never blocked them.
</p><p>These messages only come up when using one FF profile, not another. They also do not show up when using a Chromebook, so I presume the problem is on my end.
</p><p>I have cleared all cookies &amp; cache and did a complete scan with Norton, Malwarebytes, &amp; AdwCleaner. Even restored Windows 7 back to an earlier time. But none of this helped.
</p><p>They are full page messages &amp; say they're from AT&amp;T, Walmart, or Visa. However the addresses all start out with:
<a href=""http://happy.luckyparkclub.com/………"" rel=""nofollow"">happy.luckyparkclub.com/………</a>..
</p><p>Sometimes the messages appears right away &amp; sometimes it takes a few minutes.
</p><p>I cleared FF cookies, went back to the forum, &amp; then looked at the cookies again. I noticed that <a href=""http://happy.luckyparkclub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">happy.luckyparkclub.com</a> and dbmtrk.xyz both appeared in the cookies list at the same time, 23 seconds. The forum cookie was time stamped at 22 seconds.
</p><p>If I look at the forum using a different FF profile there is no problem &amp; neither of these 2 cookies are there.
</p><p>If I open a New Private Window in the problem profile then I don't get the messages either, at least not yet.
</p><p>What does the Private Window NOT access that the regular window does?
</p><p>Which profile folder or file could be causing the problem?
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions.

Now I got a second laptop for work. I want to be able to send tabs from one laptop to the other via the ""send tab"" feature. So I obviously have to log into Firefox sync. But I DON'T want to have all my bookmarks, settings, history and especially extensions synced on my work laptop. Since I want to have a different set of bookmarks on my work laptop (related to work) I need to turn off the syncing of the bookmarks (unfortunately I don't  think it's possible to sync two different sets of bookmarks). Same goes for the extensions, settings and history. So long story short, I want to only use the send-tab feature, and to sync opened tabs. 
</p><p>Now here's the problem. When I log into Firefox sync after a fresh install on my work laptop and I enter my credentials, you are not asked what to sync. The default is to sync everything. After that everything is synced right away within a few seconds, and by the time I went to settings to turn the syncing of bookmarks, extensions etc. off, the bookmarks already synced and a ton of extensions start to appear. And probably all my settings that I don't want on my work laptop are synced, too. 
</p><p>Is there a way to choose what to sync BEFORE the syncing starts? That would actually be pretty smart...

</p><p>I'm experiencing multiple issues on Firefox and I'm wondering if these can be fixed, or I'm I'm better off re-installing. To wit:
</p><p>1) Certain sites have stopped loading properly. For instance until earlier today I could load Facebook with no problem, but now only the top blue menu bar will load; the rest of the page is blank white. Oftentimes this has happended with certain other sites; for instance I've not had full functionality on Vimeo or the New York Times' sites for a while. Until recently when I've had this issue with Facebook I've been able to clear the cache and re-load and that has been working, but today I tried this and now that solution doesn't work.
</p><p>2) Certain buttons don't function, such as video playback buttons on The Guardian's site, or certain playback and navigation buttons on Netflix. 
</p><p>3) I tired to log into my Firefox account and got the warning message ""Cookies and local storage are required. Please enable cookies and local storage in your browser to access Firefox Accounts. Doing so will enable functionality such as remembering you between sessions."" Cookies *are* enabled, however, and nothing seems to turn them back on. I've even tried trashing the cookies.sqlite file and re-starting, it doesn't help.
</p><p>I'm tempted to trash the whole install and start from scratch (I've been upgrading from one to the next for over ten years now), but I have thousands of bookmarks I want to preserve, plus many passwords, and now I cannot even log into my Firefox account on the  browser itself due to the erroneous ""cookies"" error massage to confirm that all my passwords are safely backed up. I've tried re-starting in safe mode with all plug-in disabled, and that did nothing to solve my problems.

All it did was open a video conversion website, which worked for the first video I tried (with alot of popups) but the second video I tried, it redirected me to a fake Firefox update page. 
As soon as I tried to cancel it, a login popup kept appearing and all my open tabs immediately went haywire trying to do some kind of redirect, and I it would not let me click on anything. I quickly ended the process to force close the browser, restarted Firefox and cleared my cache and uninstalled the extension. I am concerned about what kind of malware this may have installed on my machine. 
I reported this user over a month ago, but it is still available on the add-on page, and other people also commented about it having malware.

I'd guess 6+ seconds?  The loading icon on the tab will move, but there is no network activity indicated at the bottom of the window nor in the Network Monitor (ctrl+shift+e) until after a few seconds.  Once this delay period has passed, all pages load as normal.  It does this every time, without fail, even in safe mode.  I am using the 64-bit version but also had a 32-bit version still installed, so I decided to launch that version instead, since it still uses my profile and so everything should otherwise be the same.  This version did not have the delay.  I was able to load a webpage immediately.  I have deleted this 32-bit version, thinking it may be interfering somehow (perhaps because using the same profile? idk), but it changed nothing.  I can't imagine how the 64-bit version would perform worse than the 32-bit, so I don't just assume switch over.  I'd like to continue with the 64-bit version, as I have sufficient RAM to make use of it.  I've tried a good handful of solutions, but nothing.  Any ideas?  I've included troubleshooting info, in case that's useful at all.

</p><p>Let me preface this with saying I worked in IT for a long time. I'm stumped on this one.
</p><p>FF worked fine on 10/22/19. Tried opening FF on 10/23/19 and it kept crashing. I started the task of finding out why. 
</p><p>Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search. It wasn't there the last time I reviewed addons (which I do frequently, trying to find the best addon's for my usage) and I hadn't installed anything new recently. Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.
</p><p>I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. 
</p><p>It is not in the Control Panel. 
It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder.  
Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.
I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. 
It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.

If I restart firefox in temp mode (extensions disabled) all is good, but when I restart it in normal mode the issue is there again. I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves. 
Any idea what could be causing this? A particular extension? I don't have many installed (I attach a screenshot of my current ones).

Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.
</p><p>Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.
</p><p>In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.
</p><p>Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.
</p><p>Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.
</p><p>Many Thanks.
</p><p>P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means.

</p><p>Well it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. 
</p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. 
</p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. 
</p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!
</p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.

With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. 
</p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time.

This generally works very well.
</p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.  I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.
</p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.
</p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.
</p><p>I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.
</p><p>Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile?

</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.

I changed my primary email address at a time, when Firefox Sync did not support changing email addresses.
I now checked to see if changing email addresses was possible and indeed, you can now add a secondary email address and switch it to be the primary one. So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".
I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.
</p><p>Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?
</p><p>If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?

As per the title, whenever I open up a page in reader view, there is no narrate button. However, in a new profile, there is said button and it works fine. It is only on my current profile.
</p><p>Methods Tried:
-Toggling 'Prevent accessibility services from accessing your browser'(about:preferences#privacy), narrate.enabled and extensions.pocket.enabled.
-Restarting Firefox with all extensions disabled (via about:profiles).
</p><pre>Additional notes:
</pre>
<p>As I have tried disabling all extensions to no avail, I've concluded that the issue lies with Firefox's configuration, which might have been changed by some extensions or by me (following guide at <a href=""http://privacytools.io"" rel=""nofollow"">privacytools.io</a>).
</p><p>Request:
Can I know of all settings (including about:config) that can cause the narrate function to be disabled? If not, is there anything I can do other than to switch to a new profile or refreshing Firefox? I don't really want to reconfigure everything. Thanks in advance.

Firefox 69 (también ocurre lo mismo con Chrome) genera un problema en el escritorio de Windows 10, y el problema es que se genera un flickering parpadeo muy molesto. Este parpadeo es un error bien conocido, y ya está documentado en Youtube.
El parpadeo ocurre solamente en el escritorio de Windows 10 y no se presenta en las ventanas de otras aplicaciones, afecta solo al escritorio.
Es un parpadeo que muestra cuadrados con bloques que parpadean constantamente, pero siempre, en el escritorio de Windows 10 y no en las ventanas de otras aplicaciones.
Este parpadeo ocurre cuando se está usando Firefox y se producen ventanas emergentes, al ocurrir esto, se empieza a producir el parpadeo.
No es un defecto de drivers, ya que si así fuera ocurriría en toda la pantalla y con todas las aplicaciones, y no solo en el escritorio de Windows 10.
Deshabilitar la aceleración por Hardware no soluciona el problema.
Este problema se produce cuando se utiliza Firefox y cuando salen ventanas emergentes, pero, cuando Windows 10 está configurado en modo PRESENTACIÓN (es decir, para que el fondo de pantalla de Windows cambie automáticamente a otro nuevo, cada X minutos). Si Windows 10 está configurado en modo Imagen, para que ponga una imagen fija en el escritorio como fondo de pantalla, entonces el flickering no se presenta al usar Firefox.
Desactivar el modo PRESENTACIÓN es lo único que resuelve el problema, pero con la limitación de tenerte que aguantar con el mismo fondo de pantalla sin que Windows lo cambie.
El problema no se presenta porque sea algo de Windows, el problema se presenta si se usa Firefox y Windows está configurado para cambiar el fondo de pantalla con el modo presentación.
Si uso Edge y tengo configurado Windows 10 en modo presentación, entonces los fondos de pantalla cambian y no pasa nada, incluso si salen ventanas emergentes.
¿Cuando podrá solucionarse este problema tan molesto?
Lo raro es que pasa con Firefox y con Chrome, pero no pasa con Edge de Microsoft.
¿Alguien sabe por qué pasa y como solucionarlo permitiendo que Windows me pueda cambiar los fondos de pantalla?
Saludos
