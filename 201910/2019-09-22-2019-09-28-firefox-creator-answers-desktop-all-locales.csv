1269734,2019-09-28 23:50:38 UTC,2019-09-29T00:22:04Z,"Lost Facebook on 9-17-19 on my Windows 10, Dell laptop. All I got was a blank page. No blue header, no search box, no profile name, no home, no notifications, n","<p>Lost Facebook on 9-17-19 on my Windows 10, Dell laptop. All I got was a blank page. No blue header, no search box, no profile name, no home, no notifications, nothing, a totally blank page. Just <a href=""https://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com</a> in the address bar with the green padlock. If I click on another person’s FB link, I get ""Sorry, something went wrong"" ""we are working on getting this fixed as soon as we can. Go Back or help.”  
Clue #1 The Firefox browser my FB was bookmarked on, started messaging that it was NOT my default browser. (it WAS; before the problem) When I tried to make it my default, Firefox was NOT on the list. Thought I may have a virus. From IE I downloaded and ran Microsoft Safety Scanner - zero infections.
Clue #2 Other browsers (IE, Edge) on this computer, that had my FB bookmarked cannot excess any FB pages.  All other non-Facebook bookmarks work as normal.  One Chrome browser that only had my wife’s FB page bookmarked on it, was not affected (all her bookmarked FB pages are still accessible as before.) I can even see my FB page with it and can message to it. Another home computer (Windows 8.1) has the exact same problem – all browsers with my FB page bookmarked are blocked from getting to any other FB page. The Chrome browser with only my wife’s FB page bookmarked is not affected.  
Clue #3 After two days I uninstalled my Firefox browser and downloaded a new Firefox browser. Firefox wanted me to sign up for an account.  I used the same email address for this new account as I had for my Facebook sign in account. I was unable to create the Firefox account, got ""500 Error Oh dear, something went wrong there. We've been notified and will get working on a fix."" And tried to verify this account via the same email and I got “Verification error (loading Chunk 23 failed)” Later I was able to create the new account and verify it by using an email other than the one for signing into Facebook. (My wife’s FB sign in email account is NOT the same email provider as mine.) 
Clue #4 Found my Facebook page. I searched for it using my name and “Facebook,” it was at: <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/(my"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.facebook.com/(my</a> name)?refid=7.  Bookmarked it on my new Firefox browser. Researching M.Facebook , I get: “<a href=""http://m.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">m.facebook.com</a> is styleless version of the site with limited capabilities. It is intended for those with older phones and less powerful mobile browsers. It allows just viewing your feed and commenting on posts.” It only uses the center part of my computer screen. I didn’t have to sign into it. I can message my wife and she can message back. I can see my friends list and comment on their posts.  See screenshot of m.facebook. Note: a couple hours before this all started, my Firefox browser was hijacked with a message from Microsoft (see screenshot) I assumed it was malware and deleted it the way I normally do. Right clicked on my task bar&gt;task manager&gt;Firefox&gt;end task.  
Sorry this is so long winded. I thought you needed all these clues to help diagnose my problem.

Have disabled all extensions, and am running ""Standard"" content blocking.
At the same time, have noticed that cut/paste or copy/paste link in ""Show all bookmarks"" also fails.
Learned this when trying to move a folder (!).
Had to restore the last copy of bookmarks to recover the link folder that i was trying to move.
Also, the Font Awesome symbols used on a site like Google Develop are inactive and only display the text associated with the icon.
</p><p>My ""feeling"" is that these are somehow related. My suspicion is that there is a memory management issue somewhere.
</p><p>If not, how to handle the first issue: inability to handle the Google fonts page.
The problem does not occur in Chrome or in Edge.
The problem also does not occur win FF mobile under IOS.

I go, ""Man, that website must be slow!"" and click on the tab. Lo and behold, the tab was pretty much frozen until I clicked on it. It was like it wasn't going to load until I clicked on it. Is there any way I can make this not happen? And have tabs load whether or not I'm in the tab I want to load? It seems sometimes that my computer is just slow, and the tab takes a while to load and happens to load when I click on the tab. Either way, it hasn't happened before, and I don't particularly want it to happen anymore lol.

mám problém s načítáním stránky se hrou. Před pár dny mi odpoledne ještě vše fungovalo a večer se stránka načetla nekorektně. Od té doby nemohu používat Firefox, ale ostatní prohlížeče fungují. Na druhém počítači se stejnými Win7/64b mi stejná verze Firefoxu normálně funguje, takže problém musí být v konkrétním prohlížeči.
Stránka se načte v podivném textovém režimu s obrázky. Jsou na ní stejné informace jako mají být, jen jinak umístěné a cca 1/4 roku staré. Po kliknutí na odkaz proběhne jen refresh této stránky, ale nespustí se hra.
V anonymním okně hra funguje jak má.
Vymazal jsem historii, s tím že jsem zatrhnul vše a vybral i čas vše, vymazal jsem cookies a nic nepomohlo.
Přes nápovědu jsem vyzkoušel spustit firefox v nouzovém režimu bez doplňků, ale ani to nefungovalo.
Řešil jsem problém s podporou hry, ale netuší co může být špatně s konrétním prohlížečem.
Přes Nápověda - technické informace jsem se dostal k profilu, ale složka Temporary je prázdná a nenašel jsem kam se ukládají dočasné soubory abych je zkusil smazat ručně.
Ani na stránkách podpory Firefoxu jsem nenašel odpověď.
Můžete mi poradit co ještě vyzkoušet?
Díky Pavel

Can I create a file that has a name that Firefox update expects, and give that file some content or property so that Firefox update fails?

The problem was switching another account. The same problem obviously through a computer browser (design mode). I understand that the error is Google, but still I believe that the browser must work even with such errors. I also encountered the problem of translating pages. Let's say from English to Russian. I have a google plugin. I think that it would be better if Mozilla had its own plugin and it was better than Google's. I see the pluses in you and I hope that the performance of your browsers will be better than Google and Apple, but when I see such errors, they unfortunately do not give such advantages. And I believe that it is necessary to work on the design of the browser for a greater desire to use and open it. I will be glad if listen to me. Thank you for your product.

I also use the Print Edit WE extension &amp; sometimes it even happens when I use that...

Where this generally solved any webpage data related issues, for now the toggle on the webpage (switch lamp/scene on or off) no longer works. Switching off, next try the status is still trying to switch off. (A manual refresh will show the status is already off). There seems to be an issue receiving the feedback from the server and updating (refreshing, full/partially) the webpage involved.

There is no such tab in the 3-bar menu (attached) that I can see, and neither is there anything that says Options in the Preferences page that I have been able to find. (also attached).
I kind of need to go to Options to make a change to my browser settings, and cannot do so, because there is no Options available to click on.....
Can anyone explain this to me, or direct me to the proper pathway??
Oh yes, and Thanks in advance!!
