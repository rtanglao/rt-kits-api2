due to mediocre internet connection, I always liked the option to buffer all the video (pausing it until it ends) to avoid interruption during the view.
Initially, Firefox was set to allow this.
Around june 2017, one update changed that option, but I was able to set some parameters to still allow the full buffering, following the explanations on that thread:
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/tr/questions/1168957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/tr/questions/1168957</a>
</p><p>Now, it's not working again, and I presume something has changed in a recent update.
Is that one a known issue?
Someone has the same problem?
Is there another way to allowing the buffering by changing some of the parameters?
</p><p>Thanks in advance.

1270099,2019-10-05 10:53:52 UTC,2019-10-06T15:59:49Z,Prevent Firefox from Clearing the Cache Automatically,"<p>Hi all,
</p><p>I'm a photographer and I've been using Firefox as my default/go-to browser for dealing with images-related things like uploading and downloading to server, accessing and opening photography-related sites and accounts such as Flickr Pro. I'd like to know if any of you can help me with my problem with cache.
</p><p>So I've noticed that when using Firefox, oftentimes the cache is being cleared/purged automatically, for reasons I don't know yet. I'd like to know how I can keep the cache, or in other words, prevent Firefox from clearing the cache for any reason whatsoever. I really need the cache and I don't mind keeping a large or even massive cache. I'm browsing the same sites over and over again and I'd like to keep the cache instead of having to download it again everytime I browse the sites with Firefox.
</p><p>The problem is I've tried things like disabling smart cache size and increasing my disk cache to 4 GB to no avail. Firefox always clears the cache automatically after certain period of time or under certain or specific condition(s). The thing is I don't know how to stop Firefox from tampering with my cache. None of my add-ons is actually tampering with the cache, nevermind clearing it.
</p><p><br>
Several settings that I've changed/modified manually:
</p><p>ã» browser.cache.auto_delete_cache_version: set to -1.
</p><p>ã» browser.cache.check_doc_frequency: set to 2.
</p><p>ã» browser.cache.disk.capacity: set to 4096000. 
I read somewhere that a Firefox users and a fellow photographer managed to increase the size to 16 GB with his Firefox 69 and is able to keep his cache until he clears it manually, but I failed to repro his steps since my Firefox always reverted back to 380 MB or something whenever I did that. He's probably using custom userChrome and/or userContent css.
</p><p>All these settings are set to false:
ã» browser.cache.disk.smart_size.enabled 
ã» browser.cache.disk.smart_size.first_run 
ã» browser.cache.disk.smart_size.use_old_max
</p><p>ã» browser.cache.memory.capacity: set to 2048000.
</p><p>ã» media.cache_size: sometimes I set this to 4096000 to see if it helps with anything, but most of the time it is set to its default value (unchanged).
</p><p>ã» browser.tabs.remote.warmup.enabled: set to false.
I might accidentally added this to my 56.0.2 (and set it to false) since I don't remember tab warming being in pre-Quantum, but my 69.0.2 has this and I set it to false. There is also a thing with mouse cursor hovering over a tab making it reload the tab, but only after Firefox clear my cache.
</p><p><br>
If any of you curious about why I'm using 56.0.2, it's because I'm still using Multi Paste and Go add-on, which is a Godsend to me. It's really helpful with accessing or opening several links or images at once, oftentimes more than 30-40 images, and unfortunately the add-on is not made compatible with 69.0.2. I'm a very careful person when it comes to security and I never opened any sites with questionable or suspicious quality, just things related to work (photography) and bills (So-Net Nuro, Softbank, etc.) so please don't worry about my browsing habits or security risks. I also always disable Flash plugin.
</p><p>At this point, I really have no idea how to prevent Firefox from clearing my cache. Sometimes Firefox clears my cache when I am still browsing, sometimes when I leave it idle. Sometimes I can reach over 1 GB of cache size before Firefox clears it, sometimes Firefox clears the cache when the size is still about 100-200 MB.
</p><p>I always perform system maintenance manually (from updating OS to installing drivers, from setting up Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to making backups) so I'd rather clearing my cache manually instead of letting Firefox do that for me.
</p><p>Can any of you help me with my problem with cache?
</p><p>I appreciate and thank for the help, advice, suggestion and assistance you could provide. I don't mind using custom userChrome or userContent as long as you don't mind guiding me with it (I never used it before). 
</p><p>I'm looking forward to get your help and feedback. Thank you very much.

Suddenly this week, when I hit Enter, instead of going to the page, I get a Redirect Notice showing me what page it's about to take me to. I thought it was some Google thing but it doesn't happen on Chrome and from searching it seems it's a Firefox thing.

</p><p>Searching tells me that the setting for this is in about:config under accessibility.blockautorefresh - just set it to false. Great. Except that's the default setting and it's already set for false. Restarting Firefox does not change things.
</p><p>I am using version 60.9.0esr (64-bit) and while it may have automatically downloaded an update earlier this week, it needs to be restarted to install it, and I did not restart Firefox between this not happening and this happening.

I have seen it rarely in the past when clicking an image on Google search results, but not very often - usually I am just taken to the page where the image lives.

Many web pages try to send Email through the default browser; one example is WeatherBug when you click on feedback. When I do that (on Chrome, incidentally), an infinite loop seems to be created with mailto because I don't have Firefox set up to send Email (and don't particularly want to do so). When this occurs, I have to quit or sometimes force quit and reopen Firefox. It would not bother me if a single tab were created with an error message, but many, many tabs are created in that infinite loop. I suspect that this is a bug in the way Firefox processes such mailto requests.

1269949,2019-10-02 23:37:00 UTC,2019-10-03T21:12:44Z,how to get 'save this bookmark' back and how to get a longer list of favorites folders when adding a bookmark,"<p>I seem to have a related problem now, along with my original problem, that prevents me from using Firefox as my default web browser. For some reason now, all of a sudden, the menu option ""save this bookmark"" has disappeared from my list to do so!!!! I have attached a screen shot so you can see what I mean.
My main problem that I find infuriating, is when I want to save a bookmark to my long list of favorites folders (well over 300, not including the sub-folders!!) is that the number of clicks that are needed to just get the list, but once the list is accessible, all I can see is about a list of the top 5 or 6 folders!!! This takes me WAY too long to scroll through my list to find the right folder, and if I have the same named sub-folder, in multiple main folders, how do I know which one I am in, unless I scroll up and down to verify which one of the main folders I am currently in? I still use IE just because theirs is so much easier to use and doesn't take anywhere near as long to add a bookmark, but since it is so old, I keep getting a notice that it is out of date, even if it will display the webpage properly given the changes to how webpages are now programmed and IE no longer gets any updates. Chrome is even worse, given that they constantly want to keep track of you or have you log in to anything of theirs that you use, so I don't use Google.
What I want is a simple button (like what is/was) available in IE that with one click gets me a long list of my folders so that I can see my many many folders to choose from, can scroll through the list as needed to make a selection, WITH all folders and sub-folders visible, select the one I want, and if necessary an option to add a new sub-folder, and then I am done, and it closes (I have added a screen shot of what IEs list looks like and you can see the button on the top left of my favorites menu down the left hand side, to add a new bookmark)
I have counted the number of clicks needed to finish adding a bookmark in Fire fox and in IE and the number difference is ridiculous!! WHY CAN'T THIS BE SIMPLER?????
But now for some reason I can't even add a new bookmark since it is missing, so I guess Firefox no longer wants me to use their software by allowing the option from being removed! How did this happen?!
Everything about Firefox is terrific I find EXCEPT this lack of ability to simple add a bookmark to a favorite folder. This prevents me from making Firefox my go-to browser. I want to switch over, but since you make it too complicated, FORGET IT!!!! If you ever change this to something more suitable, I am all ready to make the switch, but it is seriously lacking.
</p><p>For right now I need to know how to add a bookmark, and, is there any way to tell Firefox to make the list of folders when adding a bookmark longer?

Works on other box.  .CSS issue?","<p>This question has been asked before, tried the solutions.  Adblock disabled, cookies and cache cleared, theme set to default.  About:config options tweaked to defaults.   Specific example: This wikipedia site: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations</a>  has math equations and matrix images, which fail to render.  They appear briefly, then disappear.  Flash plugin disabled.  Perhaps default .CSS files altered?  How to check this?  Note: FF menu: Tools/Page-Info/Media shows equation images fine. Also, can click on blank part of screen where image is, and right-click ""view image"", and math equations/matrix images render ok.  But page show only blank white space.  
Guys, this should not be this hard, here in 2019.  Default .CSS might have been changed in my desperate attempts to change horrible bright-white page to a dark-theme.   FIrefox with super-bright-white page is a bad experience, but blanked-out non-display-of-inline images, of course, makes Firefox sadly useless.  If I can find the solution, I will post it here.   This should *not* be this difficult.  If the image can be rendered with a right-click to view it, the browser should just render that in-line in the page, and not display a blank white space, which it does now.   This is an error that simply should not occur.

I enabled DoH and Firefox documentation states that ""to determine whether to use/bypass the enabled DoH option, Firefox checks amongst other things whether the preference security.enterprise_roots.enabled is set to true. 
This preference is set to true and locked in my browser, and my device is not corporate controlled. Further investigating I found a config file in the /defaults/pref folder that is added by Bitdefender my anti-virus product. Two questions:
With this setting set to True, does that mean that Firefox will ignore the enabled DoH and use my configured resolvers?
How can I prevent my anti-virus product from modifying this setting? I have a support question out to them but they are dragging their feet with their response.

The crash dump from this morning is bp-e9b8e69a-7da7-43db-9f77-60ec60191002 .  I have started a Browser Console so that I will have it the next time the problem recurs.

I spent a significant amount of time trying to move tab and address bar to the bottom of the window including address suggestion popup involved stuff several years ago when Opera was deprecated and pulled out of Gentoo repository completely. My partly working recipe was:
</p><pre>   @namespace ""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keyoligarch/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keyoligarch/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>"";
   @-moz-document url(""chrome://browser/content/browser.xul"") {
       #PopupAutoCompleteRichResult {
           /* bindings.xml in the same folder as userChrome.css */
           -moz-binding: url(""bindings.xml#urlbar-popup"")Â !important;
       }
       #appMenu-popup {
           -moz-binding: url(""bindings.xml#appmenu-popup"")Â !important;
       }
       #navigator-toolbox {
           display: contentsÂ !important;
       }
       #nav-bar {
            -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2Â !important;
       }
       #TabsToolbar {
            -moz-box-ordinal-group: 3Â !important;
       }
   }
</pre>
<p>While this caused slight overlap of address suggestion window/popup over top of address bar, that was pretty annoying, but still acceptable.
Recently, firefox-68.1.0 update rolled in to Gentoo stable repository. That update brought compilation against system libs and caused FF to start with an empty window. After pocking around and messing with plugins, I came to a conclusion, that this is my innocent tweaks that causes FF to start with no windows at all, so I was forced to disable this section and ended up with default layout with address and tab bar at the top of the FF window. Since I have KDE tabs at the top, this make a mess, and make it difficult to figure out whats going on.
</p><p>Since I'm not really good at CSS things, can anybody give me a hand to do the fallowing:
</p><p>1) move tab bar to the most bottom of the window;
</p><p>2) move address bar just above tab bar;
</p><p>3) make address suggestion window/popup roll UP just above address bar
</p><p>4) keep main menu (activated by Alt) stay at top where it is by default.

</p><p>Hope you are all doing well.
</p><p>On a corporate Thinkpad T480 running Windows 10 Version 1803 OS Build 17134.1006 Firefox is crashing daily. Chrome or IE doesn't have the same problem.
Troubleshooting performed so far:
1. Tried running Firefox for a full day in Safe Mode: Still crashes - bp-d9e945ed-e475-4b92-a449-e3b620191002
2. Tried ESR version of Firefox - no improvement.
3. Re-installed Firefox a few times - no improvement.
4. Chrome, IE, Edge do not have the same problem but they are not FirefoxÂ : )
5. Reviewed the Firefox crashes knowledge base and tried everything listed there. Last test was to use Firefox for a day in Safe Mode (wasn't easy but I coped with it)
</p><p>Something i've noticed (not 100% sure about it) is that if I leave a private window open the crash is somehow more likely to occur.
</p><p>So far my observations are that this is some sort of a memory leak-like problem as just before the crash tabs on the browser and some content on pages becomes blank when I hover over with the mouse. Task Manager shows very high Memory usage 1,5-2 GBs.
</p><p>Any and all advises are welcomed. Thank you!
</p><p>Regards,
Dimitar

1269899,2019-10-02 01:52:16 UTC,2019-10-02T12:00:20Z,Bookmarks toolbar randomly rearranges itself,"<p>This issue has been around for years with no actual solution.  I recently finally got around to disconnecting three of my devices (laptop, Samsung tablet and Samsung smartphone) from Firefox Sync in order to determine if the problem is sync-related. The bookmarks toolbar on my main device (another laptop) were still being randomly rearranged. I therefore disconnected this laptop from sync as well. The bookmarks toolbar has since been stable with no rearranging. This is telling me that this is a sync issue, not an issue with a corrupt places.sqlite file, an add-on/plug-in or hardware acceleration, as previously suggested by Mozilla, which was then marked as a solution. Sync has often been quite useful, but since I have my bookmarks (folders) arranged in alphabetical order on the toolbar for quick access and use them all frequently, I'd rather forego sync than deal with constant reordering of the bookmarks toolbar. I gather from what I've read that this problem also exists in the Google Chrome web browser. Even if the problem is a corrupted places.sqlite file, surely the sheer number of users experiencing the issue would suggest a bug or vulnerability with that file, irrespective of what add-ons are installed since the likelihood of all those users having the same add-on(s) installed is probably minimal.  Surely it's about time Mozilla properly investigated (e.g. what add-on(s) is causing the issue, how the places.sqlite file can become corrupted, how sync is causing the problem, etc., etc. and disseminating the findings to users) and actually solved this issue instead of expecting users (the IT-savvy ones at least) to waste time doing their own futile troubleshooting. I really don't think that I should have had to disconnect from sync in order to ""fix"" this problem.

I use smart keywords to go to different subreddits, so for example searching for ""r askreddit"" goes to <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com/r/AskReddit</a>. The issue I have is that if I want to go to the front page, I can't just search for ""r"", as that goes to <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/</a> which then redirects to <a href=""http://reddit.com/subreddits"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com/subreddits</a>.
</p><p>So what I'd want is to have an if-then statement - if there is no other argument following the ""r"", it should go to <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a>. This works with Google Maps and YouTube without needing to do anything /Google handles empty search differently than reddit I suppose/.

You'd think that this browser would wake up and remember what users are inputting.  There are few things more aggravating than being asked the same question over and over.  It is utterly astounding that so many software designers seem to be unable to comprehend this.  I wonder if they are truly living in another dimension.  To think that so much of our lives are controlled by these mindless idiots is so sad.  No wonder so much of our society is so inefficient.  
The problem seems to be centered on calling with Gmail.  Calling with Google Hangouts seems to be fine.  It may be a Flash problem.  Probably as Adobe is such a horrible company, being so intrusive and stubborn in so much of their products.  I guess Google chose them as a lesser of several evils.  The thing is I've gone into Control Panel, Flash Player (though it says its 32 bit and I'm on a 64 bit system) and allowed <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> yet it still doesn't make a difference.  In Firefox Permissions (hey, how come about:permissions no longer works?) I see <a href=""http://Hangouts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Hangouts.google.com</a> is there but <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> is not there even though I've allowed it 100 times.  Why would it not be retained?  That is probably the problem.  And looking at that stupid Permissions page is so aggravating.  Such a total design failure.  You can Remove All Websites, but you can't ADD ANY WEBSITES.  IDIOTS!!!!  If I could, Gmail wouldn't ask me every time I laod or refresh the page.  Just think:  People are actually getting paid, often very well, for moronic work like this.  Boggles the mind.

</p><p>Firstly, I am a very experienced Firefox user of many years. I have had my firefox set up as described above since installation, so it's not some operator error problem. 
</p><p>I'm uploading three screenshots that will spell out my problem in black and white.
</p><p>The specific issue --as shown in the images-- is that immediately after installing firefox 69 all my exceptions no longer function at all.
</p><p>As you can see in the image showing site information ""mail.google"" and ""accounts.google"" are being allowed. This is because I used the right-click method on the site to create a cookie exception via site permissions under the ""View Page Info"", so please ignore those two for the purpose of this discussion.
If you'll notice in the same image, ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" shows as Blocked with a tiny X next to it. As shown in the image of the (archaic) Cookie Exceptions Interface, the very same site ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" is clearly set to ""Allow"". If I click the tiny X next to ""<a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>"" in the Site Information's Cookie section (as shown in Image one) the ""exception"" is removed and it just shows ""Blocked"" as it does in the ""<a href=""http://play.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">play.google.com</a>"" <a href=""http://entry.Re"" rel=""nofollow"">entry.Re</a>-adding the exception to the Exceptions lists restores that tiny X but the cookie remains blocked. I have already covered adding redundancies and variants of each domain such as both HTTP and HTTPS etc. I have noticed, however, that entries like ""<a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>"" which used to cover all possible variations by avoiding the prefix altogether have entirely disappeared. It is my theory that this is part of the problem, but on this I am no expert.
</p><p>In summary, I would like to restore my FF69 to what it was before FF69: with all cookies blocked and a few select cookies allowed through. Drastic actions like refreshing everything to new and that sort of thing I do not believe is the solution. What I am hoping for here is to alert developers so that they can fix it in an upcoming patch.
</p><p>Irrelevant Comments:
I had a terrible time trying to utilize this forum. I try to never make accounts and was forced to do so to post here. Fair enough, but in order to do so I had to use Microsoft Edge (BLECH!) because the site simply would not function on Firefox. This is likely to very strict settings on my end but I must say that many other forums work flawlessly. I find this disappointing.
</p><p><br>
I believe it is time for an entirely new cookie exception interface where entries can be sorted, modified and easily accessed. If you've ever scrolled through 8 zillion exceptions you know what I mean. The Site Preferences interface's cookie &amp; site data entries should be click-able with easy ways to allow or disallow. An advanced mode (with a warning for beginners) allowing more comprehensive exceptions on per cookie basis with features like are available in the browser extension named CookieBro would be absolutely ideal. Firefox seems to be becoming less and less friendly to the advanced user with less and less control over content on a per-site basis. My apologies for including some feedback here, but I can't find anywhere else to send it.
</p><p>Thank you one and all for your time in advance, and any solutions that don't involve catastrophic actions will be greatly appreciated.

I used FF with Tab Mix Plus addon for years, but now WebExtension limited most features. One feature I very liked in Tab Mix Plus was changed tab open and close order. For example:
1. I open google site (on first tab - parent) and mouse click with Ctrl a few links. Several unread tabs open, one by one (e.g. 2 to 5 - childs). 
2. I switch to the third tab. I read content. When I close this tab, Firefox should switch me to first tab again (with google site list in this example) - just to the parent tab again. Instead, without TabMix, Firefox switches to the nearest tab on the right, so I must manually switch to first tab. This is very annoying to me.  
</p><p>In other words - FF upon close one tab, should switch to last visited tab - not nearest tab on the right. 
</p><p>Is there any solution for this?

A long term problem with AOL web email is they change ads constantly, almost each time you move your mouse.  When one of these ads got hung and didn't load, they often hung Firefox too.  That seems to have has been fixed, thankfully.  Now when an AOL ad fails to load (probably a hung script) and it effects Firefox, Firefox will pop up a bright yellow banner at the top that reads, ""A web page is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do?,"" offering the option to either ""Stop It"" or ""Wait.""  Stopping it almost always solves the problem.  The problem I want to report is, if you step away for a while and then this happens, and you are not there to click either option, and then your computer goes to sleep (I have a Mac), when you wake it, it seems to have eaten all your RAM.  Everything crawls.  I've had to wait many minutes just to get enough RAM to try to force quit apps, hoping to kill whichever one is causing the problem.  Over time, I've learned when this happens, and my Mac slows to a crawl upon waking it, the source of the problem is almost always Firefox, with a hung up AOL ad.  If I can force quit Firefox, I can (albeit slowly) recover normal function.  My suggestion: put a preference setting for a  timer on these yellow banner ""Stop It"" or ""Wait"" alerts.  If, say, a few minutes go by with no action on the user's part, automatically ""Stop it.""

</p><p>Interestingly when using a music player (e.g. the Spotify App) there are no such problems. I don't know if Spotify prevents that the notebook switches to sleep mode or if Spotify is even able to keep playing music when the notebook turned to sleep mode but it works.

</p><p>I have seen many websites where this issue has been discussed but no resolution.
</p><p>We had been using Chrome but made a decision to instead use Firefox for privacy reasons.
</p><p>At work we have websites that generate PDF files with the name <a href=""http://xmlreport.do"" rel=""nofollow"">xmlreport.do</a> (we have no control over this).  Chrome seems to recognise these .do files as pdf files and offers to save them as such, Firefox does not.
</p><p>Our users are annoyed as there are now extra steps required to change the File Type box to show all the existing pdf files in the download folder so they can more easily rename the file (they click once on an old file then change the date in the file name).
</p><p>Is there a reason Chrome and Firefox treat these differently?  Does Chrome read the file header so it knows what the file actually is (kind of like Irfanview does with images)?  Can Firefox be made to do the same?
</p><p>thanks
