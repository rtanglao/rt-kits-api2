When I click on it in extensions it says the following: ""★★★ Firefox accidentally disabled all extensions, they will fix it soon ★★★
Firefox certificate expired and ALL add-ons got disabled!
Please be patient, do NOT remove any add-ons, Firefox team is working on a fix.""  I use to use Super Start and I lost it so I got Speed Dial because Firefox recommended it, (which they still do) and now I can't get it. I would think after several months it should be fixed. That is what I used as my home page and I had things saved that I have lost.  I would really appreciate some help.

I am connected to a public wifi network. It is free and it is not password protected. It does not ask for credentials. 
Sometimes the above mentioned banner is displayed on top, then it suddenly disappears. It is useless but it could be something happening on the network.
The wifi network has issues, it seems to drop some users according to particular devices, like for examples my Asus S300CA laptop. 
The wifi stays apparently connected but data are interrupted.
My question is about what happens at low level communication with gateway and routers when the captive-portal-like banner is shown in the browser.

Changing the height of the broken element through the Inspect Element tool after the page has loaded fixes the maximum dif height issue.

This was working fine up until today, so something recent changed in an update.
</p><p>KDE is set to ""Breeze Dark"" as the theme. 
KDE's option for GKT2 and GTK3 theme ( settings -&gt; gnome/gtk application style) are set to ""Breeze"" (light theme). 
Firefox's theme is set to ""light"" (it was working with ""default"" as well before). 
</p><p>Almost all GUI elements are defaulting to dark. Menu items, tooltips, scrollbars, checkboxes etc. are dark. Browsing to <a href=""http://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> (which seems to detect if you're in a dark theme/mode) will display in a dark css theme.
</p><p>I've set the following in about:config, but it doesn't seem to fix anything:
ui.systemUsesDarkTheme;0 (fixes the CSS bugzilla issue but nothing else)
widget.content.gtk-theme-override;Breeze (or Breeze:light)
widget.content.allow-gtk-dark-theme;false
</p><p>Basically, despite the fact that i've flipped every switch I can think of to tell firefox ""use a light color scheme"", it still wants to be in the system's overall dark theme. And again, this was working fine a day ago.

Worse, there is no indication that the focus is in the pw box, no blinking cursor, no color change. Worser, on some sites the computer just freezes with the legend in the bottom of the window saying, Waiting for x, x not being the same everytime, but I think it is other websites reading or planting cookies.

Recently updated my 2012 MacBook Pro to macOS 10.15. After Firefox has been open for a while, it stops loading webpages. The title of the page loads, the browser window goes white and never displays anything; the page attempts to load continuously and navigation buttons don't respond. Other than that, Firefox operates and responds as though nothing's wrong. Meanwhile all other browsers can navigate the web just fine. Quitting Firefox (from the menu bar) causes the windows to close but an entry remains in ""Force Quit"" for an extended period. It can be forced closed from here, but doing so causes further attempts to open Firefox to have no windows appear; the only way to reopen Firefox appears to be to restart the whole computer. If allowed to close the rest of the way on its own- which can take up to 10 minutes- the crash dialog appears and Firefox can be restarted.

However, when I restarted firefox recently, it's no longer working.  Ctrl+tab just goes through every tab instead of switching back to the recent tab.
</p><p>I checked my options and it's checked.  
I tried turning it off, restarting firefox, then turning it back on and restarting but that didn't help.
Whether the option is on or off, I get the same behavior of ctrl+tab moving forward through all the tabs.
I restarted with add-ons disabled and that didn't help.
I have ""support:config"" open and I can see the value of ""browser.ctrlTab.recentlyUsedOrder"" toggling between true and false when I check and uncheck the option.
</p><p>I have to use ESR version (company policy enforced) so I'm on 68.1.0esr (64-bit), which appears to be the latest.
</p><p>This problem seems to popup occasionally and then eventually goes away (I guess with a firefox update?).
</p><p>I know I can use ctrl+1 through ctrl+8 to go directly to those tabs, and ctrl+9 to go to the last tab, and I use those keys pretty often, but I have more than 10 tabs open and if I happen to be on tab 20 then switch to tab 10 and want to go back to tab 20, there's no keyboard way to do that.  That's why I really like this option.  It works the same way as alt+tab when switching tasks on windows.

It's way too much effort going to your site, downloading the full version and manually installing it every couple of months and then manually adding policies.json again when you've being accustomed to just going to Help-&gt;About for the same thing... so, thank you once again for managing to make my machine (and probably the ones of many other people too lazy to say anything) much more vulnerable!

</p><p>It's fine that you want inexperienced users to be protected but why does it have to be at the expense of people who know what they're doing and want to decide for themselves when to update?
What was so wrong with the ability to hide update nags from about:config where casual users never touch, that you had to remove it completely?

bookmarks get sync in a very wrong an annoying way:
basically they are multiplied several times and spread all over out of their folders n random order.
many are duplicated, but is not just the full set of them duplicated, 
is more a random thing, some will be tri or quadruplicated, including the folders 
duplicated folders will not have all the same bookmarks inside but a random selection of them.
this happens most times i open my iPhone or laptops and each them will have to restore them from my primary pc.

i have then waited a couple of days so to make sure they would all sync with no bookmarks,
then i restored the original backup set of bookmarks
it worked OK for few days and then started again as before.
it is very annoying and if anyone has a suggestion would be much appreciated

1270658,2019-10-15 08:15:21 UTC,2019-10-15T08:15:21Z,Firefox keeps randomly losing my Saved Logins recently??,"<p>I am noticing a disturbing trend with Firefox browser recently, and that is that almost every other login page I got to in Firefox has lost the saved login that has always been available in the past. I have them mostly written somewhere else, and can still login, after some searching, but this is an unwelcome extra step that I thought Firefox would alleviate, by saving logins for websites. This has never been a problem before as all of these site's login information (usernames &amp; passwords) was saved by the browser to easily populate, but now I go to Preferences&gt;Privacy &amp; Security&gt;Saved Logins, enter the name of the site in the search, and nothing comes up. It is like the browser has never heard of that site before, nor the login information saved?? 
This is frustrating because there is no way for me to check on the json file that contains the saved logins, that I can find. I have been told that the json file may have been changed to json.corrupt., and I should find it, and rename it back to the original, but this is something I cannot find anywhere.
How can I access the json saved login information file to check it please, and why would the browser just be randomly forgetting saved logins??
Oh yes, and Thanks in advance!!

Is this a joke, or has Firefox just completely lost its mind now??
I swear, I am two steps away from completely giving up on Firefox as a browser nowadays, because they seem to be so stuck on security that you cannot even use them as a browser anymore. Pretty much any and ALL convenience of the browser has been lost to the fact that they block almost everything, for one reason or another, and it is getting retarded now....
Can you do ANYTHING on Firefox anymore?? What is wrong with these people, and why are they destroying a great browser in the name of being overly careful??
Don't get me wrong, I am all for security, but not to the point where nothing works at all. There is a level of security that is helpful, and a level that is beyond necessary, which can completely break your experience. This is where Firefox has moved to now, it is getting to where its wants to be so secure that you cannot even surf the web anymore.
Do I need to go over to Chrome, or are the Mozilla people going to get their act together, and save a really good browser, because I am sick to death of nearly EVERYTHING being blocked by Firefox for one stupid reason, or another!!

I'm running into a problem with Firefox that I've not encountered in many years of use, namely that after about 5 or 6 hours of uptime, any open Firefox tab that I refresh or any new one I create gets stuck showing the ""TLS handshake"" note in the lower left and then times out with a message that the server being contacted is not responding.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem but rebooting the Mac does, in that Firefox reaches any site once again.  But then after another 5-6 hours the problem crops up once more.  All other software continues to run just fine during these TLS handshake problems, such as Outlook, Mail, Sonos, etc.  I did not encounter this problem when running Firefox on this machine with Mojave.  Because I'd rather not have to reboot every several hours I'm wondering if anyone has run into this and/or can suggest a fix for this.  Is there a special setting to change or update in Catalina (the only variable I'm aware of that's changed since my upgrade) or in Firefox to work with Catalina's many new settings?  Thank you.

I wanted to use the bottom most folder because I wanted to hide the top folders and move everything in the Bookmarks Sidebar up and to the left.  Also, Other Bookmarks is the default location that bookmarks are stored, so that is convenient.  Using margin-left:-72px and margin-right:-33px, I moved everything in the Bookmarks Sidebar up and to the left so that it hides the Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Menu, and Other Bookmarks moz-tree-rows (folder icons and text).  I made some other minor adjustments to positions and colors too.  The problem is that the margin-top:-72px also affects the results that I get when I search for bookmarks using the search box in the Bookmarks Sidebar.  The margin-top:-72px ends up hiding the first three search results.

</p><p><b>My Request:</b>
</p><p>So maybe someone can give this a try and see if they can find a solution to my problem or just do things better in general.  But try not to be a jerk about it, and chances are whatever you think works for you might not work for me.  I'm not really worried about perfect code vs sloppy code as long as I am getting the results that I want.  I'm just trying to figure out how to make my Bookmarks Sidebar look how I want (as in Screenshot #2) but still be able to see ALL of my search results (as in Screenshot #4 instead of Screenshot #3) and not have the first three search results hidden.
</p><p><br>
<b>Other Information:</b>
</p><p>I had an idea that never went anywhere.  Basically one element changes from selectedIndex=""0"" to selectedIndex=""1"" whenever search results are displayed.  I was hoping to use that as a condition for changing the margin-top or margin-bottom of another element.  It's been ages since I looked into this, so my memory is almost nonexistent.  But I think that the biggest problem was that you can only do ""if this then that"" if you are dealing with children elements, and I was trying to work with parent elements.

I work in GNU/Linux + Gnome with several tabs (around 100). They have different context (research, personal, related to a course, and work; are some examples). I use several windows with several tabs each. I would like to have one group per window, to be able to close a window and not losing the tabs it had, (to close all the windows and be able to reopen them).
</p><p>I cannot find a way to organize my tabs in such a way that windows don't isolate their tabs. There are plenty of add-ons to group tabs. But all of them end up hiding/unhiding the tabs of only the current window.
</p><p>It looks that the underlying architecture is this:
OS has Firefox.
Firefox has Windows.
Windows have tabs.
Tabs are manageable only in the window they belong to.
</p><p>Therefore, every window is only aware of its own group of tabs.
</p><p>What I am looking for is a different approach, or at least the illusion of it:
OS has Firefox
Firefox has Tabs.
Tabs are manageable, from any instance of a window.
</p><p>Therefore, the window is only a viewer that is aware of all the tabs.
</p><p>The plug-ins: 
Panorama Tab Group, Simple Tab Groups, and similar work a bit, but if I open a new window, and do some browsing, the old window does not know anything in the new window.
</p><p>Is there a setting/plugin that can solve this problem? maybe I am missing some setting or I just don't know how to use the plugins...
