Apparently, Javascript is blocked, but after looking at my Firefox settings, I can't find any place where I said not to run Javascript. But if I did choose that setting someplace (Ghostery?), I would like to know if there is an option to list exceptions. I tried to open the Ghostery settings, but a warning came up saying that just by *ENTERING* the custom setup area, all the settings I've already selected will be reset. Even if I don't change anything?? I just wanted to see what settings were there.
</p><p>I realize that Ghostery isn't a Mozilla product, so if this isn't the appropriate place to post this question, I'd appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction. However, if someone here happens to know the answer, I hope that they will just let me know.

But this work-around is required every time I visit the ESPN website, which defeats the purpose of the new video blocking feature of Firefox version 69.

</p><p>hope you can help me understanding this.
</p><p>Browser version: Firefox 60.9.0ESR, installed plugins: NoScript, Ublock Origin, HTTPS Everywhere
</p><p>I'm using NoScript to block all Javascript by default and sometimes I want to verify that blocking works by looking at the console (F12) output.
</p><p>Normally, when I visit a website and NoScript blocks all Javascript ressources, the console (F12) should show me error messages that scripts failed to load.
</p><p>However, on some sites (e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">stackoverflow.com</a>), when I open the console it is completely empty (no output at all) - although Javascript apparently has been blocked (NoScript tells me that it has blocked all scripts and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">stackoverflow.com</a> displays that ""stackoverflow is best viewed with Javascript enabled"").
</p><p>Interestingly, when I leave the console open and refresh that page, all the expected error messages about failed scripts are suddenly displayed in the console.
</p><p>So my questions are:
1) what could be the reason that the expected error messages are only displayed when I refresh the page?
2) could this mean that at the time the console is empty, some scripts are executed? Although NoScript tells me it has blocked all of them and the main site apparently was loaded without Javascript?
</p><p>Your help would be appreciated. Thanks

The old url was jira.nex.lan:8080. The new url is jira.nex.lan (port 80). I like being able to just type in ""jira"" and hit enter. This works great with chrome where I can delete predictions and it actually works. I already tried everything for firefox and nothing works:
</p><p>- Changed the URL for my bookmark from jira.nex.lan:8080 to jira.nex.lan. There are no bookmarks with the old url.
</p><p>- Deleted everything from my history matching jira.nex.lan:8080
</p><p>- Deleted places.sqlite in my profile (which seems to have erased my entire history)
</p><p>- Press the down arrow button and select the prediction and press shift-delete or just delete. This doesn't work because it's the first prediction. Even if I arrow down and then back up to it, pressing shift-delete or delete just deletes the text from the address bar. The prediction always comes back next time. I went through the list and made sure to delete anything below the top that contained the url.
</p><p>After following all of these steps, when I type ""jira"" and hit enter, it still always goes to jira.nex.lan:8080. The only thing I can think of is deleting the entire .mozilla folder, which I expect would work, but it would wipe out all of my customization, which is not OK.

I am aware that the Firefox Default theme adjusts to the system theme automatically, but a minor difference between the Light theme and the Default theme (during the day) is that in the Default theme the tabs remain dark, as opposed to white in the Light theme (see uploaded images). I believe this is intended behavior, and somewhat a pet peeve for me, but nevertheless feel like there should be a workaround for this. Essentially, my question is two-fold:
</p><p>1) Is it possible to edit the Default theme's light/day setting so that the tabs appear white as well?
</p><p>2) If not, then I want to use the Light theme during the day and the Dark theme during the night, but want to auto-toggle between the two, similar to the case in the Default theme. Is it possible to configure this in Firefox, or is there a reliable add-on/script that can manage this.

Whenever visiting twitter I get a bar pop up at the top suggesting I install ""Microsoft's Media Feature Pack"" and links me through to this article - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows</a> , I have the pack installed and it's up to date, I've tired via the Add Features system in Windows and via direct download, both to no avail.
</p><p>Twitter will not load or play videos and netflix is the same. On Netflix I'm getting:
</p><p>""Oops, something went wrong... Unexpected Error"" and error code F7355 (see this article which indicates browser trouble <a href=""https://help.netflix.com/en/node/105186)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.netflix.com/en/node/105186)</a>.
</p><p>Here are some other things I've tried, none of which have worked:
</p>
<ul><li> Checking for updates on windows
</li><li> Checking for firefox updates
</li><li> Checking for updates with the DRM addon Widevine
</li><li> Ensuring Widevine is ""Always Active""
</li><li> Starting firefox in ""Safe Mode""
</li><li> Using a private browsing tab
</li></ul>
<p>I am running:
</p>
<ul><li> Windows 10 Pro N (as said above, I have installed the media pack in several ways)
</li></ul>
<p>OS Build: 18362.295.
</p>
<ul><li> Firefox Developer 70.0b3 64 bit.
</li></ul>
<p>I've also been seeing similar issues on my fiances machine with standard Firefox but her's says that Widevine has crashed on the top bar rather than suggesting we install Window's Media Feature Pack, although the other symptoms are the same. I don't have her machine to hand to grab versions from there but everything is up to date at time of writing and I've tried the same troubleshooting techniques on that machine as well.
</p><p>Really stumped on this one and I'm very reluctant to switch back to Chrome simple to play netflix videos, but likewise it's quite important I can play videos around the web. I'll try anything else to fix it at this point, all suggestions welcome!

Under Options/Security, I do not have the 'Block dangerous and deceptive content' box checked, but Firefox still will not allow me to ""Ignore the risk"" and proceed.  Instead it insists that I register the site as not risky after all, which I can't do because it IS risky... I just want to go there anyway and mess with them.  Thus I'm relegated to using an inferior MS product for this activity.  How do I temporarily circumvent this 'nanny state' protection?

Ocurre desde la actualización a la versión 69.

He intentado varios pasos pero sigue igual.
1 – Inicié en modo seguro, por si el causante fuera un addon.
2 – Reinicié Windows (Firefox nunca me ha pedido reiniciar, pero por si acaso)
3 – Restablecí Firefox.
4 – Desinstalé Firefox con Revo Uninstaller, luego limpié con Ccleaner y busqué manualmente cualquier resto que quedase.
5 – Eso fue ayer, hoy he realizado una instalación totalmente limpia y me encuentro con el mismo problema; sin absolutamente nada, ni marcadores, ni configuración personalizada, ni addons, vamos tal como se instala y nada más. He probado a guardar varios marcadores, he situado el icono …….y nada de nada, deja meterlo pero no se despliega. En la barra de menús sí lo hace pero me resulta mucho más cómodo el icono.

I use PrintFriendly Version 2.10, which is the only available version for Windows.
This has suddenly started to cause text which, in the original, is an indented quote and/or in Italic font, to appear in very large font size, meaning the text uses much more space (and thus paper) than it should.
If I use PrintFriendly on Google Chrome this does not happen.
I want to continue using Firefox, but may have to switch to Chrome.
Please advise.

Based on upgrade-jasonlz4, it was installed 2019 0529. A screen displayed some information that I did not save and cannot find again. It indicated that my previous profile information was inaccessible but not gone, it could be used by running a older version of FF  and that now the profile info was stored on some Mozilla server and that I needed to create a account. This has been very disruptive. The only account I created was to be able to write this and the new FF seems to have created it’s profile in Firefox\Profiles. I have looked at the release notes for versions 66.0 thru 68.0.2 and don’t see anything about a new profile format or compatibility issues. I have Windows Explorer equivalent access to my restore points and see firefox.exe dated 6/10/2019 which differs from the upgrade file date but I could restore the system to that point.
</p><p>So is it true that there is a profile compatibility issue and I need to use the old firefox to use the old profile? If so, why is it not mentioned in the release notes and if not why did the new FF create a new profile?
I found a index of previous versions to DL (<a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/</a>) If I get a suitable version and use custom installation, will I be able to make it use my old profile?

Use some nice dude's tool at <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> to verify the old previous.jsonlz4 has my windows and tabs, and it does.
</p><p>However, there is NO sessionstore.jsonlz4 in my main profile folder, only a bunch of files, which include sessionCheckpoints.json, the only file with any ""session"" in the filename. If I copy my previous.jsonlz4 to that directory (yes, using sudo) as sessionstore.jsonlz4 and run Firefox, it's blank as before, with none of the old tabs or windows. My suspicion at this point is that Firefox 68 on Ubuntu is doing something different than Windows, but I really have no idea. How do the sessions work on Ubuntu, what is the sessionstore.jsonlz4 equivalent?

Synced tabs issue,"<p>I have an android phone running android 9 (Pie) and I had over 100 tabs on it open (mostly news articles and stuff). It is signed into my Firefox account. I realized that's a lot of tabs and the past 2 days I've been actually sorting them and closing some of them.
I realized I could do this on my desktop as well. Anyways my phone froze while I had Firefox open, and I realized my tabs on there were all missing... I decided not to panic yet because I could still get to them on my desktop.
Turns out when I open the ""synced tabs"" pane on my desktop which is logged into the same firefox account.. none of the 100+ tabs are there anymore either.
How do I actually contact someone that can revert my sync status or whatever to a previous state so I can get my tabs and stuff back that I had open?
Firefox crashing on my phone SHOULD NOT EVER somehow close all of those tabs on BOTH the phone and the computer.
I guess the crash of firefox somehow wiped them out, and then my desktop synced with that account, realized those tabs were ""closed"" and cleared the list there as well.

I create a ublock ""global-filter"" of the domain <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, that blocks loading of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> at <a href=""http://123newss.com"" rel=""nofollow"">123newss.com</a> and everywhere else.
For some reason i'm a frequent user of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, and whenever i try to visit <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> i have to 
temporary unblock the blocking of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>. This creates a lot of friction since i'm a frequent user of this url.
If i create a ublock/whitelist of domain <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> then ublock allows every tracker to load at <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, eg. <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> visit triggers loading of <a href=""http://21trackers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">21trackers.com</a>.
</p><p>The idea is - Block tracking urls globally, but allow auto whitelisting of urls when visited directly.
Analogy: prevent embedded yt videos from loading in arbitrary website, but allow when you have visited  <a href=""http://125yt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">125yt.com</a>, without also allowing every other <a href=""http://21trackers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">21trackers.com</a> domains at <a href=""http://125yt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">125yt.com</a> from loading.
Sounds like containerization or ""cross-site"" url loading block.
Is it possible or am i missing something?

Windows 7,"<p>Following some harm done to my desktop system in a household short-circuit, which also included the ""loss"" of my second monitor, any attempt to access Firefox results in a totally black screen (not even a cursor). This requires me to reboot the PC. There are no Crash Reports in the Firefox folder.
Thunderbird &amp; Google Chrome seem unaffected.
Incidentally I was wearing surge protection :-) seems it's no good in such circumstances.
Mozilla's ""educated guesses"" relate to the laptop I'm using for this enquiry, not the desktop.
What's up please?

an old post describes my issue and steps i have taken exactly
Now it is not even creating crash reports after it crashes. What the heck is going on? It all started with the last update! I also already turned off hardware acceleration and the multiprocess function, but every time a tab is open, it crashes, restarts, then does not even provide a crash report that is submitted or unsubmitted. It's just like it never happened! Please help! I'm using Chrome for the time being because the crashing was unbearable. I've also refreshed, reinstalled, and disabled addons. It's still doing it! PLEASE HELP!
