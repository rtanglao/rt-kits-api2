But since I migrated to win10, I've been experiencing a trouble. </p><p>Back in my win7 environment, things were working as intended.  I went to ""about:preferences#privacy"". Then on ""Cookies and Site Data"" section, I ticked ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed."" And on ""History"" section, I chose ""Firefox will Use custom settings for history"". And I ticked ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". Also I ticked all boxes on ""Settings for Clearing History"" window.

All cookies are gone and you're logged out, but I noticed that some sites STILL have some settings.

I opened a page of a location on the weather forecast site, and went to the top page, it of-course remembered the location. But I opened the top page on ANOTHER TAB, it forgets the location.

I use Whatsapp.web to chat when on my PC. I have no trouble connecting to Whatsapp.web using my Iphone and Firefox. However, EVERY time that FF closes, for a restart, or simply when I make a mistake and accidentally close the browser, the connection to Whatsapp.web is apparently broken. I say apparently because on the Iphone, it sontinues to list Windows 10 as an active device using the web app. When I used Microsoft Edge, once I scanned the QR code and connected, I would STAY connected, even overnight after I had shut down the PC. I am wondering if there are certain privacy or security settings which are preventing Whatsapp from staying connected when the FF browser closes. I also remember that a couple of years ago, when I was using FF in the 40s versions, maybe, Whatsapp also stayed connected. Just a note: the reason this is sort of a problem for me is that I am blind, and I use certain visual accessibility settings on Windows and FF that do not allow the Whatsapp QR to be scanned; so I have to change the entirevisual setting of my PC, scan the code, then restore the entire visual setting.

I didn't have to change any settings to have this happen. However, on this newly downloaded version it doesn't do that and it's very frustrating and cumbersome to use. Basically, I have to know that the site wants to pop up a new screen, turn off ublock, and then remember to turn it back on. I have looked all through the ublock and firefox settings to figure out how to do this and can't see where to make this bar show. Very frustrating! Any tips for fixing this?

1277697,2020-01-18 18:17:50 -0800,2020-01-18T21:44:29Z,Video playback issues,"<p>I am currently having issues with Youtube, Netflix, and <a href=""http://vrv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">vrv.co</a>, all video streaming sites over on Firefox, though only in full screen mode, and only on those particular video streaming sites, and I don't know why. As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser. Strangely, safe mode removes the issue, but again, not sure why. I did check another browser— Namely Waterfox Classic. That worked fine. And so far the only suggestion anyone has had from the tech service that I have on the machine has made that makes sense is that this might be a video driver issue. I did just recently update my drivers, this is true. However the issue did not start up until a few days after this had occurred. I tried reinstalling the driver to see if that would fix the issue.  The issue itself is very weird. It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop.  </p><p>Again, Waterfox does not seem to have this issue. At first it was suggested to me on another thread that the issue might be because Waterfox Classic doesn't use hardware acceleration, so I turned that off on Firefox. Which does allow things to play more or less okay, though at times when I scroll, it seems to mess with the screen in a similar fashion to the initial playback issues, and again, it's not consistent with that, just like it's not consistent with the video playback when the browser's Hardware acceleration is on. </p><p>However, I just learned that Waterfox Classic /does/ use hardware acceleration, though it seems to have a much lower content limit set by default. This makes me think that whatever is going on may be a glitch in Firefox itself that may have somehow come up. Though how and why I have no earthly clue, as prior to last Monday there was no issue, as I said earlier. More unusually sometimes the effect vanishes on videos where it's shown up.  </p><p>I have tried to screenhot this and it /never/ appears in screenshots, and doesn't show up when paused either. I've even tried to take a picture of it with my phone or record it with said. Also no luck. I /have/ however, been able to find a video that does this affect deliberately, so I can at least present it here.

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall. </p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen. </p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout. </p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly. </p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second. </p><p>Reproduce: - client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a> - client.html: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ</a> </p><p>1) Put client.js and client.html into a directory and open client.html in Firefox 72. 2) (optional) Do the same but with Chromium. </p>",other;firefox-720;desktop;linux;,firefox,other,en-US,"",anole3623

Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash.  If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in.  Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart.  Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem. </p><p>I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time.  This happened three times in the last six months.  As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on. </p><p>Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop: </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:19:56 achpee kernel: [3642722.464002] Web Content[17741]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f6881995024 sp 00007ffd2548d010 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f687d5ad000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:20:40 achpee kernel: [3642765.713880] Web Content[18209]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f2f71605024 sp 00007fff08ecc490 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f2f6d21d000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:20:53 achpee kernel: [3642778.682450] Web Content[18253]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f46d16fd024 sp 00007ffdf062b6e0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f46cd315000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 21:18:29 achpee kernel: [3653435.096133] Web Content[27212]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f081696d024 sp 00007ffd774ee3e0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f0812585000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 21:19:52 achpee kernel: [3653518.422883] Web Content[28191]: segfault at 3 ip 00007faa3c23d024 sp  00007ffe1e89e1c0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7faa37e55000+4665000] </p><p>No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation.

Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting). </p><p>By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime.  Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached. </p><p>I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms.  Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray?  No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday.
