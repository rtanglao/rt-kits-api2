The win7_64 PC is used with developer apps and UAC is turned off, although there is other 3rd party browser protection running. </p><p>Both PCs have been running FF version 56 with all the tools and addons I know and love.  I also have a link to standalone chrome (dirty word) on each desktop. With more sites going HTTPS with higher security FFv56 was struggling with certificates. I upgraded the 32 bit PC to latest FFv77. The menue bar shows the Favicon in the top right corner for each site visited but when the URL is highlighted and dragged from the locked padlock it appears on the default Win7 blue background as the Firefox icon on a white background. Although I'd prefer the Favicon, I can live with that. </p><p>The Win7_64 no UAC PC running v56 has the same FF icon on a white background. I decided to uninstall V56 from Windows programs and install the latest V77. </p><p>The install finished with all the bookmark links as before (good) but the entire desk top of two monitors full of url links was changed to the FF icons with a BLACK background. On a pale blue screen this is a nightmare garish issue. I over came the first problem of not being able to drag urls by using the launcher switch -no-deelevate. The existing icon links stayed as FF icon on a black background.  </p><p>Then I went to Monitor display settings changing from 32bit to 16 bit colour rebooted and all the desktop links changed. (strange). After reading FF support guidance I changed UAC from zero to default, rebooted and just about everything on the desktop changed with Windows error messages popping up for applications.  I reverted back to AAC and the previous position. </p><p>O.K so now my option was to try an absolutely clean re-install of FFv77. To do this isn't so easy. I searched and found the Mozilla folders and profiles, but there was still an awful lot left in the registry including some keys from previous FF updates and versions. After cleaning that out manually the Win7_64 was as clean of Mozilla as I could make it. Installed latest FFv77 which booted to the default profile but all the existing desktop url links came back with black backgrounds - Horrible! </p><p>Throughout all of this, I can install and open Chrome (still with no PC UAC) and browse o.k, with no surprise changes to desktop links, problems accessing SSL protected sites or having to add custom switches to a startup launcher.  I don't know if my problems are Windows OS related or Firefox new versions have problems with Win7, but there is none of this with Chrome straight out of the box and the issue of Firefox icons and Favicons keeps being raised by others. Some may be able to put up with the black background URL links but when you have a screenful across two monitors IMHO it is really horrible. </p><p>I have an image backup to FFV56 and I'm willing to try something else. What is the default for the FF desktop URLs after a new build, is it a Favicon, Firefox icon on a black background or the same on a white bckground - or something else? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;desktop;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1323848;1324092;1324094;,Jimbo100

Like any extension that modifies the page body (as far as I know), it cannot modify certain pages and sites, such as <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org</a>. For obvious reasons, it can also not modify PDFs opened in Firefox' built-in viewer. However, Firefox seems to always disallow modification if the URL ends in <em>.pdf</em>, regardless of whether that page actually is a PDF file. This becomes a problem on Wikipedia, where <em>File:</em> page URLs always end in their respective file extension, although they are completely regular HTML pages (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExtIPA_chart_(2015).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>).

The mouse cursor changes to a ""loading"" cursor and starts flickering forever, trying to start Firefox. This is bad enough for my whole system to behave strangely, e.g. mouse clicks will randomly not register or release. </p><p>Upon inspecting the task manager, I find that `consent.exe` repeatedly pops up and disappears. I assume it crashes and then firefox tries to restart, repeating in an infinite loop ... I only recently found a dubious/hacky way to stop this without logging out or restarting my pc: When I forcefully rename `C:/Windows/System32/consent.exe` via console, e.g. to `.../consent.exe_`, Firefox will crash ""properly"" with an error message and I can rename it back. </p><p>I have no idea what this `consent.exe` does or why it is called, which makes finding the cause or fixing the issue very hard.. </p><p><br> <strong>Details / attempted fixes</strong> </p><p>The most recent time I had this issue, it appeared after trying to open an external link while Firefox was open. Firefox then found a new update and started automatically updating to the newest version (77.0.1), before trying to open the link and giving an error message (I don't remember what it was..). To properly apply the update I closed Firefox, tried to open it again, and I started getting this infinite crash loop. </p><p>This is not the first time I had this exact same issue, but the cause seems to vary. The first time I encountered this was back when there was a buggy Windows update, which if I read my logs correctly seems to have been at the end of February 2020. As far as I can remember at this time, the issue appeared immediately after restarting my PC and updating Windows (no opening of external links involved). The only way I managed to fix it was by uninstalling that Windows update. I disabled the following updates for some months. At this time I assumed the cause was the buggy Windows update, but since then I had the same issue 4 more times. Of the times I can remember the issue appeared immediately after </p> <ul><li> updating windows </li><li> ?? </li><li> ?? </li><li> clicking an external link </li><li> clicking an external link &gt; automatic Firefox update &gt; restart Firefox &gt; crash </li></ul> <p>Every time I got this issue I tried many things to fix it, including </p> <ul><li> restarting Firefox </li><li> restarting the PC </li><li> deleting my Firefox profiles in `%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` and `%AppData%\..\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` </li></ul> <p>none of the above worked any time I had this issue - nonetheless the issue would disappear randomly without me knowing what fixed it. </p><p>The first time when it was seemingly caused by the buggy Windows update, I even uninstalled and reinstalled all of Firefox, including deleting my Profiles in AppData. Even then, the issue persisted on a completely clean and barebone install of Firefox. However, since then it is seemingly caused by opening external links and the problem always randomly disappeared before I got to try a clean Firefox install. </p><p>The most recent time, the issue disappeared while I was trying `firefox.exe --version`, `firefox.exe --help` to find out my Firefox version (I don't know the correct commands, so nothing happened). This did not work, but when I then tried to start Firefox again, I got about 10 or so error messages on the first attempt (unfortunately, I don't remember the error message..), and then the issue was gone on the second attempt to restart Firefox. </p><p>One other random guess I have is that some of my about:config settings may be related, in particular I completely disabled any links from opening popups, be it a new tab or window. But this sounds really like a bug and I certainly do not want to undo this setting. </p> <hr> <p>In the end I am not even sure if this is a Firefox or Windows issue, and I am also not sure what would be a better place to look for support. Should I submit the above as bug report? </p><p>I am also very reluctant to try to reproduce the issue since I have no idea what the fix is and spent hours on it every time. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1323316;1329855;,chris237

For the remaining logins that I can't eliminate, I get the message ""discard unsaved changes.""  If I do that, then the original user name and password returns.

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, GNOME 3.28.2 with a 64-bit OS.  </p><p>Recently, I noticed that I could not save PDFs from the internet to my hard drive when I was using Firefox. Normally, if I had opened a PDF in Firefox, I could press 'Ctrl + S' on my keyboard and a save dialog window would appear. Now however, the save dialog window would not appear. No error messages appeared, so I have no screenshots to show. The only thing I could do to save the PDF was to click on the 'Download' icon in Firefox's PDF reader. Right-clicking on links to PDFs and selecting 'Save As' would yield the same result: no save dialog window, nothing. </p><p>I thought that the problem might be because my version of Firefox was not up to date, so I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install firefox' in the terminal. I also updated the flash plugin.  </p><p>Afterwards, I noticed that I could not upload files from my hard drive as an attachment for e-mails.

This resolved the problem. I can now save PDF files by pressing 'Ctrl+S' on my keyboard and i can upload files.  </p><p>I'm reporting this because I think other people might encounter the same problem as I did.

The software I installed are also pretty much the same. </li><li> On my Dell, I tried to play videos and Google Play music using Google Chrome, and they work just fine.

I am really good at the command line except for checking library dependencies. :/ </p><p>Last link shows these 5: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item    GTK+ 3.4 or higher </li></ul> <pre>   * Bulleted list item    GLib 2.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    Pango 1.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    <a href=""http://X.Org"" rel=""nofollow"">X.Org</a> 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended) </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item        libstdc++ 4.7 or higher </li></ul> <p>My fear is i'll have to search around a while for the exact package name since sometimes capitalization and dashes matter when using apt, aptitude, or synaptic. </p><p>Here's what I am trying so far.   I started with libstdc++ since that's all lower case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $ apt list | grep libstdc++ | grep -v unstable ... ... (super long list of lots of different libstdc++) ... libstdc++6/stable 8.3.0-6 i386 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So since that ends with version 8.3 and that's higher than the ""4.7 or higher"" in the official list above, then I'm good. (By the way, just a plain `apt list libstdc++` returned no results.) </p><p>And substituting the word 'pango' in the above command gives a similarly long list that looks good, i think. Same with 'gtk3', 'glib2', and 'xorg'. </p><p>Oh, i think i've answered my own question :) but maybe went the scenic route with my command since i did not know the exact package names. </p><p>Anybody have a faster way of checking for these?  Pretty please? :) </p><p>P.S. By the way, I'm using Debian but in my experience it wouldn't matter if i was using Arch or even one of the BSD's right now.  Yes, tools are slightly different like apt/dpkg, or ports but am mostly curious for what exact package names to search for to save me time. :) </p><p>Thanks, you all rock.

With Google and Twitter the password issues wasted only about half an hour, but with Yahoo there's still a problem. It looks as if Firefox is trying to re-enter the e-mail address into the password field even when I've typed in the password. Could this be a problem with Firefox rather than Yahoo?

I have run antivirus scans, and attempted to start Firefox with my antivirus (Avast!) completely disabled. I even tried starting firefox.exe from the command line, using tab completion to ensure that the file existed. No matter what I do, I get an error message from Windows claiming that it can't find firefox.exe, even when this is the result of double-clicking that exact file. This does not happen for any other software, including the portable version of Firefox (which is useless, since nothing is saved and I need my addons). I'm beginning to think that this is the result of either an absurd mistake or deliberate action from Microsoft, as there has been more than one Windows update within the day, and I have noticed other weird issues like my desktop background occasionally just being removed from existence for no reason. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;avast;avast77;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1322344;1322738;1322746;,phyreoligarch

Mozilla Firefox becomes very slow for Google-based services (Google Search, Gmail, YouTube) and unresponsive when HTTP3 is enabled in about:config. Since QUIC is mostly a Google invention and Google services are the ones that utilize it the most, I wonder if Google deliberately slows down Firefox-based QUIC. The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services. There are other non-Google QUIC services and they are actually faster/quicker with Firefox HTTP3 flag enabled.

In this version, but also all the previous versions, I have a problem while scrolling long web pages. Once I have scrolled down quite a bit to far below the immediately visible area, there will be a horizontal area across the entire browser window that does not show anything or is blacked out. It appears as if that area is covering up the info below it (as in a lower layer).  If I continue to scroll further down, these blacked out areas appear regularly. This forces me to switch to another browser (Chrome, Edge) where the problem does not occur, just so that I can read that info or access the buttons etc. hidden in FF.  I am working with a Lenovo Laptop attached to a docking station and two extra 27 inch screens that are turned to vertical and stand side by side.  The attached Screenshot gives you an idea. It was taken from this page: <a href=""https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/</a> with the parameter for number of items to display in the table below the map set to ""Alle"". The blacked-out area appears 8 or nine times. The page is only an example - the problem occurs on just about every page that requires a lot of downward scrolling. And the problem is also unrelated to a specific website.

I can no longer use Firefox to pay online with StateFarm.  This started suddenly a few months ago. I had no problem navigating to the payment login page with State Farm, then one day I clicked the link and received an error page. I called State Farm Technical service and they suggested I try another browser.  It works fine in Chrome.  I like exclusively using Firefox.  Can this link be made to work on Firefox again? 2.  All of a sudden Firefox stopped opening links in webpage.  It doesn't open a new tab, it doesn't open Adobe Acrobat.  All I get is a flash of the download arrow.  I then need to go through multiple steps to download/open/save whatever it is I'm looking for.  If I don't see the flashing download arrow, it just looks like nothing has happened.  I'm assuming this change came in some update recently.  I have looked in options, but don't see how I can reset the options so links open automatically.   3.  In Options, I noticed a banner iYour browser is being managed by your organization.  I use Avast.  Your article about this suggests turning off Avast for web browsing, but that is advice in direct opposition to my computer guy.  I don't care about the banner if I know why it's there.  There is no harm coming from it, right? </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1321679;1321812;1321817;,ksconsulting
1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,2020-06-08T12:02:11Z,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"<p>I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"". This comparison exemplified that resource consuming from inside and outside looks very different. The second conclusion is that network usage ten or more times lower than disk usage, which should not be even if content is unpacked and saved. And the main question is why disk usage are close to memory consuming. This speaks in favor of the fact that disk usage is inefficient and surplus: most data can be stored in memory. Let's consider the attached screenshots. The first part of screenshot 'Firefox external metrics@77.0.1' consists of two parts with ProcessHacker window and contains the following external metrics of the parent firefox process: </p> <ul><li> Working set = 2 GB (summed over children processes) </li><li> Virtual size = 3.25 GB </li><li> Network total bytes = 287.1 MB </li><li> Disk total bytes = 3.02 GB </li><li> Disk write bytes = 2.48 GB </li><li> Disk read bytes = 551.23 MB </li></ul> <p>The firefox process structure is in the second part of that screenshot. The same observation -- excessive resource consuming exemplified by the same metrics. To estimate total memory consuming, I closed Firefox and compared memory usage by ""System information"" (ProcessHacker's tool): the commit charge level decreased by 4.2 GB and the physical memory level decreased by 2.7 GB. This means that 1.5 GB memory pages are in the paging file, i.e. stored on the disk! In comparison with Windows 7 memory consuming, we see 748 MB versus 2.7 GB in physical memory. Does Firefox indeed execute so many tasks and provide so many functions and deliver so much value as Windows 7 Pro operating system? The comparison Firefox versus MS Word 2010 with 20 opened documents (about 200 MB RAM consumed) leads to the same observation: the former has much higher resource consuming per functionality/value. </p><p>However, Firefox's ""about:cache"" and ""about:performance"" don't report such resource consuming: see the according screenshots. I summed memory usage by web pages enumerated in ""about:performance"": all 16 loaded web pages consumed 522 MB in total instead of 2.7GB physical memory and 4.2 GB virtual memory. What does Firefox really do?! This is why I suppose that Firefox executes hidden extraneous tasks. To those who would like to analyze Firefox's memory report in detail, I saved and published it: <a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg</a>  </p><p>My point is that disk I/O operations should be decreased significantly in order to prevent Firefox from hanging and to decrease response time on user actions. There are several measures to do it. First, stop using RAM in uncontrolled and ineffective manner as we saw it even on 16 web pages. This means estimating and measuring memory overhead per content byte, per user-level function and per delivered value. Second, stop using disk-based databases, use in-memory databases instead. Third, use effective data structures and data architecture. To prevent memory page unloading, use OS API to disallow unloading of desired memory pages using proper attribute. Yes, if your data/programming languages do not satisfy these critical requirements, use another one. If your data/programming technology do not satisfy these critical requirements, just change it. If your values interfere with this approach, then make the browser’s mission to be the main value -- visualizing hypertext to the user quickly, cheaply, conveniently and effectively. All other values around it have lower priority, remember! No one need safety and transparency and so on if the browser hangs with other process in the system or web page loads more than 0.5 second on a real device. This means you should not suppose the modern or superpower device -- you should suppose any device with one CPU of 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM. These resources are enough to display even 100 pages of 1 MB each in size, obliviously. Just because 1920x1600 = 3072000 bytes (one byte per pixel), i.e. about 3 MB per screen image. The main thing the browser do is it transforms 1 MB of input content into 3 MB image of output. Five or eight GB of RAM is too excessive to this operation, isn't it? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321683;,alexworad

Now this doesn't happen when in normal mode meaning not in picture in picture mode, So basicly i'm saying could you guys look into making picture in picture full screen mode not make the screen go to sleep like in a normal player, I understand I can also turn off picture in picture mode or turn my screen auto turn off after a few minutes off but I would think it would be much better if the picture in picture full screen mode worked the same as watching something in a normal player which doesn't make your screen turn off, Not sure if its a bug or was just over looked either way thought I would let you guys know. Also want to add that picture in picture mode is a great idea, I have always wanted to beable to watch something while working when only having 1 screen and picture in picture works great for that keep up the good work!

I am also not alone in this matter because as soon as the change was established, communities popped within hours to fix the problem.

Now after the update to 77, the Megabar is back and forced down everyone's throat and the old about:config is no longer the fix to this terrible experience. Literally after an hour of this trashbar being up, videos and guides popped up to try to fix it. Whole communities have been formed to hate this feature and ask Firefox to change it, or at least make it optional to go back.  My question is, looking through google has only come up with the chrome.css(?) fix to this mess. Is there any way to change it back to the old url bar without having to go through the chrome.css fix or just uninstalling and reinstalling a previous Firefox or do I have to just migrate to another browser like Opera or Chromium? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321449;1321451;1321460;1321467;1321590;1321789;1321792;1322832;1322866;1322892;1322903;1322922;1322937;,quizibo

I saw that setting ""browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests"" to ""true"" might be the solution but, while it does stop the address bar from expanding when using it, it also stops it from expanding at all so the websites that would come up from searching can no longer be seen either (they are still called and using the down arrow will let me scroll through the results, I just can't see any of them). It also doesn't fix the results issue which I would say is the most important. </p><p>I would like to know what I need to do so that: 1. The results it shows me are no longer based on frequent visit (basically, the pre-update search system, as is they are scattered and look messy, pulling many different sites in a seemingly random order and it's not particularly useful) 2. It no longer autocompletes results (IE. ""F"" autocompleting to ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"", this is always something that has bothered me regardless is context) 3.

I'm working to save people's lives against COVID-19, and Firefox, not Chrome is causing ALLof my gmail accounts to quickly and automatically sign out. For almost a month, and with great diligence and frustration in trying to troubleshoot this a couple of different ways (according to Mozilla and others)), nothing has prevailed.  </p><p>Could it be the great number of open windows and tabs that cause it, because that is my last (but not yet tested theory).  Most of the times the sign out occurs when the email draft automatically saves itself, and the site disconnects. How I know this, is gmail says it's trying to reconnect. There's also a message saying my hangouts isn't signed in, but neither is it signed in with Chrome  One more thing. Every day for the last 3 years, I use CC cleaner to remove cookies and cache, so it can't be that. You'll have to come up with something Mozilla hasn't yet thought of yet. </p><p>And lastly, Firefox Lockwise (when it was active), prevented me from finding my ""SAVED LOGINS"", gmail account. Not even the search engine could find it (both when Lockwise was active, and after I cancelled the account). This program prevented me from finding my own password, which was needed urgently. And now, I can't get rid of Lockwise, even after cancelling the account. Anf from what I see, I'm forced to sign up with the account again, just to ask this question. Nobody likes the bully, so please help me PERMANENTLY remove Lockwise from my system?

I only get the graphic elements displayed, not of the actual text is rendered. Similar with <a href=""http://www.tuxmachines.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.tuxmachines.org</a>, all the graphic elements are displayed but all of the text is hidden, looking in page source you can see the text is present. Likewise if you receive an email from UPS the message body is largely blank because the text is all hidden in the html they send, but appears fine in the Claws email agent. Where or what to look for? Could it be font(s) related? I've tried clear cache and restarting in safe mode, same effect. k. </p>",websites;desktop;linux;,firefox,websites,en-US,1321197;1321255;,kicking177

I send the report then go to reapply the solution I used before only to see that they are all still set to false but that bar is still popping out and my easy access drop down of sites I visit most is gone. Please, can anyone help me get rid of this bar. I've tried restarting the browser and no luck.

I hated the URL bar that was added in 75 and found it back again in 77 so I tried to turn it off again. After finding that the only solution effectively broke the URL bar (switching browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests to false for reference which stopped it from expanding at all, including to see the websites in the drop down) and no other setting changes did anything, I tried going back to version 76 since the URL bar remained as I had set it in 75. However, because of the profile protection, I would need to manually add everything back (on top of that, I couldn't restore the URL bar with the changes that worked in 75 anyway) so, deciding it wasn't worth the trouble, I updated back up to version 77. </p><p>Now, a few websites aren't loading correctly. For example, YouTube only loads gray placeholder boxes and the sidebar elements are completely unresponsive. Trying to load a video from history also doesn't work as the page just remains blank. YouTube isn't the only site with this issue either though they have varying degrees of functionality. However, I don't know why those sites aren't working while others that I would think are somewhat similar (IE. DeviantArt, Reddit) are working. While I don't think anything I changed in the about:config had anything to do with this as I only went through the URL stuff, I don't know for sure and is why I included the little backstory above. </p><p>I've tried refreshing the tab as well as closing Firefox completely and reopening it but the issue has persisted. </p><p>I tried uploading an image of what YouTube looks like.

It's especially helpful when I only have one monitor. There are a couple of rough-edges I'd like to see tweaked. </p><p>1. I resize these windows all the time to put them where they'll fit when I'm doing something else, and it can finicky to resize the window quickly. It would be helpful if the areas you can grab the edges and corners of were exaggerated. For example, if when the user's mouse is near an edge or corner of the picture-in-picture window a handle pops-up around the given area that's larger than the 1pixal-ish default handle area. I've seen similar functionality in the art program GIMP for selection boxes. </p><p>2. The way the window acts when being resized isn't very intuitive. The corners work as expected, but since the corner areas are so small I often grab the sides and that can get frustrating. I now know that when grabbing the Bight and Bottom sides of the window the Top-Left corner is anchored while resizing. Similarly, when grabbing the Left and Top sides of the window the Bottom-Right corner is anchored.  That seems pretty intuitive when I type it out, what's the issue? Well, the problem comes when you are grabbing the window near the corners. If for example, I'm trying to grab the window by the Bottom-Left corner and miss (which I've done plenty) and grab the Bottom of the window. Now when I resize the window is anchored in the Top-Left instead of the Top-Right, which is the opposite of what I wanted and leads to some confusion and repositioning. What I would suggest, separate from the #1 solution, would be to break the sides of the window into three areas: Near-corner 1, Center, and Near-corner 2. When grabbing the window on the edge in one of the Near-corner areas, anchor the window at the opposite corner. When grabbing by the center of an edge anchor the window by the opposite center.  </p><p>Thank you for reading my long suggestion. I hope you don't find this to be a negative interaction. I truly enjoy Firefox, and I've very excited about your new Picture-in-picture feature. I hope you understand that this level of nit-picking can only come from a place of love!  </p><p>P.S: I'm very pleased to say that I did not include a third issue I had with the Spacebar Play/Pause functionality not working unless the Play button was the last object clicked on the window, because in the latest update it was gone! I want to thank whomever worked on that and let them know, someone did notice, and they appreciate it! &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-7;feature-request;,firefox,customize,en-US,1321030;,darkkenchi

My mental defects did not prevent me finding thousands of web pages explaining how to complete this task.  However, my mental defects prevented me finding any explanation created since the formation of the internet (I am estimating the internet first formed in 2008, because the dates of the answers I found indicated as such (anything before 2013 is basically the same as 2008 for internet purposes).  And so, I am here to beg a moment of your time to help me resolve this risk to my mental health which will be extremely serious if caching does not discontinue its anti-social activities. </p><p>LEST YOU THINK I AM HELPLESS I found my way to about:config, entered cache into the search and up came about eighty various cache, assundry and other forms of affiliated/associated items.  The list is diverse, but every item on the list has one very special thing in common with all the others, and as a group, they achieve an astonishing feat.   </p><p>WHAT THESE configs HAVE IN COMMON All eighty configs produce by the procedures above have the letters c-a-c-h-e somewhere within them in that precise sequence, with no intervening or otherwise contrary letterizations. </p><p>THEIR COLLECTIVE FEAT They manage to organize themselves to perfection, including among them every single config containing the letters c-a-c-h-e in that exact order.  No slackers calling in with covid or excuses of dogs eating their homework, all do their part in the roll call when its taken this way.  This kind of character is exemplary and inspiring. </p><p>THE PROBLEM I attempted to calculate how many combinations of values these eighty configs can have.  I got as far as determining a penny for each combination would amount to more than 400 times the gross product of economic activity since the dawn of recorded history. </p><p>STRATEGY Since trying every combination is too time consuming, my goal is to go straight to the correct config adjustment to send the cache away. </p><p>HYPOTHESIS Changing the last item on the list, marked 'cache' from TRUE to FALSE will produce the cacheless experience I must achieve in order to not impersonate a Molotov Cocktail. </p><p>The attached image shows what I have in mind.

I also tried the monitor resolution and different desktop themes. </p><p>If this is not a bug, I am hoping I can disable something so that the window returns to its original position after it is unmaximized.  For example, the height of the top border decreases when the window is maximized and increases when unmaximized, so if this is causing the issue, I am happy to disable it. </p><p>In the attached images, the top right of the image is the top right of the desktop.  The first image shows Firefox in the top right corner before maximizing the window, and the second image shows the shifted position after unmaximizing the window.

What I need from them is to behave the way it will be most practical for me, which isn't necessarily aligned with the majority of users. </p><p>My current problem is this. I work with APIs which in my daily work often return various HTTP errors. These errors also contain a payload which describes the problem in detail. I want to be able to see this payload easily in the browser. Yes, I can use other tools like Postman for this (which I do), but for simple GET requests without special request headers it would be much more practical to just use a browser. </p><p>Currently, when my API opens an error (for example a 400 Bad Request), Firefox decides to just silently go back into the previous page (undos the URL change). If I open the Network tab in the Web Developer view, I can however see the failing response with all of its details. Still, this is too impractical for me. </p><p>BTW, the response contains a custom Content-Type which isn't recognized by Firefox by default. But Firefox isn't downloading the payload as a file (like it would usually do for a successful page load of an unknown Content-Type), it just silently doesn't do anything. I've installed an extension to handle my custom Content-Types (called ""Open in Browser""), but since Firefox isn't attempting to open this one, I can't use it in this case. </p><p>So, how can I force Firefox to stay on that URL and show the response payload in the window?

Now I found two bugs: </p><p>Gateway timeout: While developing I got a gateway timeout for an endpoint of my current project. In the console this is correctly logged but in the network monitor I don't see anything. This is quite confusing. The console log looks like this: </p><p>ERROR Error: ""Uncaught (in promise): S: {""headers"":{""normalizedNames"":{},""lazyUpdate"":null,""headers"":{}},""status"":504,""statusText"":""Gateway Timeout"",""url"":""https://myurl.myurl/profil"",""ok"":false,""name"":""HttpErrorResponse"",""message"":""Http failure response for https://myurl.myurl/profile: 504 Gateway Timeout"",""error"":null}"" </p><p><br> Replaying request: Very useful feature, however it seems to have an issue with Authentication headers. When my angular application does a service call it works fine. When I then replay this request I get the response of the backend: 401 you are not logged in. Upon closed inspection I printed out the headers in this response and noted that after replaying the request the header ""Authentication: Bearer ...."" is missing. </p><p>Any hints how to fix these issues? </p><p>Also is this the correct space to report issues/bugs? I also found this url: <a href=""https://github.com/mdn/kuma/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mdn/kuma/issues</a> which i'm not quite sure whether it would be the right space to open tickets for firefox network monitor tool. </p><p>Thanks for your help! </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1318704;1322945;,judos

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;1319551;1319559;,ji.perez.marturet
