It may be Joomla itself, although this does not explain why automatic login is possible if cookies are never cleared. Everything i could find regarding Joomla logins is old, and of course, it depends entirely on how the administrator has configured Joomla on the server. Theoretically, if the Joomla login box does not have a ""Remember me"" check box, one should never be able to login automatically. And any cookie (a session-only cookie) set will be blocked server-side and destroyed at the beginning of a session if it exists. (This behavior likely can be changed by  available or custom plug-ins.)  </p><p>I <em>hope</em> that something works for you here.

1277817,2020-01-20 11:46:17 -0800,2020-01-22T21:58:52Z,How can I keep Whatsapp.web connected even when I close Firefox?,"<p>I am using the currect version of FF, 71 or 70. something, not sure but I just updated. I use Whatsapp.web to chat when on my PC. I have no trouble connecting to Whatsapp.web using my Iphone and Firefox. However, EVERY time that FF closes, for a restart, or simply when I make a mistake and accidentally close the browser, the connection to Whatsapp.web is apparently broken. I say apparently because on the Iphone, it sontinues to list Windows 10 as an active device using the web app. When I used Microsoft Edge, once I scanned the QR code and connected, I would STAY connected, even overnight after I had shut down the PC. I am wondering if there are certain privacy or security settings which are preventing Whatsapp from staying connected when the FF browser closes. I also remember that a couple of years ago, when I was using FF in the 40s versions, maybe, Whatsapp also stayed connected. Just a note: the reason this is sort of a problem for me is that I am blind, and I use certain visual accessibility settings on Windows and FF that do not allow the Whatsapp QR to be scanned; so I have to change the entirevisual setting of my PC, scan the code, then restore the entire visual setting. Any ideas how to keep Whatsapp.web connected always, or at least as long as I don't end my Windows session? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-720;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1283122;1283196;1283402;1283485;1283541;1283610;1283719;,greene8097,"id:1283719,created:2020-01-22 21:58:52 -0800,updated:2020-01-22 21:58:52 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I hope this works better in the future.

I started looking for support and chose to uninstal v72 - shut down my laptop and restarted it. I downloaded the latest version and at the end of install - where 'run firefox' is expected - nothing happened. I have since uninstalled and downloaded the latest beta version (73) - and now, when I ask to run the program, it opens a window but all the tabs are 'dead' and no matter what I type, the program does not connect to the internet (i.e. Google search or direct to a known web address). If I select settings, I can see the drop-down list - but if I select 'Add-ons' (for example) - nothing happens. I attempted to run my laptop in safe mode, but I have no recall of the password needed to get past the login screen.

Long ago, I enabled ""Show tab previews in the Windows taskbar"" in Options and until a week or two ago, whenever I hovered over the Firefox icon in the taskbar, a small image of the web page in each tab would appear above the taskbar. If I hovered over an image, it would then become full screen and readable.

However, if i use chrome then the problem disappears (sort of, i still only get 200mbps max upload/download speeds). Ive already tried clearing my cookies/cache. and restarting Firefox. The issue is not with a certain website, but with all download/uploads across the board. The weird part is that i can upload several files and each will upload at 7mbps per file but they will never go above 7mbps. ive tried disabling my add-ons and nothing changes. If i check my internet speed on firefox, i do get 500/500 speeds, so i dont know what it could be. its not a big deal to have to switch to chrome whenever i want to upload/download something, but its something id rather not have to do. ive been using firefox for as long as i can remember and ive never had an issue like this. </p><p>Im using task managers performance tab to see the upload speed and using firefox's download icon to see the download speed. </p>",firefox-720;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1282511;1282752;,shadowkon626,"id:1282752,created:2020-01-19 18:02:10 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 18:02:10 -0800,creator:shadowkon626,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>that doesnt help at all, i still want to upload things. </p> id:1282511,created:2020-01-19 00:40:53 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 00:40:53 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Go to the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Add-ons Web Page</a> {web Link} (There’s a lot of good stuff here) and search for a download manager. </p>"

1277697,2020-01-18 18:17:50 -0800,2020-01-18T21:44:29Z,Video playback issues,"<p>I am currently having issues with Youtube, Netflix, and <a href=""http://vrv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">vrv.co</a>, all video streaming sites over on Firefox, though only in full screen mode, and only on those particular video streaming sites, and I don't know why. As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser. Strangely, safe mode removes the issue, but again, not sure why. I did check another browser— Namely Waterfox Classic. That worked fine. And so far the only suggestion anyone has had from the tech service that I have on the machine has made that makes sense is that this might be a video driver issue. I did just recently update my drivers, this is true. However the issue did not start up until a few days after this had occurred. I tried reinstalling the driver to see if that would fix the issue.  The issue itself is very weird. It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop.  </p><p>Again, Waterfox does not seem to have this issue. At first it was suggested to me on another thread that the issue might be because Waterfox Classic doesn't use hardware acceleration, so I turned that off on Firefox. Which does allow things to play more or less okay, though at times when I scroll, it seems to mess with the screen in a similar fashion to the initial playback issues, and again, it's not consistent with that, just like it's not consistent with the video playback when the browser's Hardware acceleration is on. </p><p>However, I just learned that Waterfox Classic /does/ use hardware acceleration, though it seems to have a much lower content limit set by default. This makes me think that whatever is going on may be a glitch in Firefox itself that may have somehow come up. Though how and why I have no earthly clue, as prior to last Monday there was no issue, as I said earlier. More unusually sometimes the effect vanishes on videos where it's shown up.  </p><p>I have tried to screenhot this and it /never/ appears in screenshots, and doesn't show up when paused either. I've even tried to take a picture of it with my phone or record it with said. Also no luck. I /have/ however, been able to find a video that does this affect deliberately, so I can at least present it here. Again, this is not consistent, seems to move around the screen, and only seems to occur on those three video sites as I stated. Apparently whatever the issue is, it's /NOT/ something to do with the hardware acceleration, as I learned, again, that WaterfoxClassic /does/ use it and it is active in that browser, and was active when I first tried it, so that narrows it down to some kind of glitch either with Firefox or Windows and how it interacts with either the former or the latter, depending on where the glitch is coming from.  </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's causing this? </p><p>The image attached is an example of what I'm seeing, however, bear in mind that this video is /deliberately/ showing this effect in an attempt to replicate the type of thing one might see on old video tapes being played after years of disuse, but it /is/ the same general appearance, more or less, of what I occasionally see on Firefox when using the videos on the above mentioned sites. </p>",other;firefox-720;desktop;firefox-7201;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1282463;1282466;1282470;1282478;1282482;1282485;,Marc7,"id:1282485,created:2020-01-18 21:44:29 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 21:44:29 -0800,creator:Marc7,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>crankygoat <a href=""#answer-1282482"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled   -- I am not an expert on the Web APIs for media or anything else, but my guess is whether or not what capabilities the display reports are used along with other factors (the ability to decode the input, etc.) to determine what format video to send.

We learned that turning off the hardware acceleration seemed to be the best option when I brought the issue up in another thread, one related to Waterfox when I ended up getting sent to this help forum when I clicked on Waterfox Help after downloading Waterfox Classic. Not sure what actually makes it 'classic' compared to whatever is regular Waterfox. But yeah, someone had suggested turning off the extensions one at a time, and seeing if any of them was the cause of the issue. Now unless I did it wrong, as I would turn one off, restart the browser, and if nothing had changed, I would turn that back on and repeat the process with the other two, none of the extensions seem to be the problem. I was even able to test adblock plus on Waterfox Classic, and that clearly was not the <a href=""http://issue.No"" rel=""nofollow"">issue.No</a> script didn't have a counterpart that worked on it, and my Webroot filtering extension doesn't even come up on the thing. Plus, none of those had ever been a problem on Firefox up until last Monday at around 8 or 9 pm eastern standard time. Prior to that, everything had worked fine. I had updated Firefox to version 72.0.1 just a few days before, and also updated my graphics card's drivers, and the day after, I had just put through the latest optional update to Windows 10. So at least we can rule the latter out as the problem.  </p><p>Like I said, I have little idea what even caused the issue to begin with.  </p><p>Oh, if it helps, my video card is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965m. </p> id:1282482,created:2020-01-18 21:33:39 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 21:33:39 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled   -- I am not an expert on the Web APIs for media or anything else, but my guess is whether or not what capabilities the display reports are used along with other factors (the ability to decode the input, etc.) to determine what format video to send.

I did notice a bunch of things were listed as having been modified and reverted them, but that didn't seem to help either.

It also means I face a similar issue when scrolling— though again much like with the video playback this is entirely inconsistent, but that may just be the price of having video working without using a different browser.  And again, last week it was perfectly fine. Though to be fair, I believe I was on either version 71 or 72 of Firefox rather than 72.0.1 at that time, as I did an update to 72.0.1 a few days before this glitch started up.

The easiest way to do this is to go to the <code>about:support</code> page by typing that into the Firefox address bar. On that page, in the <strong>Applications Basics</strong> table, there is a <strong>Profile Folder</strong> row. If you press the <strong>Open Folder</strong> button in that row. </p><p>That should open the profile folder using the regular file browser on your computer. This is the folder were all of your bookmarks and other information is saved for Firefox to use. However, this is the folder that was cleared out when you refreshed Firefox. Leave this open so that you know where to find it. </p><p>Next, go to your desktop and open that <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder. In there are some of the old files from before you refreshed Firefox. Most notably, you should see a file called <code>places.sqlite</code> in that folder. That's the file that your bookmarks and history is saved into. </p><p>Now, it's going to depend on what you want to save. If you are only looking to save the bookmarks you had in Firefox, you can just copy the <code>places.sqlite</code> file from the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder and paste it into the profile folder (what we opened from the <code>about:support</code> page earlier). </p><p>If you want to try and recover everything you had before, you can copy the entire contents of the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder into your Firefox profile folder. </p><p>When copying stuff over, you will probably be asked if you want to overwrite files. If you have nothing on the current Firefox that you are running, you can overwrite everything without any issues. Firefox does need to be closed in order to properly replace all of the files, so make sure to copy or print these steps. </p><p>Incidentally, if you do happen to need to find this page again, you can find it under your Firefox Account profile for this website. When you go back to <code>support.mozilla.org</code> and log in, you can hover over your name in the top-right of the website and select <strong>View Profile</strong>. That opens your profile page and you can click the <strong>X Answers</strong> link on that page to see the questions that you have posted in. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1308119,created:2020-04-23 14:40:59 -0800,updated:2020-04-23 14:40:59 -0800,creator:robstowe,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I have just bookmarked this page.......................  but bookmark folder is still empty </p><p>It is nothing like the set up before </p><p>there was a five subject click list at top left of screen.  no where to be seen now </p><p>now bookmarking [which doesnt work anyhow ] is acessed from the three books wi one falling down symbol :-( </p> id:1308117,created:2020-04-23 14:35:41 -0800,updated:2020-04-23 14:35:41 -0800,creator:robstowe,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>yes I do,  but what exactly do I do ? </p><p>its 10.30 I am going to bed but will not switch off lapto cos I am concerned I cannot navigate back to this page without bookmarking or history </p><p>Sounds mad tell me bout it </p><p>thanks for response but I do need step bt step I am not pc pro, old guy with failing memory strange but true </p> id:1308092,created:2020-04-23 13:34:06 -0800,updated:2020-04-23 13:34:06 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Hi robstowe! </p><p>Do you have the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder on your desktop?

I can live with the silly warning that Firefox is ""slow loadIng"".  What saves me from other similar situations is mostly that I keep all of my relevant bookmarks on external .htm pages and only those ""file:///c:/[groupname]/[filename].htm"" references are included in my bookmarks.  So I click on the group identifier in my bookmarks line, locate the specific site that I want to visit, and off I go.  This procedure is largely because I have HUGE NUMBERS of sites that I want to visit from time to time for various ""group"" reasons and I'm really not interested in sharing the multitudinous lists with anybody who might have access to my Firefox browser.  It's also because there are soooo many such sites that a Bookmarks line could not even conceivably show even the most important ones.  This is just a thought on how things ""might"" work better for you in the future. </p> id:1282391,created:2020-01-18 13:44:30 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 13:44:30 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes2,content:<p>There should be an <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder on your desktop, which you can use to recover your data.

When creating my Firefox account I used one of these email addresses, and received a notification saying the verification email failed to send and was returned, and my account was locked out. Then I realized I forgot to enable the specific email address for my domain before trying to create the account, so I went and activated the correct address, tested it, and then tried logging in / creating my account again, but was just given the same 'locked out' error. </p><p>Can you guys unlock my account? I have the login information and the email address is working now, but the site just keeps saying that the verification email failed to send, instead of trying to send a new one or something. If you guys can't just unlock it, then it is fine if you can just reset it or completely remove it, so I can create it again with the same email, since the account was brand new and didn't have anything on it yet. </p>",download-and-install_1;firefox-730;beta;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1282350;1282385;1282429;,altgage,"id:1282429,created:2020-01-18 16:50:28 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 16:50:28 -0800,creator:altgage,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1282385"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> See: <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq</a> </li></ul>  <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li></ul> </blockquote> <p>I think it has been almost 24 hours so I guess I will try again in a little bit, but as for the other two links, I can't sign in to the account to even try those like I said in my post... </p> id:1282385,created:2020-01-18 13:35:56 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 13:35:56 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>See: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq</a> </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li></ul> id:1282350,created:2020-01-18 12:21:20 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 12:24:20 -0800,creator:altgage,updated_by:{""username""=>""altgage"", ""display_name""=>""gege"", ""avatar""=>""https://firefoxusercontent.com/00000000000000000000000000000000""},is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Obviously it isn't the account I am posting on right now.

I have the Premium Ultra HD subscription. </p><p>For reference, I am running a computer with Windows 10 Pro 64 bit (version 1909), I have hardware acceleration enabled in Firefox, my content process limit is set to eight, and my computer has a dedicated AMD Radeon RX 470 dedicated GPU, running the latest stable driver version, 19.12.2.  </p><p>I've chatted to a Netflix representative and they pointed me to this page <a href=""https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742</a>, where it states that Netflix has a maximum quality of 720p when using Firefox. Stangely, it also says this is the case for Google Chrome on Windows 10, but Netflix playback on Chrome appears noticeably clearer to me. Edge is clearer still, though that support page says that browser supports up to 4K playback. </p><p>Has anyone else had the same or similar issues when watcing Netflix using Firefox? If so, have you found any remedies or ways to improve the quality? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",fix-problems;firefox-720;desktop;firefox-7201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1282426;1282525;1282583;1282654;,rowan_lovejoy,"id:1282654,created:2020-01-19 11:40:46 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 11:41:41 -0800,creator:rowan_lovejoy,updated_by:{""username""=>""rowan_lovejoy"", ""display_name""=>""gr3821"", ""avatar""=>""https://firefoxusercontent.com/726b724bc809030e3e38284bc093ddfe""},is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>d.mattera <a href=""#answer-1282583"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Hmm, in that case can you do the following in order to confirm Netflix is in fact streaming at the highest resolution (720p) for you in Firefox?  1. Begin playing a video on Netflix  2. Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D to bring up the Netflix debugger  3. Find the setting labeled ""Playing bitrate"". The current resolution Netflix is streaming to you is the value in parenthesis at the end of this setting:  Example: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/fHv1a5C.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Doing so on my own system</a>, it shows ""1280x720"" a.k.a. 720p. Should yours show something different, I would suspect this may be something on Netflix's end.  Additionally, you may want to try creating a fresh Firefox profile and then trying Netflix with the new profile enabled. This will ensure the issue is not due to any of your addons or settings you may have changed. </blockquote> <p>Hi d.mattera, </p><p>Thanks for the follow-up. </p><p>My playing bitrate reads 960 x 540 in Firefox. This did not change after leaving the video running for several minutes.  </p><p>For reference, I also tried this in Chrome and Edge. Strangely, Chrome also gave this 960 x 540 readout. For confirmation, I asked another person in my house, who primarily uses Chrome, to check their playing bitrate: it was 1280 x 720.

This permission is certainly something that other people have been concerned/confused about before.  <ol><li> Theoretically, yes. While the extension won't have access to the past data that you've entered, it can see anything that loads on the page or is entered on the page while it's installed. There are some exceptions, like internal Firefox pages or Mozilla-owned pages, where extensions are not allowed to view the page. </li><li> No, when an extension is disabled, it's not running. Therefore, it can't see any websites. </li><li> Aside from the exceptions I mentioned in my answer to your first question, theoretically, yes. </li><li> Extensions don't have direct access to the passwords saved on Firefox, until they are entered into the website. So, if an extension is tracking a password text input box, then it could (theoretically) see the data that's entered. </li><li> Like you said, users should make sure to use add-ons they can trust. The majority of add-ons are not using this permission in a malicious way. </li><li> The add-ons in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/recommended-extensions-program"" rel=""nofollow"">Recommended Extensions program</a> are safe and trusted add-ons. They are ones that are not abusing the add-on permissions. </li><li> I'm not entirely sure about what you mean by ""contributions"". My assumption is that you are talking about donations. Many add-ons do collect donations to fund their efforts. Add-ons are designed and released for free to Firefox. Many developers also have websites that they run, where they may offer a download link to the add-on and have their own donation platform. </li><li> If an update for any add-on is released and it requires new permissions, you will be asked to approve the new permissions <u>before</u> the extension gets updated. If you don't approve the new permissions, the extension will stay at the last version. </li><li> Unfortunately, that falls on the user. You need to do research about the extension that you want to install. The Firefox add-ons platform does a pretty good job of filtering out and reviewing extensions, but ultimate responsibility falls on the user. </li><li> You'd be surprised how often an add-on requires that permission. Basically, the permission is required in order for the extension to see any of the websites that you visit. For example, I have a website blocking extension that I developed. It requires the permission so that it can view the link that's being loaded and compare it to a list of websites that the user has decided to block. Ad blockers and other content blockers work the same way. Another example would be a temperature conversion extension that I also developed. When you highlight a temperature, the extension converts it to a different unit. It needs the permission so that it can insert the required selection code into every website when it loads and so that it can view the highlighted content. </li><li> Generally, if it's listed as a permission, it's something that the developer added because they needed it. It's not very common for developers to add unnecessary permissions to their add-ons. I may be wrong about this, but I think the submission platform even warns the developer about unneeded permissions when they submitting a new version. </li></ol>  Hopefully I've answered all of your questions for you.

(Honestly, your average app for a mobile device is much scarier.) </p><p>Generally you can get a good idea on whether any developer or vendor is trustworthy (or more easily - if they are untrustworthy, as that news is louder) is to do a search and see what different sources say about the thing in question. </p> id:1282269,created:2020-01-18 05:49:52 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 05:49:52 -0800,creator:jerry_chavez,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>Wesley Branton <a href=""#answer-1282178"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I also believe that perhaps the <a href=""/en-US/kb/tips-assessing-safety-extension"" rel=""nofollow"">Tips for assessing the safety of an extension</a> page may provide some other useful information to you. </blockquote> <p>Thank you Wesley, I am most appreciative for your information and efforts in enlightening, regardless how disappointing I find the whole browser Add-ons Extensions security/privacy issue. </p> id:1282178,created:2020-01-17 19:47:47 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 19:47:47 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I also believe that perhaps the <a href=""/en-US/kb/tips-assessing-safety-extension"" rel=""nofollow"">Tips for assessing the safety of an extension</a> page may provide some other useful information to you. </p> id:1282171,created:2020-01-17 19:11:30 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 19:11:30 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Add-ons are just like any other piece of software. A regular program that you install on your computer could also access Firefox data, so you just need to be responsible when adding things to your computer. </p><p>An example that I like to sometimes show people is how easy it could be to get the password from the Facebook login page. If you go to the Facebook website (assuming you aren't logged in), you will get the login screen at the top. If you press Ctrl + Shift + K on your keyboard, you will open the Web Console, which will allow you to run code (similar to what an extension can do). If you fill in some fake login information (but don't click login) and type <code>document.getElementById('pass').value;</code> into the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> part of the Web Console and press enter it should show you what you have typed into the password field. </p><p>So, in theory, an extension <em>could</em> include the same code and run it on the Facebook page when you open it. Then, it <em>could</em> send that to the extension developer. Actually, that's basically how the builtin Firefox password manager and other password managers can collect this data to save for you (although, obviously they aren't sending the data to themselves). </p><p>I should also point out that just because a developer has added that permission to their add-on doesn't necessarily mean they are collecting anything. As a matter of fact, there are tons that don't send any data anywhere. The permission just allows the add-on to access the website content and information so that it can function properly. </p><p>While capturing passwords and other data could be a possibility, there are more legitimate developers than bad ones. </p><p>As for donations, many developers do use the donation button on their add-on listing page. The issue is that the add-ons page only supports a limited number of payment processors (<a href=""http://buymeacoffee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">buymeacoffee.com</a>, <a href=""http://donate.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">donate.mozilla.org</a>, <a href=""http://flattr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">flattr.com</a>, <a href=""http://liberapay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">liberapay.com</a>, <a href=""http://micropayment.de"" rel=""nofollow"">micropayment.de</a>, <a href=""http://opencollective.com"" rel=""nofollow"">opencollective.com</a>, <a href=""http://patreon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">patreon.com</a>, <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> and <a href=""http://paypal.me"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.me</a> at the moment). So, if the developer wants to use a different payment processor (perhaps one that offers lower fees), they need to have a donation page outside of Mozilla. </p><p>It's not necessarily bad. Usually they will use an assortment of processors, since the people donating to them may also have ones that they prefer over others. Provided the developer is using a trusted and safe platform, there's not really much need for concern. </p> id:1282133,created:2020-01-17 15:57:43 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 15:57:43 -0800,creator:jerry_chavez,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>Wesley Branton <a href=""#answer-1282112"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I myself am an add-on developer, so I'll try to answer all of your questions above to the best of my ability for you.

I no longer see this information and have to open the actual item page to see this info.  This is exclusive to Firefox (and it only just started) as I downloaded and tested this feature on OPERA, CHROME and EDGE, this morning, Jan. 17, 2020.  I use EBAY every day and this lack of information on the search results page is a deal breaker.  I've been patient hoping it would resolve. I have always preferred Firefox as my browser but if this can't be fixed I will have to switch to another browser.  I've attached a photo of the same item on all four browsers and you can see the two on the right do not show the shipping amount, this is from the FIREFOX browser.

I have had an ff account for a long time and used sync; been a ff user since the beginning.  About a year and a half ago, I had to switch to Chrome because of an ff runaway memory problem that I was unable to fix.  I upgraded the desktop from Win 7 to Win 10 last December and early this January I made the switch back to ff by creating a new profile and importing the Chrome data via the ""Import data from another browser"".  I cleaned up the Chrome data and saved to html file for backup.  Each time I tried to get sync working sync would create/add/duplicate bookmarks which led me to this post.  Each time I try sync and it creates this mess, I delete all the bookmarkbackups directory files and delete places.sqlite and import my saved html file, which is where I am now. </p><p>As you can see in my quoted post, I have changed my account password with absolutely no change to the sync behavior, not the expected result given that the password is used to generate the access key.  So, either that assumption is incorrect and the sync data is still there OR it did delete all existing account sync data and the data is coming from somewhere else.  Either way I would really like to solve this problem.  I appreciate everyones help here. </p> id:1282868,created:2020-01-20 08:16:57 -0800,updated:2020-01-20 08:16:57 -0800,creator:dmcmillen,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Well, today there is only ""Web Session, Firefox 72, Current session"" and ""Web Session, Firefox 72, 21 hours ago"" both with the option to disconnect.

En la versión 70.0.1 al iniciar sesión se sincronizaba el historial, marcadores y varios datos más, al salir o cerrar sesión todo, completamente todo se eliminaba, es decir, me dejaba el navegador limpio, como si no lo hubiera usado, eso para mí es muy importante debido a que en otras ocasiones ingresaron a mis redes sociales usando este equipo y con la versión 70.0.1 todo iba muy bien, me sentía seguro. Con la nueva actualización la versión 72.0.1 esto no sucede, se puede cerrar sesión pero me manda un mensaje que dice: “Firefox se desconectará de tu cuenta, pero no eliminará los datos de navegación en este dispositivo”. Esto para mi representa una gran desventaja, ya que prefiero seguir manteniendo mi privacidad sobre que sitios visito, las contraseñas que introduzco y hasta los sitios que tengo guardado en “marcadores”, en mi trabajo ya me abrieron mi equipo físicamente varias veces y buscan mucha información en los navegadores. Mi pregunta es: ¿hay alguna forma de cerrar la sesión de Firefox Sync y al cerrar que borre historial y marcadores además de otros datos? Que lo deje limpio como si fuera la instalación original.  </p><p>Gracias por su ayuda. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-720;desktop;windows-10;needsinfo;,firefox,bookmarks,es,1281832;1281999;1282440;1323540;,gabzavram,"id:1323540,created:2020-06-13 04:26:35 -0800,updated:2020-06-13 04:26:35 -0800,creator:armandoreyesreyes901,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>“Firefox se desconectará de tu cuenta, pero no eliminará los datos de navegación en este dispositiv </p> id:1282440,created:2020-01-18 17:33:44 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 17:33:44 -0800,creator:pcp04,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Gracias por compartir!, solo necesitaríamos que coloques esta consulta como solucionada y indicando la respuesta elegida como solución. ¡Gracias! </p> id:1281999,created:2020-01-17 08:37:16 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 08:37:16 -0800,creator:gabzavram,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>si funcionó, muchas gracias por la ayuda. </p><p>Saludos. </p> id:1281832,created:2020-01-16 17:01:23 -0800,updated:2020-01-16 17:01:23 -0800,creator:pcp04,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Hola,  Entiendo que hubo problemas con esta funcionalidad: desde usuarios que borraban sus datos sin querer, usuarios que pensaban que borraba los datos del Servidor de Sync a usuarios a los que no se le borraba los datos.

I bet that it was something like that causing the browser to switch, as in the browser cache for <a href=""http://route66mc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com</a> was remembering the redirect to https://www.route66mc. and I looked for browser cache only in https://route66mc </p> id:1303177,created:2020-04-06 17:10:07 -0800,updated:2020-04-06 17:10:07 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Hi firefox195, if I try the URL you seem to be referring to in the original screenshot -- </p><p><a href=""http://route66mc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com/</a> </p><p>-- the server immediately sends a  </p><p><code>301 Moved Permanently</code> </p><p>response code with </p><p><code>Location: <a href=""https://route66mc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://route66mc.com/</a></code> </p><p>as the new URL Firefox should load instead. </p><p>So the http =&gt; https redirect is coming from the web server.

If you are using anything other than <strong>Standard</strong>, Firefox may be blocking cookies. There is a <strong>Manage exceptions...</strong> button there where you can view the list of exceptions. </p><p>Then, if you scroll down to the <strong>Cookies and Site Data</strong> section, there's also a <strong>Manage Permissions</strong> button there. That will provide you a list of websites that have special permissions or have been blocked. You can try removing the website(s) in question from the list if they are blocked or you can also try adding an allow permission for the website(s). </p><p>Finally, you should check the <strong>History</strong> section of the settings. If you have set Firefox to <strong>Never remember history</strong>, it's likely that your cookies are not being saved. </p><p>If you have the <strong>Use custom settings for history</strong> option selected along with the <strong>Clear history when Firefox closes</strong> option, it's possible that Firefox is erasing your saved logins and cookies when you close it. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

This is why I'm still running the older version of Firefox as I update my system with the auto updates only as manual updates with Linux can sometimes be problematic and I am not very tech savvy. I've called RBC a couple of times and they said they were working on the problem but they mainly just blamed Firefox saying Firefox is being  very ""slow"" about resolving the issue at their end. Since I run an older version of Firefox and am having the same issue as users with the newest Firefox it seems logical that the problem is with the bank and not the browser.  </p><p>I should mention the problem started for me only 3 or 4 days ago, however the message to clients started appearing on the RBC website at least a week prior. I did not have any problems logging on at that point so I assumed it was an issue limited to users of the newest Firefox version and since I ran version 66, it didn't apply.

It is a twisty trail, but my conclusion after several hours of digging was that SPDY is a fully-deprecated predecessor to HTTP2. All the major browsers, I believe including Firefox, have now dropped support of SPDY in favor of HTTP2. I believe the appearance of ""spdy"" in the Firefox about:config network preferences is legacy from when SPDY was available but HTTP2 was not yet stable/deployed. So all those preferences that used to relate to SPDY now relate to HTTP2, but the legacy terminology (confusingly) remains ... </p> </blockquote> <p>@Beady - Thank you for taking the time to elaborate. </p>"

Launching an executable from the downloads list may modify the privileges of the launched program, which could affect the parts of disk where it is allowed to open files from. For example, Firefox normally runs with reduced privileges when UAC is set normally, so when you launch a PDF into Adobe Reader from the downloads list, Adobe Reader inherits those reduced privileges. If UAC is not set to its default setting or various programs are run as administrator, there may be a mismatch of privileges.

As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser, as when I checked Waterfox Classic (The only version I could see offered when I went to check the site to get the browser) to see if those problems followed to it, I learned it did not. However for some reason, Waterfox does not have access to the same extensions I normally use in Firefox. Is there a reason behind this? I am planning to downgrade to the immediate preceeding version of Firefox I have to see if that fixes the issues there but I somehow doubt it.

My biggest issue was just why that distortion was happening and why it took so long to happen if it was a driver update issue. In any case, aside from playback being a little less sharp on lower resolution videos, which is a small price to pay, this appears to be fixed, and hopefully it will remain that way.

Curiously enough that appears to have worked. I'm not sure <em>why</em>, but it seems to have fixed the playback issues. It now looks effectively identical to how it used to before, if slightly a bit grainier on netflix but I can live with that. If hardware acceleration isn't required, then I can leave it off, I would assume? I dunno if it worked because I told Firefox not to restore the previous session when I restarted this time or not. But if that is the cure for my issue, Then I'm happy about that. Uhm, would this be something I should check again next time a graphics card driver update goes through? This was very random that it should happen a few days after I updated the drivers rather than the day of.

So I assumed the two share the same help area, if nothing else. I was under the impression that the two programs used similar construction, so I was surprised to see a lack of an adblock or noscript listing when I went onto their own add-on section. Wikipedia also mentions that legacy add-ons and the like are allowed on the browser, so I figured adblock Plus should be there if nothing else. </p><p>Which reminds me, what is the difference between Waterfox and Waterfox Classic? Is there one or are they making a reference to something there?  </p><p>Ah well. Does anyone know what's causing the video playback issues when in fullscreen mode for the sites I mentioned having issues with? It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop. Again, Waterfox shows no sign of this issue in any form, so far as I can discern.  </p><p>I have tried to get a picture of the distortions I'm seeing, but when videos are paused, the distortion vanishes, and even trying to do a print screen shot while the video is in motion results in a complete lack of said distortion showing up in the pictures, no matter how hard I try. This just started randomly happening on Monday Night around between 8 and 9 at night. Prior to that it had been working properly.

So I assumed the two share the same help area, if nothing else. I was under the impression that the two programs used similar construction, so I was surprised to see a lack of an adblock or noscript listing when I went onto their own add-on section. Wikipedia also mentions that legacy add-ons and the like are allowed on the browser, so I figured adblock Plus should be there if nothing else. </p><p>Which reminds me, what is the difference between Waterfox and Waterfox Classic? Is there one or are they making a reference to something there?  </p><p>Ah well. Does anyone know what's causing the video playback issues when in fullscreen mode for the sites I mentioned having issues with? It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop. Again, Waterfox shows no sign of this issue in any form, so far as I can discern.  </p><p>I have tried to get a picture of the distortions I'm seeing, but when videos are paused, the distortion vanishes, and even trying to do a print screen shot while the video is in motion results in a complete lack of said distortion showing up in the pictures, no matter how hard I try. This just started randomly happening on Monday Night around between 8 and 9 at night. Prior to that it had been working properly. Nothing I do seems to work, and while Waterfox doesn't seem to be suffering from the issue, I'm not sure if reverting to Firefox 71 is worth it since if it doesn't work, that's just time wasted.

I switched to Surface Go and viola, page appeared as it should. </p><p>Now the question is why I had to do this and what are the ramifications of my using my Custom Device with deficient Agent String? </p><p>Also, does this mean Firefox was reporting device specs incorrectly or is NYT getting specs incorrectly?

The problem is this; when I reopen firefox after either  A) having shut down my laptop, or  B) having simply 'quit' firefox,  I must enter my email address and password again, then enter my phone number so that it can send me a text to the link to the firefox app for my phone (which I have installed), then finally I can navigate firefox as normal and my websites and history are remembered. However, it is not really ""as normal"" because I have to SIGN INTO the websites again. Sometimes it remembers the username and password and all I have to do is click through it, but sometimes it doesn't and I have to manually sign into them. Bookmarks aren't ever saved either. I have attached the screenshot of the screen that comes up every time I reopen firefox and this problem happens. I did not have this problem on my older firefox instillation, just when I updated to the newest version. It is so irritating.

I run these relevant tests immediately upon bringing up a new incidence of Firefox since that is when the huge accumulations have been sabotaging the operability of everything else on my computer.  The point is that until the garbled v72.0.1, I could always rely on Firefox to zero out the entire cache.  I should not now be compelled, after years of proper operation of the program, to go through three wrist painful clicks to get the thing to finally get around to clearing its accumulated GARBAGE.  Your reference to a ""doomed"" folder has no equivalent on my Windows 7 computer.  It isn't that I'm short on disk space, it is that v72.0.1 of Firefox is accumulating SO MUCH GARBAGE and refusing to clear it that the cache is interfering with even bringing up other programs.  Your assertion that a full GIGABYTE of GARBAGE or large MEGABYTES of such ""are not going to interfere with the operation of other programs"" is contradicted by my real world experience which has repeatedly shown that Firefox's recently inflicted refusal to clear cache is in fact sabotaging my entire computer, even requiring a warm reboot to get anything else to run.  Incidentally I have tried several of the self styled ""clear cache"" addons or extensions and absolutely none of them comes anywhere close to clearing the garbage collection.  Only the five painful clicks using my long since crippled wrists to get to and via the Options/Privacy and Security area has been able to get rid of the garbage which Firefox insists on accumulating and RECENTLY BEGAN REFUSING TO CLEAR. </p> id:1282134,created:2020-01-17 15:59:27 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 15:59:27 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Ha, i usually use about:blank myself.

How are you determining the size of the cache remained after clearing?  You don't have to wait for cache to clear at shutdown, you can clear it any time. Make sure you have no other web pages open other than your Preferences page, or a blank page when clearing cache, as an open page cannot be cleared.  </p><p>There are multiple ways to access the Clear History. You seem to favor opening Preferences → Privacy and Security.  Once you click on Clear History, you have choices. Make sure at least that Cache is checked, and the Time Range to Clear is set to Everything. Click Clear Now.   </p><p>At no time do i get a size report of anything. Checking folders under /Cache2 gives me an empty /entries folder and about 2.2MB in /doomed folder. </p><p>If your excessive cache storage is in the /doomed folder, yes this could be a problem. This is supposed to be for open/active pages, including the Firefox Home or any home page. These are set to be deleted, but <em>when</em> is not specified - apparently not very soon at all in some cases. (This is even listed as a bug, as it should be.) This, however, has been the behavior for years, so i do not know if it addresses your issue. You can manually delete these if Firefox is closed, if it helps. </p><p>If you type about:cache in the address bar and Enter, in the Disk section you can see the location of your cache2 folder, and also list any cache entries. </p><p>A last thought: Unless you are radically short on disk space, application temporary caches are not going to interfere with the operation of other programs.  This doesn't excuse Firefox if it is misbehaving, but it does point to an issue that a change to Firefox will not fix. </p> id:1281249,created:2020-01-15 07:50:42 -0800,updated:2020-01-15 07:50:42 -0800,creator:bobgru,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>@crankygoat Your suggestion to check the Task Manager/Processes was a good one so I brought up the Task Manager (always set to Processes anyway since that's the only relevant aspect) then brought up Firefox.  There were four processes shown as ""firefox.exe"" in the list while Firefox was running.  They all disappeared instantly when I exited Firefox so our (yes I was wondering about that too) suspicion about belated exit wasn't borne out.  As for the notion of ""already been fetched from the web"", unless Firefox has been redefined in such a way as to go out on its own (my home page is ""about:blank"") to gather trash from the wubb, the notion of having ""already"" gathered garbage doesn't hold.  The baseline 26.0 Kb appears to be only Firefox's *own* use of cache.  It's the MEGABYTES of *carryover* garbage, reaching a full GIGABYTE at one time early in this inquiry process, that are my concern.  It's quite clear that the cache is *not* being overwritten and that the sabotaging of bringing up any other program after Firefox *leaves* it excessively large is THE PROBLEM.  I looked into my installation records and unfortunately didn't record the v72.0.1 ""upgrade"".  Last one I did record was v71.0 in the week ending 191206.  So my bottom line remains that a DEFECT WAS INTRODUCED during the ""upgrade"" to v72.0.1 which defeats the years and years of proper operation clearing cache upon exit. </p> id:1281102,created:2020-01-14 20:30:46 -0800,updated:2020-01-14 20:30:46 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Controlling P-i-P: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox</a> </p> <blockquote> When I exit Firefox and twiddle my thumbs for awhile, then fire it up again to check Options\Privacy &amp; Security, I'm still finding as much as MEGABYTES of garbage that haven't been cleared from my cache. </blockquote> <p>You might check in Task Manager, Processes tab, to ensure all the Firefox processes have terminated.

Fact is until a couple of weeks ago, I never had any of these problems.  The only problem that has been cleared away is the obnoxious, never authorized by me to be installed at all on my computer, ""picture in a picture"" function which was inflicting its disruptions on every video that I attempted to stream until I accidentally ran across it and shut it off during my scramblings to try to resolve this apparent new defect in the way that Firefox operates.  That was no ""improvement"" but a major imposition on Firefox afficianados such as myself.

Firefox has been acting strange lately. Opened up the package contents of the app (on macbook pro 2012) and saw a chrome manifest folder that seemed to be blocking web access on certain sites. Using a similar computer (with ff installed) and decided to look in the app folder. I saw a blocklist.xml sheet. Wondering if this is something that should be in there by default? Some of the things on the list, are things that i'd more likely need than not need. Here is a list of blocked sites and ip addresses.

The GUI simply stales as nothing happened.  To reproduce: 1. Configure FF with an HTTP proxy (squid) in deny by default. 2. Open duckduckgo, search something, and click on any https link that has not been whitelisted in the proxy. 3. After the click, nothing happens -&gt; no error, no information message, nothing. (in the dev tools -&gt; network tab, one can see a 403 status.) </p><p>This also happens when browsing websites: if the website includes a link to another website that is not whitelisted, nothing happens, the user is not informed that the host could not be reached. </p><p>This seems like a mechanism has been broken, as FF always used to inform the user of the host not responding with an error page. </p><p>Thanks for reading, sb3k </p>",firefox-720;desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1280116;1280269;,mozilla.org8,"id:1280269,created:2020-01-11 21:56:51 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 21:56:51 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>What if you try some return codes here: <a href=""https://httpstat.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://httpstat.us/</a> You can append your desired status code to the URL or pick from a list on the default landing page. </p><p>I get a very small, e.g., 403 Forbidden in the upper left.

There isn't always, so it may not be there for you. </p><p>To open your profile folder, go to the <code>about:profiles</code> page in Firefox. If you have more than one profile listed there, one of them will say <strong>This is the profile in use...</strong> so that's the profile that you are using. In the <strong>Root Directory</strong> row of that table, there will be a path name along with a <strong>Open Folder</strong> button. Press that button. </p><p>That will open the folder in your computer's file explorer. Look for a <code>user.js</code> file. If you find one, change the file name to <code>user-old.js</code>. </p><p>Now, regardless of whether or not you had that file in your folder, go back to Firefox and go to the <code>about:config</code> page. There might be a security warning that you need to bypass.

It will then give time to the developers of this extension to make the proper changes and release a new version. </p> id:1279822,created:2020-01-10 05:18:08 -0800,updated:2020-01-10 05:18:08 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>How do you completely turn off update checks in Firefox v64?

Try starting with only ""Tabs on Bottom"" code in userChrome.css and add back other code until it breaks, again. </li><li> You are starting a different profile for Private Browsing.

The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).

Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks. Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc. </p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section. </p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites. Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks. This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find. It may also be a government imposed function. Either one. </p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ? </p><p>WTF ? I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ? What the hell are you talking about ? YOu care about my privacy ?

Then they removed that setting, citing the upcoming deprecation of Flash as justification ... even though that isn't going to happen until the beginning of 2021. Because every website that uses Flash is on their own internal timetable to replace it with whatever is appropriate in HTML5, this means every time I access a site that hasn't upgraded yet, I have to authorize Firefox to run Flash via the pull-down from the address bar.  EVERY SINGLE TIME. </p><p>It happens that there are four sites I visit daily, in order to play Hidato, Sudoku, Jumble, and the like.  I have been visiting those sites for literally years.  They pose no security threat, yet they are probably going to be staying in Flash until almost the last minute, because those online puzzles are going to be difficult to replicate in HTML5.  I have asked -- multiple times -- for a relatively simple fix, which is to modify the pull-down to allow Firefox to ""remember"" my decision to allow <strong>only for that site</strong>. </p><p>All I get in return is ""we did this because Flash is going away"" ... well, yes, I have acknowledged that every time.  But they acted more than a year before that was going to be an issue, they have inconvenienced every user who has a circumstance like mine, and now we are at FF72 and guess what still hasn't been addressed by them. </p><p>I'm going to keep complaining about this until either they put in a temporary fix (which, of course, would be removed along with Flash support itself a year from now) or time runs out.  I figure that if they can't be responsive, they deserve to be called out on it as often as they put out a release that doesn't address this simple, basic problem <strong>which they created and now apparently refuse to fix</strong>. </p><p>Corrupt?

I'll click on a page to load it, then the black 'finding' dot on the tab will bobble about a bit, then it turns to the blue 'connecting' dot and keeps loading for minutes. At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up '<a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a>' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following: </p><p>Looking up <a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://fonts.googleapis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">fonts.googleapis.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com</a> Read <a href=""http://s.salecycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">s.salecycle.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com</a> Looking up (numbers and letters).cloudfront.net Looking up <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> TLS handshake with <a href=""http://i.salecycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">i.salecycle.com</a> Sending <a href=""http://i.salecycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">i.salecycle.com</a> Looking up <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> Waiting for <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> </p><p>I don't have this problem with anything else connected to the network - I tested the WiFi connection just now on my Xbox and got 35.73, 34.31 and 35.94mb/s, but trying to load <a href=""http://broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk</a> on Firefox took 16m 13s just to load the page, and it's not even got near to starting the test.

If it's too far off this topic, I can repost it as a separate question. </p><p>For some time, my Firefox profile has had a userChrome.css file containing tabs on the bottom code, which worked.  I don't know what other code was in the file.  However, after a while, as Firefox updated before version 71, Firefox's tabs began to crash unpredictably and with increasing frequency when connected to the web.  Nearly every time, after a few tab crashes, other programs open on my Windows 10 computer would freeze and/or I would get a black screen or both.  Restarting Firefox and/or the computer did not help for long.  Creating a new profile and copying the bookmarks and other existing personalized data files to the new profile also did not help. </p><p>After I installed version 71, I made the needed changes in userChrome.css to keep tabs on the bottom working, and the crashes stopped.  When 72 arrived, tabs on the bottom stopped.  I was unable to get them working again until after 72.01 installed and I installed tabs on the bottom code only.  However, the freeze, etc. problems have started again.  Are a file or files in my Firefox profile the culprit(s)? </p> id:1280022,created:2020-01-11 00:28:00 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 00:28:00 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>It looks that it is possible to modify the current code and replace :root with *|*:root through out the tabs on bottom CSS code. </p> id:1279911,created:2020-01-10 12:40:47 -0800,updated:2020-01-10 12:40:47 -0800,creator:phumphries,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I am glad to have been of help, and, of course, the code is a compilation of many contributors' work. </p> id:1279910,created:2020-01-10 12:33:45 -0800,updated:2020-01-10 12:33:45 -0800,creator:MauriceFLesses,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Peter, your code worked.

I think .json are and a few others I recognize but it looks like there are thousands of files here and I don't want to recover everything as my hard drive will be filled.   </p><p>And how do I prevent my (small) C drive from filling up in the Users area?  I have the browser installed on D drive but I can't remember if I attempted to install it as a portable installation.

Fix might also involve clearing some telstra-related cookies, because I did that too, but that seems less likely. </p><p>Summary: turns out that Telstra's routers have some ""captive portal"" functionality that they use surreptitiously as a ""malware prevention"" mechanism.  They can (and do, apparently) dynamically black-hole some IP addresses, or perhaps DNS lookups.  Looks as though stale information in that list managed to collide with Firefox's local detectportal Akamai service.  Telstra's on-line chat and telephone support operators were completely ineffectual in diagnosing this, by the way.  Both gave up.  The second advised strongly <em>against</em> rebooting the router.  Sigh.  I'm fairly sure that if the modem still had its default LAN configuration settings, the mymodem.modem URL would have resolved to it, but it doesn't, and my highest priority DNS is google's IPv6 one, I think, so that doesn't resolve to anything. </p><p>Router restart did ""fix"" the problem though. </p><p>It would be nice if the network.captive-portal-service.enabled frob could be exposed as a settings knob.  This desktop machine isn't going to move to a captive portal at any time, so doesn't need to do the check that triggered the fault.  Wouldn't want to share that with synch services though. </p><p>Thanks for listening! </p>"

I added this question to my watch list because I was looking for some more information for you. </p><p>The <strong>Colors</strong> options in the Firefox settings are global settings, meaning that they will apply to every website. If you are looking to only adjust the background colour for the <code>about:blank</code> page, you will likely have more luck adding a <code>userContent.css</code> file to Firefox. </p><p>The <code>userContent.css</code> file allows you to customize the content that Firefox displays to you, so it can be used to customize the <code>about:blank</code> background colour. </p><p>You will need to use the following code: </p> <pre>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:blank) {     * {         background: black !important;     } }</pre> <p>If you don't already have a <code>userContent.css</code> file in Firefox (which you likely don't), you need to make one. This is done by first creating a <code>chrome</code> folder in your <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox profile folder</a> (if it doesn't already exist). In there is where you create your <code>userChrome.css</code> file, which can be done with a text editor like Windows Notepad. </p><p>Alternatively, I've <a href=""https://send.firefox.com/download/6474a8983f7fb1b6/#Z4yU2BCU4-u90uMOG0fxJQ"" rel=""nofollow"">uploaded a copy of the userContent.css file that you can download</a> and paste into the <code>chrome</code> folder. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The download link is only valid for 7 days. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1279765,created:2020-01-09 18:22:08 -0800,updated:2020-01-09 18:22:08 -0800,creator:acartriana,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>No one would respond, so I finally deleted my FF browser and reinstall it.  </p><p>Pro: My concern over the loss of toolbar sites &amp; bookmarks was wasted energy.

I have researched the support threads here and I feel the start of weird Sync issues which seemed to have began 4 1/2 years ago when the Sync feature was modified during the latter Beta stage of development with the Firefox for iOS app - like in May or June 2015. Only users who have connected a ""mobile device"" seem to have the ""duplication of bookmarks"" fault; in a few cases it was dozens or even over 100 sets of duplicates for users who were slow to catch on that there was a problem.  I am hoping that this ""mobile device"" issue will be solved shortly as Mozilla releases new versions of the Firefox mobile web browser app. </p> <hr> <p>In conclusion, if you try to manually repair the 'carnage' by all means <strong>dis-Connect</strong> from Sync on the laptop/desktop devices before deleting any of the duplicate sets of bookmarks.
