It may be Joomla itself, although this does not explain why automatic login is possible if cookies are never cleared. Everything i could find regarding Joomla logins is old, and of course, it depends entirely on how the administrator has configured Joomla on the server. Theoretically, if the Joomla login box does not have a ""Remember me"" check box, one should never be able to login automatically.

1277817,2020-01-20 11:46:17 -0800,2020-01-22T21:58:52Z,How can I keep Whatsapp.web connected even when I close Firefox?,"<p>I am using the currect version of FF, 71 or 70. something, not sure but I just updated. I use Whatsapp.web to chat when on my PC. I have no trouble connecting to Whatsapp.web using my Iphone and Firefox. However, EVERY time that FF closes, for a restart, or simply when I make a mistake and accidentally close the browser, the connection to Whatsapp.web is apparently broken. I say apparently because on the Iphone, it sontinues to list Windows 10 as an active device using the web app. When I used Microsoft Edge, once I scanned the QR code and connected, I would STAY connected, even overnight after I had shut down the PC. I am wondering if there are certain privacy or security settings which are preventing Whatsapp from staying connected when the FF browser closes. I also remember that a couple of years ago, when I was using FF in the 40s versions, maybe, Whatsapp also stayed connected. Just a note: the reason this is sort of a problem for me is that I am blind, and I use certain visual accessibility settings on Windows and FF that do not allow the Whatsapp QR to be scanned; so I have to change the entirevisual setting of my PC, scan the code, then restore the entire visual setting. Any ideas how to keep Whatsapp.web connected always, or at least as long as I don't end my Windows session? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-720;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1283122;1283196;1283402;1283485;1283541;1283610;1283719;,greene8097,"id:1283719,created:2020-01-22 21:58:52 -0800,updated:2020-01-22 21:58:52 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I hope this works better in the future.

I downloaded the latest version and at the end of install - where 'run firefox' is expected - nothing happened. I have since uninstalled and downloaded the latest beta version (73) - and now, when I ask to run the program, it opens a window but all the tabs are 'dead' and no matter what I type, the program does not connect to the internet (i.e. Google search or direct to a known web address). If I select settings, I can see the drop-down list - but if I select 'Add-ons' (for example) - nothing happens.

It's normal for it to suggest a different email domain when using a non-standard email address, but I don't think it actually blocks you from sending it. </p><p>If it's actually being sent, have you checked your junk/spam folder? Certain email providers have strict filters, so perhaps the email is being blocked entirely. You can try adding the <code>accounts@firefox.com</code> to your address book/contacts, since this normally makes it a trusted email for your account. </p><p>Also, you'll want to disable any automated replies or vacation notifications, since the Firefox Account system usually treats those as errors. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

I have 500/500mbps fios, but for some reason, my downloads all download at about 700kbps and my uploads max out at about 7mbps. However, if i use chrome then the problem disappears (sort of, i still only get 200mbps max upload/download speeds). Ive already tried clearing my cookies/cache. and restarting Firefox. The issue is not with a certain website, but with all download/uploads across the board. The weird part is that i can upload several files and each will upload at 7mbps per file but they will never go above 7mbps. ive tried disabling my add-ons and nothing changes. If i check my internet speed on firefox, i do get 500/500 speeds, so i dont know what it could be. its not a big deal to have to switch to chrome whenever i want to upload/download something, but its something id rather not have to do. ive been using firefox for as long as i can remember and ive never had an issue like this. </p><p>Im using task managers performance tab to see the upload speed and using firefox's download icon to see the download speed. </p>",firefox-720;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1282511;1282752;,shadowkon626,"id:1282752,created:2020-01-19 18:02:10 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 18:02:10 -0800,creator:shadowkon626,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>that doesnt help at all, i still want to upload things. </p> id:1282511,created:2020-01-19 00:40:53 -0800,updated:2020-01-19 00:40:53 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Go to the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Add-ons Web Page</a> {web Link} (There’s a lot of good stuff here) and search for a download manager. </p>"

1277697,2020-01-18 18:17:50 -0800,2020-01-18T21:44:29Z,Video playback issues,"<p>I am currently having issues with Youtube, Netflix, and <a href=""http://vrv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">vrv.co</a>, all video streaming sites over on Firefox, though only in full screen mode, and only on those particular video streaming sites, and I don't know why. As everything else works perfectly fine on my computer otherwise. Though curiously, running the browser in safe mode seems to remove those issues. However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser. Strangely, safe mode removes the issue, but again, not sure why. I did check another browser— Namely Waterfox Classic. That worked fine. And so far the only suggestion anyone has had from the tech service that I have on the machine has made that makes sense is that this might be a video driver issue. I did just recently update my drivers, this is true. However the issue did not start up until a few days after this had occurred. I tried reinstalling the driver to see if that would fix the issue.  The issue itself is very weird. It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop.  </p><p>Again, Waterfox does not seem to have this issue. At first it was suggested to me on another thread that the issue might be because Waterfox Classic doesn't use hardware acceleration, so I turned that off on Firefox. Which does allow things to play more or less okay, though at times when I scroll, it seems to mess with the screen in a similar fashion to the initial playback issues, and again, it's not consistent with that, just like it's not consistent with the video playback when the browser's Hardware acceleration is on. </p><p>However, I just learned that Waterfox Classic /does/ use hardware acceleration, though it seems to have a much lower content limit set by default. This makes me think that whatever is going on may be a glitch in Firefox itself that may have somehow come up. Though how and why I have no earthly clue, as prior to last Monday there was no issue, as I said earlier. More unusually sometimes the effect vanishes on videos where it's shown up.  </p><p>I have tried to screenhot this and it /never/ appears in screenshots, and doesn't show up when paused either. I've even tried to take a picture of it with my phone or record it with said. Also no luck. I /have/ however, been able to find a video that does this affect deliberately, so I can at least present it here. Again, this is not consistent, seems to move around the screen, and only seems to occur on those three video sites as I stated. Apparently whatever the issue is, it's /NOT/ something to do with the hardware acceleration, as I learned, again, that WaterfoxClassic /does/ use it and it is active in that browser, and was active when I first tried it, so that narrows it down to some kind of glitch either with Firefox or Windows and how it interacts with either the former or the latter, depending on where the glitch is coming from.  </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's causing this? </p><p>The image attached is an example of what I'm seeing, however, bear in mind that this video is /deliberately/ showing this effect in an attempt to replicate the type of thing one might see on old video tapes being played after years of disuse, but it /is/ the same general appearance, more or less, of what I occasionally see on Firefox when using the videos on the above mentioned sites. </p>",other;firefox-720;desktop;firefox-7201;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1282463;1282466;1282470;1282478;1282482;1282485;,Marc7,"id:1282485,created:2020-01-18 21:44:29 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 21:44:29 -0800,creator:Marc7,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>crankygoat <a href=""#answer-1282482"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled   -- I am not an expert on the Web APIs for media or anything else, but my guess is whether or not what capabilities the display reports are used along with other factors (the ability to decode the input, etc.) to determine what format video to send.

We learned that turning off the hardware acceleration seemed to be the best option when I brought the issue up in another thread, one related to Waterfox when I ended up getting sent to this help forum when I clicked on Waterfox Help after downloading Waterfox Classic. Not sure what actually makes it 'classic' compared to whatever is regular Waterfox. But yeah, someone had suggested turning off the extensions one at a time, and seeing if any of them was the cause of the issue. Now unless I did it wrong, as I would turn one off, restart the browser, and if nothing had changed, I would turn that back on and repeat the process with the other two, none of the extensions seem to be the problem. I was even able to test adblock plus on Waterfox Classic, and that clearly was not the <a href=""http://issue.No"" rel=""nofollow"">issue.No</a> script didn't have a counterpart that worked on it, and my Webroot filtering extension doesn't even come up on the thing. Plus, none of those had ever been a problem on Firefox up until last Monday at around 8 or 9 pm eastern standard time. Prior to that, everything had worked fine. I had updated Firefox to version 72.0.1 just a few days before, and also updated my graphics card's drivers, and the day after, I had just put through the latest optional update to Windows 10. So at least we can rule the latter out as the problem.  </p><p>Like I said, I have little idea what even caused the issue to begin with.  </p><p>Oh, if it helps, my video card is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965m. </p> id:1282482,created:2020-01-18 21:33:39 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 21:33:39 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>media.media-capabilites.screen.enabled   -- I am not an expert on the Web APIs for media or anything else, but my guess is whether or not what capabilities the display reports are used along with other factors (the ability to decode the input, etc.) to determine what format video to send.

It also means I face a similar issue when scrolling— though again much like with the video playback this is entirely inconsistent, but that may just be the price of having video working without using a different browser.  And again, last week it was perfectly fine. Though to be fair, I believe I was on either version 71 or 72 of Firefox rather than 72.0.1 at that time, as I did an update to 72.0.1 a few days before this glitch started up.

The easiest way to do this is to go to the <code>about:support</code> page by typing that into the Firefox address bar. On that page, in the <strong>Applications Basics</strong> table, there is a <strong>Profile Folder</strong> row. If you press the <strong>Open Folder</strong> button in that row. </p><p>That should open the profile folder using the regular file browser on your computer. This is the folder were all of your bookmarks and other information is saved for Firefox to use. However, this is the folder that was cleared out when you refreshed Firefox. Leave this open so that you know where to find it. </p><p>Next, go to your desktop and open that <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder. In there are some of the old files from before you refreshed Firefox. Most notably, you should see a file called <code>places.sqlite</code> in that folder. That's the file that your bookmarks and history is saved into. </p><p>Now, it's going to depend on what you want to save. If you are only looking to save the bookmarks you had in Firefox, you can just copy the <code>places.sqlite</code> file from the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder and paste it into the profile folder (what we opened from the <code>about:support</code> page earlier). </p><p>If you want to try and recover everything you had before, you can copy the entire contents of the <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder into your Firefox profile folder. </p><p>When copying stuff over, you will probably be asked if you want to overwrite files. If you have nothing on the current Firefox that you are running, you can overwrite everything without any issues.

I can live with the silly warning that Firefox is ""slow loadIng"".  What saves me from other similar situations is mostly that I keep all of my relevant bookmarks on external .htm pages and only those ""file:///c:/[groupname]/[filename].htm"" references are included in my bookmarks.  So I click on the group identifier in my bookmarks line, locate the specific site that I want to visit, and off I go.  This procedure is largely because I have HUGE NUMBERS of sites that I want to visit from time to time for various ""group"" reasons and I'm really not interested in sharing the multitudinous lists with anybody who might have access to my Firefox browser.  It's also because there are soooo many such sites that a Bookmarks line could not even conceivably show even the most important ones.  This is just a thought on how things ""might"" work better for you in the future. </p> id:1282391,created:2020-01-18 13:44:30 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 13:44:30 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes2,content:<p>There should be an <strong>Old Firefox Data</strong> folder on your desktop, which you can use to recover your data.

When creating my Firefox account I used one of these email addresses, and received a notification saying the verification email failed to send and was returned, and my account was locked out. Then I realized I forgot to enable the specific email address for my domain before trying to create the account, so I went and activated the correct address, tested it, and then tried logging in / creating my account again, but was just given the same 'locked out' error. </p><p>Can you guys unlock my account? I have the login information and the email address is working now, but the site just keeps saying that the verification email failed to send, instead of trying to send a new one or something. If you guys can't just unlock it, then it is fine if you can just reset it or completely remove it, so I can create it again with the same email, since the account was brand new and didn't have anything on it yet. </p>",download-and-install_1;firefox-730;beta;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1282350;1282385;1282429;,altgage,"id:1282429,created:2020-01-18 16:50:28 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 16:50:28 -0800,creator:altgage,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>cor-el <a href=""#answer-1282385"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> See: <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq</a> </li></ul>  <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li></ul> </blockquote> <p>I think it has been almost 24 hours so I guess I will try again in a little bit, but as for the other two links, I can't sign in to the account to even try those like I said in my post... </p> id:1282385,created:2020-01-18 13:35:56 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 13:35:56 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>See: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/forum-response-firefox-sync-verification-email-faq</a> </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-secondary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> </li></ul> id:1282350,created:2020-01-18 12:21:20 -0800,updated:2020-01-18 12:24:20 -0800,creator:altgage,updated_by:altgage,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Obviously it isn't the account I am posting on right now.

It took me a while to figure it out and I'm a developer who's been surfing the web since Mosaic. I found that the history is there if I look at the history tab, which is good. Even better, ""undo close tab"" resurrects the killed tab.  </p><p>But why not automatically open the page in a new tab and leave the original one open?

I can block the first few elements that make up the frame but you can see from the posted image that's as far as I get.  The frame will go black, but that;s as far as I get and the frame always reverts to what you see in the posted image.  That frame loading is a resource hog and I would like to kill it.  It just won't go away !  Have tried all the blocking options -- ""Block similar elements"" etc, but zero luck.  The frames appear to use unique identifiers that are different for every page load.

A regular program that you install on your computer could also access Firefox data, so you just need to be responsible when adding things to your computer. </p><p>An example that I like to sometimes show people is how easy it could be to get the password from the Facebook login page. If you go to the Facebook website (assuming you aren't logged in), you will get the login screen at the top. If you press Ctrl + Shift + K on your keyboard, you will open the Web Console, which will allow you to run code (similar to what an extension can do). If you fill in some fake login information (but don't click login) and type <code>document.getElementById('pass').value;</code> into the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> part of the Web Console and press enter it should show you what you have typed into the password field. </p><p>So, in theory, an extension <em>could</em> include the same code and run it on the Facebook page when you open it. Then, it <em>could</em> send that to the extension developer. Actually, that's basically how the builtin Firefox password manager and other password managers can collect this data to save for you (although, obviously they aren't sending the data to themselves). </p><p>I should also point out that just because a developer has added that permission to their add-on doesn't necessarily mean they are collecting anything. As a matter of fact, there are tons that don't send any data anywhere. The permission just allows the add-on to access the website content and information so that it can function properly. </p><p>While capturing passwords and other data could be a possibility, there are more legitimate developers than bad ones. </p><p>As for donations, many developers do use the donation button on their add-on listing page. The issue is that the add-ons page only supports a limited number of payment processors (<a href=""http://buymeacoffee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">buymeacoffee.com</a>, <a href=""http://donate.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">donate.mozilla.org</a>, <a href=""http://flattr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">flattr.com</a>, <a href=""http://liberapay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">liberapay.com</a>, <a href=""http://micropayment.de"" rel=""nofollow"">micropayment.de</a>, <a href=""http://opencollective.com"" rel=""nofollow"">opencollective.com</a>, <a href=""http://patreon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">patreon.com</a>, <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> and <a href=""http://paypal.me"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.me</a> at the moment). So, if the developer wants to use a different payment processor (perhaps one that offers lower fees), they need to have a donation page outside of Mozilla. </p><p>It's not necessarily bad. Usually they will use an assortment of processors, since the people donating to them may also have ones that they prefer over others. Provided the developer is using a trusted and safe platform, there's not really much need for concern. </p> id:1282133,created:2020-01-17 15:57:43 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 15:57:43 -0800,creator:jerry_chavez,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>Wesley Branton <a href=""#answer-1282112"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> I myself am an add-on developer, so I'll try to answer all of your questions above to the best of my ability for you.

This permission is certainly something that other people have been concerned/confused about before. </p> <ol><li> Theoretically, yes. While the extension won't have access to the past data that you've entered, it can see anything that loads on the page or is entered on the page while it's installed. There are some exceptions, like internal Firefox pages or Mozilla-owned pages, where extensions are not allowed to view the page. </li><li> No, when an extension is disabled, it's not running. Therefore, it can't see any websites. </li><li> Aside from the exceptions I mentioned in my answer to your first question, theoretically, yes. </li><li> Extensions don't have direct access to the passwords saved on Firefox, until they are entered into the website. So, if an extension is tracking a password text input box, then it could (theoretically) see the data that's entered. </li><li> Like you said, users should make sure to use add-ons they can trust. The majority of add-ons are not using this permission in a malicious way. </li><li> The add-ons in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/recommended-extensions-program"" rel=""nofollow"">Recommended Extensions program</a> are safe and trusted add-ons. They are ones that are not abusing the add-on permissions. </li><li> I'm not entirely sure about what you mean by ""contributions"". My assumption is that you are talking about donations. Many add-ons do collect donations to fund their efforts. Add-ons are designed and released for free to Firefox. Many developers also have websites that they run, where they may offer a download link to the add-on and have their own donation platform. </li><li> If an update for any add-on is released and it requires new permissions, you will be asked to approve the new permissions <u>before</u> the extension gets updated. If you don't approve the new permissions, the extension will stay at the last version. </li><li> Unfortunately, that falls on the user. You need to do research about the extension that you want to install. The Firefox add-ons platform does a pretty good job of filtering out and reviewing extensions, but ultimate responsibility falls on the user. </li><li> You'd be surprised how often an add-on requires that permission. Basically, the permission is required in order for the extension to see any of the websites that you visit. For example, I have a website blocking extension that I developed. It requires the permission so that it can view the link that's being loaded and compare it to a list of websites that the user has decided to block. Ad blockers and other content blockers work the same way. Another example would be a temperature conversion extension that I also developed. When you highlight a temperature, the extension converts it to a different unit. It needs the permission so that it can insert the required selection code into every website when it loads and so that it can view the highlighted content. </li><li> Generally, if it's listed as a permission, it's something that the developer added because they needed it. It's not very common for developers to add unnecessary permissions to their add-ons. I may be wrong about this, but I think the submission platform even warns the developer about unneeded permissions when they submitting a new version. </li></ol> <p>Hopefully I've answered all of your questions for you. If you need anything explained further or had additional questions, I'd be glad to help. </p>"

That's rather unfortunate for me, but thank you for the detailed answer nonetheless. On the surface level, the Sync feature just seemed to me like Firefox's more beefy take on Xmarks (since it syncs addons and tabs too), which I used for many years before that and it never failed me. In fact, a lot of what made FF so user friendly and customizable seems gone. I used to use an addon, that basically hid the words from a bookmark, and only showed you its favicon. That was really useful, and there was a replacement for it for the longest time, but its gone now from what I can find.  </p><p>Eh, maybe it's good I have to start fresh with my bookmarks.

I have had an ff account for a long time and used sync; been a ff user since the beginning.  About a year and a half ago, I had to switch to Chrome because of an ff runaway memory problem that I was unable to fix.  I upgraded the desktop from Win 7 to Win 10 last December and early this January I made the switch back to ff by creating a new profile and importing the Chrome data via the ""Import data from another browser"".  I cleaned up the Chrome data and saved to html file for backup.  Each time I tried to get sync working sync would create/add/duplicate bookmarks which led me to this post.  Each time I try sync and it creates this mess, I delete all the bookmarkbackups directory files and delete places.sqlite and import my saved html file, which is where I am now. </p><p>As you can see in my quoted post, I have changed my account password with absolutely no change to the sync behavior, not the expected result given that the password is used to generate the access key.  So, either that assumption is incorrect and the sync data is still there OR it did delete all existing account sync data and the data is coming from somewhere else.  Either way I would really like to solve this problem.  I appreciate everyones help here. </p> id:1282868,created:2020-01-20 08:16:57 -0800,updated:2020-01-20 08:16:57 -0800,creator:dmcmillen,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Well, today there is only ""Web Session, Firefox 72, Current session"" and ""Web Session, Firefox 72, 21 hours ago"" both with the option to disconnect.

1277505,2020-01-16 10:16:45 -0800,2020-06-13T04:26:35Z,como cerrar sesión sync y borrar historial y marcadores,"<p>Buenas tardes, tengo una duda o no encuentro la manera de hacer una función que para mí es muy importante por cuestión de seguridad de mis datos.  En la versión 70.0.1 al iniciar sesión se sincronizaba el historial, marcadores y varios datos más, al salir o cerrar sesión todo, completamente todo se eliminaba, es decir, me dejaba el navegador limpio, como si no lo hubiera usado, eso para mí es muy importante debido a que en otras ocasiones ingresaron a mis redes sociales usando este equipo y con la versión 70.0.1 todo iba muy bien, me sentía seguro. Con la nueva actualización la versión 72.0.1 esto no sucede, se puede cerrar sesión pero me manda un mensaje que dice: “Firefox se desconectará de tu cuenta, pero no eliminará los datos de navegación en este dispositivo”.

I don't remember seeing an server-side redirects when this problem was in my face.   I am sure I did testing to prove the change from http to https was happening in the browser and not the server before posting the question.  My first thought was the problem was happening at the server, that is why I yanked the network cable from my computer and shut down wifi for the test. </p><p>p.s.  It just dawned on me, there might have been browser data for <a href=""http://route66mc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.route66mc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.route66mc.com</a> that I did not delete or see.  I only just today figured out that sort of thing is the reason website login information seemed to be missing from my phone.  I thought it was a problem with syncing, but it turned out to be the login data associated with <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> is not used for <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">example.com</a> and visa versa.  I bet that it was something like that causing the browser to switch, as in the browser cache for <a href=""http://route66mc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com</a> was remembering the redirect to https://www.route66mc. and I looked for browser cache only in https://route66mc </p> id:1303177,created:2020-04-06 17:10:07 -0800,updated:2020-04-06 17:10:07 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Hi firefox195, if I try the URL you seem to be referring to in the original screenshot -- </p><p><a href=""http://route66mc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://route66mc.com/</a> </p><p>-- the server immediately sends a  </p><p><code>301 Moved Permanently</code> </p><p>response code with </p><p><code>Location: <a href=""https://route66mc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://route66mc.com/</a></code> </p><p>as the new URL Firefox should load instead. </p><p>So the http =&gt; https redirect is coming from the web server.

The screen hangs up and I have to restart my machine.,"<p>I don't have video problems with anything else. YouTube, Amazon streaming, Vimeo all work fine. But when I go to Netflix and try to view something, the browser hangs and I can't close the browser or do anything else AT ALL on my computer. I have to do a hard shut-off, which I hate. So far, when I turn the machine back on, everything works fine. Except Firefox and Netflix. I'm assuming this has something to do with privacy settings, but I wanted to know if this is a problem others are experiencing and if there is a simple fix. I don't want to touch the Registry!

This is why I'm still running the older version of Firefox as I update my system with the auto updates only as manual updates with Linux can sometimes be problematic and I am not very tech savvy. I've called RBC a couple of times and they said they were working on the problem but they mainly just blamed Firefox saying Firefox is being  very ""slow"" about resolving the issue at their end. Since I run an older version of Firefox and am having the same issue as users with the newest Firefox it seems logical that the problem is with the bank and not the browser.  </p><p>I should mention the problem started for me only 3 or 4 days ago, however the message to clients started appearing on the RBC website at least a week prior. I did not have any problems logging on at that point so I assumed it was an issue limited to users of the newest Firefox version and since I ran version 66, it didn't apply.

It is a twisty trail, but my conclusion after several hours of digging was that SPDY is a fully-deprecated predecessor to HTTP2. All the major browsers, I believe including Firefox, have now dropped support of SPDY in favor of HTTP2. I believe the appearance of ""spdy"" in the Firefox about:config network preferences is legacy from when SPDY was available but HTTP2 was not yet stable/deployed. So all those preferences that used to relate to SPDY now relate to HTTP2, but the legacy terminology (confusingly) remains ... </p> </blockquote> <p>@Beady - Thank you for taking the time to elaborate. </p>"

Launching an executable from the downloads list may modify the privileges of the launched program, which could affect the parts of disk where it is allowed to open files from. For example, Firefox normally runs with reduced privileges when UAC is set normally, so when you launch a PDF into Adobe Reader from the downloads list, Adobe Reader inherits those reduced privileges. If UAC is not set to its default setting or various programs are run as administrator, there may be a mismatch of privileges.

I wonder if this is a Firefox issue, a Windows 10 issue (upgraded recently as well by MS) or even something else. </p><p>Thank you again. </p> id:1286175,created:2020-01-31 12:08:14 -0800,updated:2020-01-31 12:08:14 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Hi irablum1, if you use the disk icon to the right of that download on the downloads list (access using the downloads arrow icon on Firefox's main toolbar), Firefox should open a File Explorer (Windows Explorer) window with the download selected.

However, I suspect this is some kind of glitch in the browser, as when I checked Waterfox Classic (The only version I could see offered when I went to check the site to get the browser) to see if those problems followed to it, I learned it did not. However for some reason, Waterfox does not have access to the same extensions I normally use in Firefox. Is there a reason behind this? I am planning to downgrade to the immediate preceeding version of Firefox I have to see if that fixes the issues there but I somehow doubt it.

My biggest issue was just why that distortion was happening and why it took so long to happen if it was a driver update issue. In any case, aside from playback being a little less sharp on lower resolution videos, which is a small price to pay, this appears to be fixed, and hopefully it will remain that way.

Curiously enough that appears to have worked. I'm not sure <em>why</em>, but it seems to have fixed the playback issues. It now looks effectively identical to how it used to before, if slightly a bit grainier on netflix but I can live with that. If hardware acceleration isn't required, then I can leave it off, I would assume? I dunno if it worked because I told Firefox not to restore the previous session when I restarted this time or not. But if that is the cure for my issue, Then I'm happy about that. Uhm, would this be something I should check again next time a graphics card driver update goes through? This was very random that it should happen a few days after I updated the drivers rather than the day of.

So I assumed the two share the same help area, if nothing else. I was under the impression that the two programs used similar construction, so I was surprised to see a lack of an adblock or noscript listing when I went onto their own add-on section. Wikipedia also mentions that legacy add-ons and the like are allowed on the browser, so I figured adblock Plus should be there if nothing else. </p><p>Which reminds me, what is the difference between Waterfox and Waterfox Classic? Is there one or are they making a reference to something there?  </p><p>Ah well. Does anyone know what's causing the video playback issues when in fullscreen mode for the sites I mentioned having issues with? It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop. Again, Waterfox shows no sign of this issue in any form, so far as I can discern.  </p><p>I have tried to get a picture of the distortions I'm seeing, but when videos are paused, the distortion vanishes, and even trying to do a print screen shot while the video is in motion results in a complete lack of said distortion showing up in the pictures, no matter how hard I try. This just started randomly happening on Monday Night around between 8 and 9 at night. Prior to that it had been working properly.

So I assumed the two share the same help area, if nothing else. I was under the impression that the two programs used similar construction, so I was surprised to see a lack of an adblock or noscript listing when I went onto their own add-on section. Wikipedia also mentions that legacy add-ons and the like are allowed on the browser, so I figured adblock Plus should be there if nothing else. </p><p>Which reminds me, what is the difference between Waterfox and Waterfox Classic? Is there one or are they making a reference to something there?  </p><p>Ah well. Does anyone know what's causing the video playback issues when in fullscreen mode for the sites I mentioned having issues with? It seems like the first third of the top of the screen is suffering from some kind of distortion that looks somewhere between pixelation and screen tearing, while the rest of the video usually plays normally. What's weirder is that this isn't consistent. Sometimes it will occur near the bottom third of the screen, and sometimes it won't happen at all. The only things so far consistent is that a) it happens only in full screen, and b) it only occurs to me when I'm in the browser on those sites. Nothing text based (i.e. <a href=""http://Fanfiction.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Fanfiction.net</a>) has this occur, nor does it occur on my games that are on my system via steam. Even weirder, having a secondary monitor attached causes the playback issue to vanish, as does having a remote repair attempted on it—which I did try to do when this first started— only to return again when the remote connection is shut down or the external monitor is unplugged from the laptop. Again, Waterfox shows no sign of this issue in any form, so far as I can discern.  </p><p>I have tried to get a picture of the distortions I'm seeing, but when videos are paused, the distortion vanishes, and even trying to do a print screen shot while the video is in motion results in a complete lack of said distortion showing up in the pictures, no matter how hard I try. This just started randomly happening on Monday Night around between 8 and 9 at night. Prior to that it had been working properly. Nothing I do seems to work, and while Waterfox doesn't seem to be suffering from the issue, I'm not sure if reverting to Firefox 71 is worth it since if it doesn't work, that's just time wasted.

The problem is this; when I reopen firefox after either  A) having shut down my laptop, or  B) having simply 'quit' firefox,  I must enter my email address and password again, then enter my phone number so that it can send me a text to the link to the firefox app for my phone (which I have installed), then finally I can navigate firefox as normal and my websites and history are remembered. However, it is not really ""as normal"" because I have to SIGN INTO the websites again. Sometimes it remembers the username and password and all I have to do is click through it, but sometimes it doesn't and I have to manually sign into them. Bookmarks aren't ever saved either. I have attached the screenshot of the screen that comes up every time I reopen firefox and this problem happens. I did not have this problem on my older firefox instillation, just when I updated to the newest version. It is so irritating. If anyone can tell me what to do so that this does not happen, and it remembers me, I would appreciate it.

I wonder if the filename is causing problems with the spaces in it - possibly it isn't being sent with quotation marks enclosing it. </p><p>Although the csv file clearly has the Excel icon assigned to it, and Firefox likely should have defaulted to Excel, can you check in Windows Explorer that .csv and .xlsx files are set to open by default in Excel? You can right-click any file of the type and select Open With, and check or select Excel as the default program. </p><p>If that is all normal and doesn't help, with Firefox closed, you might rename the <em>handlers.json</em> file in your Firefox profile to handlers.json.old. Firefox will make a new one. If the old one is corrupt, this will help. You will need to choose your helper applications again. (If you have a mimetypes.rdf file, rename this also. It is the previous store FF used for the same purpose.) </p> id:1281266,created:2020-01-15 08:41:04 -0800,updated:2020-01-15 08:41:04 -0800,creator:mdixon1895,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Thank you, crankygoat, but unfortunately when I click the browse button and select Excel I get this error message. </p> id:1281123,created:2020-01-14 23:03:18 -0800,updated:2020-01-14 23:03:18 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>If there is no ""Show all applications"" or similar button, you will need to choose ""Browse"" and navigate to the MS Office program folder where Excel lives. </p>"

I run these relevant tests immediately upon bringing up a new incidence of Firefox since that is when the huge accumulations have been sabotaging the operability of everything else on my computer.  The point is that until the garbled v72.0.1, I could always rely on Firefox to zero out the entire cache.  I should not now be compelled, after years of proper operation of the program, to go through three wrist painful clicks to get the thing to finally get around to clearing its accumulated GARBAGE.  Your reference to a ""doomed"" folder has no equivalent on my Windows 7 computer.  It isn't that I'm short on disk space, it is that v72.0.1 of Firefox is accumulating SO MUCH GARBAGE and refusing to clear it that the cache is interfering with even bringing up other programs.  Your assertion that a full GIGABYTE of GARBAGE or large MEGABYTES of such ""are not going to interfere with the operation of other programs"" is contradicted by my real world experience which has repeatedly shown that Firefox's recently inflicted refusal to clear cache is in fact sabotaging my entire computer, even requiring a warm reboot to get anything else to run.  Incidentally I have tried several of the self styled ""clear cache"" addons or extensions and absolutely none of them comes anywhere close to clearing the garbage collection.  Only the five painful clicks using my long since crippled wrists to get to and via the Options/Privacy and Security area has been able to get rid of the garbage which Firefox insists on accumulating and RECENTLY BEGAN REFUSING TO CLEAR. </p> id:1282134,created:2020-01-17 15:59:27 -0800,updated:2020-01-17 15:59:27 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Ha, i usually use about:blank myself.

How are you determining the size of the cache remained after clearing?  You don't have to wait for cache to clear at shutdown, you can clear it any time. Make sure you have no other web pages open other than your Preferences page, or a blank page when clearing cache, as an open page cannot be cleared.  </p><p>There are multiple ways to access the Clear History.

Checking folders under /Cache2 gives me an empty /entries folder and about 2.2MB in /doomed folder. </p><p>If your excessive cache storage is in the /doomed folder, yes this could be a problem. This is supposed to be for open/active pages, including the Firefox Home or any home page. These are set to be deleted, but <em>when</em> is not specified - apparently not very soon at all in some cases. (This is even listed as a bug, as it should be.) This, however, has been the behavior for years, so i do not know if it addresses your issue. You can manually delete these if Firefox is closed, if it helps. </p><p>If you type about:cache in the address bar and Enter, in the Disk section you can see the location of your cache2 folder, and also list any cache entries. </p><p>A last thought: Unless you are radically short on disk space, application temporary caches are not going to interfere with the operation of other programs.  This doesn't excuse Firefox if it is misbehaving, but it does point to an issue that a change to Firefox will not fix. </p> id:1281249,created:2020-01-15 07:50:42 -0800,updated:2020-01-15 07:50:42 -0800,creator:bobgru,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>@crankygoat Your suggestion to check the Task Manager/Processes was a good one so I brought up the Task Manager (always set to Processes anyway since that's the only relevant aspect) then brought up Firefox.  There were four processes shown as ""firefox.exe"" in the list while Firefox was running.  They all disappeared instantly when I exited Firefox so our (yes I was wondering about that too) suspicion about belated exit wasn't borne out.  As for the notion of ""already been fetched from the web"", unless Firefox has been redefined in such a way as to go out on its own (my home page is ""about:blank"") to gather trash from the wubb, the notion of having ""already"" gathered garbage doesn't hold.  The baseline 26.0 Kb appears to be only Firefox's *own* use of cache.  It's the MEGABYTES of *carryover* garbage, reaching a full GIGABYTE at one time early in this inquiry process, that are my concern.  It's quite clear that the cache is *not* being overwritten and that the sabotaging of bringing up any other program after Firefox *leaves* it excessively large is THE PROBLEM.  I looked into my installation records and unfortunately didn't record the v72.0.1 ""upgrade"".  Last one I did record was v71.0 in the week ending 191206.  So my bottom line remains that a DEFECT WAS INTRODUCED during the ""upgrade"" to v72.0.1 which defeats the years and years of proper operation clearing cache upon exit. </p> id:1281102,created:2020-01-14 20:30:46 -0800,updated:2020-01-14 20:30:46 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Controlling P-i-P: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox</a> </p> <blockquote> When I exit Firefox and twiddle my thumbs for awhile, then fire it up again to check Options\Privacy &amp; Security, I'm still finding as much as MEGABYTES of garbage that haven't been cleared from my cache. </blockquote> <p>You might check in Task Manager, Processes tab, to ensure all the Firefox processes have terminated.

The only problem that has been cleared away is the obnoxious, never authorized by me to be installed at all on my computer, ""picture in a picture"" function which was inflicting its disruptions on every video that I attempted to stream until I accidentally ran across it and shut it off during my scramblings to try to resolve this apparent new defect in the way that Firefox operates.

Removed those as part of checking out your suggestions.

Firefox has been acting strange lately. Opened up the package contents of the app (on macbook pro 2012) and saw a chrome manifest folder that seemed to be blocking web access on certain sites. Using a similar computer (with ff installed) and decided to look in the app folder. I saw a blocklist.xml sheet. Wondering if this is something that should be in there by default? Some of the things on the list, are things that i'd more likely need than not need. Here is a list of blocked sites and ip addresses. Any help is greatly appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks,  </p><p> &lt;blocklist xmlns=""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/2006/addons-blocklist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/2006/addons-blocklist</a>"" lastupdate=""1578526685310""&gt;

Using FredMcD's second link I was able to go into Firefox's about:config and set ""security.ssl.enable_ocsp_stapling"" to false and it would work, but it made me feel less secure.  </em> </p><p>The actual fix, to fix the letsencrypt nginx reverse proxy was as follows.  Go into your Unraid rootshare (a youtuber named spaceinvaderone has a two minute video on how to do this).  Go to appdata -&gt; letsencrypt -&gt; nginx and open ssl.conf with a text editor. </p><p>Go down to this part in the text:  </p><p><em># OCSP Stapling </em> ssl_stapling on; ssl_stapling_verify on; resolver 1.1.1.1 valid=30s; # Docker DNS Server ' The line starting with ""resolver"" was set to something like ""127.10.0.1"" which doesn't actually resolve anything.  I set it to ""1.1.1.1"" which is Cloudfares DNS, and then Firefox started loading the site just fine!  </p><p><em>I still have no idea why it would work randomly, but it's fixed now.

Ah-HA!, he said. THEN.. you can EXPORT all or some (selected) bookmarks to  an HTML file. zowie! 'folderized' bookmarks are labeled with the foldername preceding; the HTML is a linear sequential report (haven't tried SORT or SELECT options to see if they modify the export). </p><p>But you might want to check out <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/faview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">www.nirsoft.net/utils/faview.html</a>. here's the skinny from the website: </p><p><em> FavoritesView displays the list of all your Favorties (of Internet Explorer browser) and bookmarks (of Netscape/Mozilla browsers) in a single page. Each line in the list specifies the title of the item, the URL address, the created/modified date of the bookmark item, and the folder name. You select one or more of these bookmarks, and then copy them to the clipboard, delete them (Only for Internet Explorer Favorites), export them to tab-delimited text file, HTML file, or XML file. FavoritesView also allows you to locate duplicate URL addresses in your Favorites/Bookmarks or find specific item by specifying the URL or the title. </em> </p><p>...which is a bit more useful than vanilla HTML, IMNSHO. </p><p>BTW, there's BUKU utilities on NIRSOFT, it's a treasure trove; some of them can really get you out of WTF?! jams.

I now find that Sunbelt Kerio Firewall is available again (free), so I'm thinking of reverting back to it if I can't get any satisfaction with Windows Firewall.  I've been using Firefox and Thunderbird since the end of the old Seamonkey days.  Actually, it's weird, but I'm finding at the moment, that upon booting my PC, I can sometimes open Firefox and Thunderbird, but after closing them and using Photoshop or Autocad or some other software for a few hours, and then try to open Firefox or Thunderbird, it won't allow, and that's when I am now getting the problem as mentioned in my original post. </p> id:1280243,created:2020-01-11 19:07:55 -0800,updated:2020-01-11 19:07:55 -0800,creator:crankygoat,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Do you have an extremely limited user account on Windows?

If I switch to satellite view, the roads are there, but not when switching back to Map view.  All the minor roadlines disappear.

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall. </p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen. </p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout. </p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly. </p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second. </p><p>Reproduce: - client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a> - client.html: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/BzxDP3EZ</a> </p><p>1) Put client.js and client.html into a directory and open client.html in Firefox 72. 2) (optional) Do the same but with Chromium. </p>",other;firefox-720;desktop;linux;,firefox,other,en-US,"",anole3623,""

This continues indefinitely. </p><p>When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next. </p><p>It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour. </p><p><br> Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors. </p><p>In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute ‘postMessage’ on ‘DOMWindow’: The target origin provided (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’) does not match the recipient window’s origin (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’).' error. </p><p><br> I believe this could be a recent issue because I was able to make several payments last month with all settings the same. I have a separate user.js file that I keep my settings in (I can send it over if required).

When OneTouch is activated, the text 'Securely logging you in...' appears overlayed with the spinning wheel in the popup window. This continues indefinitely.  When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next.  It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour.   Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors.  In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute ‘postMessage’ on ‘DOMWindow’: The target origin provided (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’) does not match the recipient window’s origin (‘<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>’).' error.   I believe this could be a recent issue because I was able to make several payments last month with all settings the same. I have a separate user.js file that I keep my settings in (I can send it over if required). These settings have not been changed since the file has been created.   The following actions have been tried and didn't improve the situation:  - refreshing the current profile  - disabling all addins  - adding <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> into exclusions for 'Block pop-up windows' and Enhanced Tracking Protection  - cleaning History and cookies   I then launched Firefox with a separate 'clean' profile and was able to make the payment successfully. Sure enough, importing my user.js file broke PayPal. I went through the settings commenting them out by groups.  The following setting was causing the issue:  user_pref(""privacy.firstparty.isolate"", true);  Setting it to 'false' made the PayPal popup window work correctly again.

If you have more than one profile listed there, one of them will say <strong>This is the profile in use...</strong> so that's the profile that you are using. In the <strong>Root Directory</strong> row of that table, there will be a path name along with a <strong>Open Folder</strong> button.

Are you saying: 1. Leave the import url statement but delete the @namespace url statement from userChrome.css.  2. Copy the code from the tabs-on-bottom.css file and paste it below the import url statement in userChrome.css.  3. Leave the tabs-on-bottom.css file as it is. </p><p>That results in a userChrome.css file without an @namespace url statement and apparent duplication of the tabs-on-bottom code.

KeePassXC allows you to store TOTP secrets for online services inside a database and generates the corresponding timed one-time passwords for you.

1276793,2020-01-08 12:51:39 -0800,2020-01-09T14:47:00Z,Firefox is a corrupt organization. Here is why,"<p>While back, firefox users got outraged due to bookmakrs comment section was removed. Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks. Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc. </p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section. </p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites. Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks. This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find. It may also be a government imposed function. Either one. </p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ? </p><p>WTF ? I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ? What the hell are you talking about ? YOu care about my privacy ?

Then they removed that setting, citing the upcoming deprecation of Flash as justification ... even though that isn't going to happen until the beginning of 2021. Because every website that uses Flash is on their own internal timetable to replace it with whatever is appropriate in HTML5, this means every time I access a site that hasn't upgraded yet, I have to authorize Firefox to run Flash via the pull-down from the address bar.  EVERY SINGLE TIME. </p><p>It happens that there are four sites I visit daily, in order to play Hidato, Sudoku, Jumble, and the like.  I have been visiting those sites for literally years.  They pose no security threat, yet they are probably going to be staying in Flash until almost the last minute, because those online puzzles are going to be difficult to replicate in HTML5.  I have asked -- multiple times -- for a relatively simple fix, which is to modify the pull-down to allow Firefox to ""remember"" my decision to allow <strong>only for that site</strong>. </p><p>All I get in return is ""we did this because Flash is going away"" ... well, yes, I have acknowledged that every time.  But they acted more than a year before that was going to be an issue, they have inconvenienced every user who has a circumstance like mine, and now we are at FF72 and guess what still hasn't been addressed by them. </p><p>I'm going to keep complaining about this until either they put in a temporary fix (which, of course, would be removed along with Flash support itself a year from now) or time runs out.  I figure that if they can't be responsive, they deserve to be called out on it as often as they put out a release that doesn't address this simple, basic problem <strong>which they created and now apparently refuse to fix</strong>. </p><p>Corrupt?

If it's too far off this topic, I can repost it as a separate question. </p><p>For some time, my Firefox profile has had a userChrome.css file containing tabs on the bottom code, which worked.  I don't know what other code was in the file.  However, after a while, as Firefox updated before version 71, Firefox's tabs began to crash unpredictably and with increasing frequency when connected to the web.  Nearly every time, after a few tab crashes, other programs open on my Windows 10 computer would freeze and/or I would get a black screen or both.  Restarting Firefox and/or the computer did not help for long.  Creating a new profile and copying the bookmarks and other existing personalized data files to the new profile also did not help. </p><p>After I installed version 71, I made the needed changes in userChrome.css to keep tabs on the bottom working, and the crashes stopped.  When 72 arrived, tabs on the bottom stopped.  I was unable to get them working again until after 72.01 installed and I installed tabs on the bottom code only.  However, the freeze, etc. problems have started again.

They can (and do, apparently) dynamically black-hole some IP addresses, or perhaps DNS lookups.  Looks as though stale information in that list managed to collide with Firefox's local detectportal Akamai service.  Telstra's on-line chat and telephone support operators were completely ineffectual in diagnosing this, by the way.  Both gave up.  The second advised strongly <em>against</em> rebooting the router.  Sigh.  I'm fairly sure that if the modem still had its default LAN configuration settings, the mymodem.modem URL would have resolved to it, but it doesn't, and my highest priority DNS is google's IPv6 one, I think, so that doesn't resolve to anything. </p><p>Router restart did ""fix"" the problem though. </p><p>It would be nice if the network.captive-portal-service.enabled frob could be exposed as a settings knob.  This desktop machine isn't going to move to a captive portal at any time, so doesn't need to do the check that triggered the fault.  Wouldn't want to share that with synch services though. </p><p>Thanks for listening! </p>"

I added this question to my watch list because I was looking for some more information for you. </p><p>The <strong>Colors</strong> options in the Firefox settings are global settings, meaning that they will apply to every website. If you are looking to only adjust the background colour for the <code>about:blank</code> page, you will likely have more luck adding a <code>userContent.css</code> file to Firefox. </p><p>The <code>userContent.css</code> file allows you to customize the content that Firefox displays to you, so it can be used to customize the <code>about:blank</code> background colour. </p><p>You will need to use the following code: </p> <pre>@-moz-document url-prefix(about:blank) {     * {         background: black !important;     } }</pre> <p>If you don't already have a <code>userContent.css</code> file in Firefox (which you likely don't), you need to make one. This is done by first creating a <code>chrome</code> folder in your <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox profile folder</a> (if it doesn't already exist). In there is where you create your <code>userChrome.css</code> file, which can be done with a text editor like Windows Notepad. </p><p>Alternatively, I've <a href=""https://send.firefox.com/download/6474a8983f7fb1b6/#Z4yU2BCU4-u90uMOG0fxJQ"" rel=""nofollow"">uploaded a copy of the userContent.css file that you can download</a> and paste into the <code>chrome</code> folder. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The download link is only valid for 7 days. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> id:1279765,created:2020-01-09 18:22:08 -0800,updated:2020-01-09 18:22:08 -0800,creator:acartriana,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>No one would respond, so I finally deleted my FF browser and reinstall it.  </p><p>Pro: My concern over the loss of toolbar sites &amp; bookmarks was wasted energy.

Or are you enabling Sync per device when you feel like it? </p><p>I ask because a desktop / laptop device that hasn't been connected to Sync or <em>used</em>  for quite awhile would have the old, deleted bookmarks and when first connected back to the Sync server it is possible that the initial Sync event went askew.  </p><p>The Sync server sure as hell wouldn't keep 4-6 month old bookmarks around, so the answer is a device that hasn't been used or hasn't been connected to the Sync server in quite awhile. </p><p>Duplicated bookmarks is indicative of corrupted bookmarks.  The ""fix"" for that is to <strong>Disconnect</strong> Sync on a laptop / desktop device and then open Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information and scroll down to <strong>Places Database</strong> and use the <strong><em>Integrity &gt;</em>  Verify Integrity</strong> button and wait for the results chart to appear.  <em>Then view the results.</em> </p> <hr> <p>As far as the ""base cause"" goes, I blame it on ""mobile devices"" Sync - namely Firefox for Android and/or Firefox for iOS, along with a Sync user who may have also used the iCloud Sync extension. I have researched the support threads here and I feel the start of weird Sync issues which seemed to have began 4 1/2 years ago when the Sync feature was modified during the latter Beta stage of development with the Firefox for iOS app - like in May or June 2015. Only users who have connected a ""mobile device"" seem to have the ""duplication of bookmarks"" fault; in a few cases it was dozens or even over 100 sets of duplicates for users who were slow to catch on that there was a problem.  I am hoping that this ""mobile device"" issue will be solved shortly as Mozilla releases new versions of the Firefox mobile web browser app. </p> <hr> <p>In conclusion, if you try to manually repair the 'carnage' by all means <strong>dis-Connect</strong> from Sync on the laptop/desktop devices before deleting any of the duplicate sets of bookmarks.

Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash.  If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in.  Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart.  Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem. </p><p>I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time.  This happened three times in the last six months.  As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on. </p><p>Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop: </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:19:56 achpee kernel: [3642722.464002] Web Content[17741]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f6881995024 sp 00007ffd2548d010 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f687d5ad000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:20:40 achpee kernel: [3642765.713880] Web Content[18209]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f2f71605024 sp 00007fff08ecc490 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f2f6d21d000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 18:20:53 achpee kernel: [3642778.682450] Web Content[18253]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f46d16fd024 sp 00007ffdf062b6e0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f46cd315000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 21:18:29 achpee kernel: [3653435.096133] Web Content[27212]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f081696d024 sp 00007ffd774ee3e0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7f0812585000+4665000] </p><p>/var/log/syslog.1:Jan  5 21:19:52 achpee kernel: [3653518.422883] Web Content[28191]: segfault at 3 ip 00007faa3c23d024 sp  00007ffe1e89e1c0 error 6 in <a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>[7faa37e55000+4665000] </p><p>No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation.

Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting). </p><p>By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime.  Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached. </p><p>I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms.  Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray?  No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday.
