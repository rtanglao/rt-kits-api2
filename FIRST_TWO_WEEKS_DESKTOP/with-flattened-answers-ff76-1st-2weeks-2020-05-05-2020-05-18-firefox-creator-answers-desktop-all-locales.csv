When the Firefox Account for Sync is reset all the data is wiped from the account. The data which is sent to the Sync server is encrypted via the Password being used at that time, a new Password wouldn't decrypt that data so the data is worthless and is wiped. Plus, that feature allows the user to remove corrupt data from their Sync account; it is a sorely needed maintenance feature that was lacking years ago. Personally I ended up with 5 different Sync accounts over time because I was suffering from corruption, and needed to start with a new, fresh Sync account in those days to continue using Sync. <em>BTW, I was a volunteer ""tester"" of Weave, which later became Sync when it became a standard feature in Firefox, when it was available as an add-on for users to follow and to contribute to the Alpha and Beta stages of development. But I gotta level with you, I ain't happy with the end product and don't use it other than to observe how it works  between 2 Firefox Profiles on the same PC. And that is what Sync does is to synchronize user data from the Profile, whether it is on one device or multiple different devices. I just don't have the need for owning multiple devices as a retiree on a limited income and no longer have outside employment as I did before the Great Recession which killed the income for part-time jobs. Early version of the ""gig economy"", IMO.

Here is the early version of my question on stackoverflow: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61860916/close-a-window-created-with-window-open-with-window-close-in-an-asynchrono?noredirect=1#comment109430161_61860916"" rel=""nofollow"">early question</a>  </p><p>Kindly someone could point me if this could be a bug or a setting problem or other, and  anyway how to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1313631;1313697;1313698;1313699;1313725;1313742;1313774;1313779;1313791;,umbertciaco,"id:1313791,created:2020-05-18 14:32:13 -0800,updated:2020-05-18 14:32:13 -0800,creator:umbertciaco,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1313779"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> I think window.close() works cross-site, even if access to the DOM of the popup is blocked.

Take a look here: ""<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">MDN cross-origin policy</a>"" in the section ""Window"".   It says that some methods, and between them there is ""window.close"" work in a cross-origin way .  And I'm struggling to understand because in my case doesn't work. However I am grateful to you for your time. I have very appreciated ,and at least I think I identified the problem. </p> id:1313779,created:2020-05-18 14:13:48 -0800,updated:2020-05-18 14:13:48 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I think window.close() works cross-site, even if access to the DOM of the popup is blocked.

Translated it mean that as long as the parent page and the child page have the same origin (domain+protocol+port) I can use the mywindow reference otherwise I can't. So far I tried different sites: <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>, <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/it/firefox/new/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/it/firefox/new/</a> and so on and all those have a different origin from mine.   I tried with two my local page and it works. May be Chrome is more permissive than Firefox.     I very appreciated your advices, I was wondering if I can abuse of your skills and if you could suggest me how to approach the case when the 2 pages have two different origins (i.e. like my case, one local page, and another instead <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>):   if it's possible in Firefox, if it's a configuration problem.... Furthermore i don't understand why other people with my same browser Firefox version are able to run successfully the same code with cross-origin-policy limitation with whom  I'am in troubles </p> id:1313742,created:2020-05-18 13:31:20 -0800,updated:2020-05-18 13:31:20 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>What if you use the two gray buttons near the bottom of this test page: </p><p><a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/popit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/popit.html</a> </p><p>Very basic, same site (same page): </p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick=""launchPop()""&gt;Open a window/tab&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button onclick=""closePop()""&gt;Close that window/tab&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br> &lt;script&gt;<br> var winScripted;<br> function launchPop(){<br>   winScripted = window.open('popit.html#usedButton', '_blank');<br> }<br> function closePop(){<br>   try {<br>     winScripted.close();<br>   } catch(err) {<br>     alert('That did not work.

If you haven't already, could you try:  <strong>New Profile Test</strong>  This takes about 3 minutes, plus the time to test your script(s).

As regards to the jsfiddle I have to clarify: when I run the code with the jsfiddle the google page open in the firefox browser but the starting page,i.e. the parent page, is embedded in the jsfiddle browser and for this rason it works. The problem happens when I execute the code directly in the Firefox browser, I mean both the starting/parent page and the child/google page. </p><p>I slavishly followed your profile-method but there is always the same problem.  But I detected a new little problem: only the first time, when I have to grant the popup permission  I observed by means the ""console"" in web developer tools that ""mywindow"" is null and I get a TypeError when I do mywindow.closed. And later I always get that mywindow.closed is already true (but the google page is still open, and though if I try to close with mywindow.close() it remains opens).    </p><p>If you have any other ideas I would be happy to try it </p> id:1313699,created:2020-05-18 12:27:19 -0800,updated:2020-05-18 12:27:19 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I only have the issue mentioned in the StackOverflow thread: the first time, Firefox blocks jsFiddle from opening a popup and I have to grant permission.

Cause I thought I wouldn't need it, I'd done my backup already before wiping the disc. I just didn't get the bookmarks, cause these past 3 or so years, I do it with sync.

I understand that the profile works that way (which is tbh, at least, idiotic) and that probably all my data is gone (because Firefox has a really bad take into sync+backup, unlike Chrome) but I'm trying to see if there's any other way I could access my said data, stored in a Firefox server perhaps or somewhere. I really need my bookmarks and passwords, and Firefox should have a backup somewhere stored. </p><p>EDIT: Also, the ""warning"" that it gave me was, at the very least, not sufficient enough. I was in a hurry to set up my apps and data etc in my fresh windows install and didn't really give a second look to the text that it popped. I know that this part is my fault, but on a bigger picture, the way the firefox profile works is just wrong. </p><p>So, for safety, if I reset my password on firefox profile, everything wipes? Ok. But I, to reset my said password, have access to the e-mail I used to make the firefox profile? Ok. And somehow, having access to the e-mail I used to make the firefox profile and to reset the firefox password, is not enough evidence that I'm the owner of the firefox profile and the associated email? WHAT? Come on, that's just plain elementary.  If I'd lost my email control, the last thing on my mind would be my firefox profile.  I would worry about bank documents etc not a firefox profile. On the other hand, if I'd lost my firefox password (or just forgot it), the first thing on my mind would be to reset it to get my account back (with all it's data, not a wiped account).  Firefox account should be linked to the email, not a password. </p><p>I am at fault for not reading the ""warning"" clearly, but Firefox is so much more wrong in the way they approach the profile safety. </p> id:1313640,created:2020-05-18 10:05:24 -0800,updated:2020-05-18 10:05:24 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>If you have reset or otherwise changed the password of the Sync account then this has removed all data on the Sync server.

The fact that firefox.exe points to <a href=""http://Softonic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Softonic.com</a> in my Resource Monitor is the reason I posted here. I'll uninstall the Firefox I have &amp; re-download a new version from <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, again. </p><p>Thanks again. </p> id:1313570,created:2020-05-18 07:16:17 -0800,updated:2020-05-18 08:44:28 -0800,creator:wut136912,updated_by:wut136912,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello SP3-Win, I do completely understand that you are worried about downloading Firefox from other sources, as that is normal. What I do know is that Softonic is able to be trusted but however I recommend you to just uninstall the Softonic Firefox and install FIrefox from here, <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a>, as that is the Official and latest version of FIrefox you can install. But 1 thing is, the one that possibly gotten installed by Softonic is not a virus, but there could be something into it.  Thank you for asking that great question and I would love to know how it goes and, Stay Safe!! PS. If I helped, I would really love if you'd vouch(confirm) me on Mozillians.

Instructions say ""Library Window"" but that is not enough hint.","<p>My eyesight is limited.  Unfortunately, I am unable to determine where in the toolbar of the library window the button for exporting bookmarks to an html file can be found.  The attached image provides an idea of what I am looking at. </p><p>IMAGE: <a href=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2020-05-18-05-49-03-6c245b.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2020-05-18-05-49-03-6c245b.png</a> </p><p>The reason I am looking in the toolbar of the library window is the Firefox documentation for version 76 on a mac corresponds to the Firefox version I have and the computer I am running it on states: </p><p>From the toolbar on the Library window, click BUTTON ICON (PLEASE REFER TO ATTACHED SKETCH) Import and Backup and choose Export Bookmarks to HTML... </p><p>I looked across the toolbar, then the entire Window marked ""Library"".  I wrote a program to search the Library window for an image that could conceivably be the button indicated in the documentation.  Sadly, the results of these efforts is I am here requesting assistance.  It is not that I do not love each and every one of you, but my preference is not to have to take the time for putting together a question to post here.  It does not take long, but  when we live at internet speed, every microsecond counts, I know you agree with this very important principle, particularly in light of the visit currently taking place where Covid and his entourage have all of us ridiculously locked up.  We have flattened the curve and also found out the numbers Fauci and Birx showed the President to justify this lockdown have been proven, not correct, more like wildly wrong.  So while we wait for the lockdown to be cancelled, my preference due to how my parents raised me is to be able to find the button described in the documentaiton, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, button not there... unless maybe you can see it  and I am missing it..  My hopes is you will refer to the image at this link in order to enhance the likelihood of success in my quest of the moment, i.e., making my quesiton understandable to anyone who might be interested or/and able to persist in pointing out the location of the great button of the bookmark export. </p><p><a href=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2020-05-18-05-49-03-6c245b.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2020-05-18-05-49-03-6c245b.png</a> </p><p><br> Any assistance you can provide would be much appreciated. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",bookmarks;desktop;firefox-760;mac-os;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1313566;1313648;1313766;1313785;1313786;1313799;1313800;1313810;1313811;1313812;1313815;1313817;1313818;1313820;1313822;1313826;1315417;1315434;1315537;1315696;,firefox195,"id:1315696,created:2020-05-24 23:44:06 -0800,updated:2020-05-25 09:45:41 -0800,creator:manixx0011,updated_by:,is_spam:true,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Although very rarely we need to export bookmarks from our browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox), but if we want to move from one browser to another, then we need it.

Then double-click into the updates subfolder.  </p><p>There are a couple of log files here about what happened with the last attempted update. However, I don't know that we could learn a lot from those. You could view them in Notepad or another text editor and see whether they sound helpful. </p><p>If you find one or more numbered folders, I suggest deleting those folders. Either they are empty, or Firefox is not able to use their contents. </p><p>You probably need to exit Firefox and start it back up again before it checks that folder for changes. </p><p>Any improvement? </p>"

I realized that my saved pws form quiet a big security risk. Anyways I thought it was working pretty well for the first week, I had to type in the oligarchpw every time  I open firefox.

It asks for oligarchpw, and I can just close the window and continue browsing and also access all my websites which are still logged in (like my gmail for example). Is this normal behavior? However it does seem like the oligarchpw is not completely useless; I also tried viewing all my  saved passwords in the privacy/security settings, it will again ask for oligarchpw, but closing the popup window in this scenario luckily does not work.  </p><p>2 other things I noticed concerning oligarchpws: - The popup window has a big delay opening  when you open the browser(about 5-10sec) - Masterpassword would not sync with my firefox android.

You tell it to start a new bisection, say release 64 was good and release 65 was bad, then it downloads intermediate builds, you test, and tell it whether that one is good or bad.

1287092,2020-05-15 12:06:21 -0800,2020-05-16T15:54:42Z,"unable to fully clear cache, stop automatic updates, privacy settings do not work, popups are not being blocked","<p>After my Firefox took a 'ninja update' I was not able to keep the cache clear and even though it was set to clear my cache on exit when i would open a fresh instance of firefox it would have items in the cache. nothing I would do would correct this even completely removing Firefox, the profiles, and reinstalling it. Reinstalling it is turning out to be my biggest mistake. Instead of the version 63 installing, which is what my installer was for the installer is only installing the most recent buggy version My version 63 had updates turned off, it should not have taken an update but it did even though the updates were turned off FOR security. I even had the registry set to block from HKLM When I am 'browsing' the internet I am logged into my machine with a user account that can't even make any changes. The current version (76.0.1) is having the same problems that plagued me before after this 'ninja update', the cache will not fully clear. When I open firefox it is showing it has items cached. There should be NOTHING in the cache when it opens, I do not have a home page set, there are no links set to open at startup and no connections should be made. The popup blocker is not only not blocking any popups it is opening them in new windows The machine does not have a virus or malware. Why is firefox so insecure now? The whole idea of using firefox was to be using a secure browser and just a browser it is not supposed to be integrated into the operating system it is not supposed to be interacting with the operating system it is supposed to be an internet browser. Without the ability to prevent this automatic communication and block unwanted traffic from it we may as well be using Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome.  How do we install one of the older more secure versions of Firefox without it automatically updating at the time of the install? How do we actually block the automatic communication?

The reason is that sometimes how Firefox stores your data (bookmarks, etc) changes during an update.

So Firefox makes you a new blank profile when you try to downgrade. </p><p>That said, you can still try to force Firefox to allow you to downgrade to a previous version and it often doesn't cause any issue. </p><p>Of course though, you will want to <a href=""/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">back up your Firefox profile(s)</a> <u><strong>BEFORE</strong></u> attempting to downgrade Firefox, so that you have a copy of the data in the event that downgrading Firefox doesn't work. </p><p>To force Firefox to allow you to downgrade, you need to use the <code>-allow-downgrade</code> <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options"" rel=""nofollow"">command line option</a> when you start Firefox. You may also need to use the <code>-ProfileManager</code> option as well to allow you to select the old profile. </p><p>An alternative (and potentially easier) option would be to upgrade back to Firefox you had before and then using Firefox Sync to move your bookmarks and other data to the downgraded version 75.

I ran Ookla Speedtests using two different endpoints (Enid OK &amp; Sprint, KC &amp; Wilson Comms) on Firefox, M$Edge, Chrome, and ViaSat's own browser.  The last three browsers ranged intermittently between 30.9 and 54.41 Mbps, while Firefox consistently limped along at 3.61 to 4.09 Mbps.  Tried in Firefox safe mode as well, with no differences whatsoever.  This is easily replicated, here.  Firefox download with Ookla consistently tests at 10% the rate of other browsers. </p><p>I also attempted the same tests on the same browsers using AT&amp;T instead of ViaSat.  Firefox has consistently lower download speeds.  I intend to find a speed test other than Ookla Speedtest, as this could be *their* issue with Firefox. </p><p>Being a long-time Mozilla/Firefox user &amp; advocate, this performance failure is what it finally took to make me try M$Edge. </p><p>Edit:  A test using Speakeasy with ViaSat and AT&amp;T on all four browsers indicated that this is likely an issue with Ookla Speedtest.  Speakeasy's indicated download rate for Firefox was still noticeably slower than the other 3 browsers but it wasn't any where as slow as Ookla indicates.  And, you could see that the download rate was still increasing at the end of the test period, so it's not too much to assume that given a longer test interval, Firefox would have posted similar rates. </p><p>Conclusion?  If you're seeing slow network speeds using Firefox and Speedtest, grab a different test website and browser.  I'd say that Mozilla ought to contact Ookla and ask them what their issue is.  It isn't a user issue. </p>"

Hopefully this is not what happened. </p><p>(2) Windows or MacOS system login </p><p>If you don't use a Master Password, Firefox 76+ requires your OS login to show or copy the plain text of saved passwords. More on this new feature here: <a href=""/en-US/kb/lockwise-password-authentication-prompt"" rel=""nofollow"">Lockwise asks for authentication (password, voice, face or fingerprint) when accessing passwords</a>. </p><p>(3) Firefox Account login </p><p>When you connect to your Firefox Account, Firefox will sync data among your installations of Firefox. If you forget your password and reset your Firefox Account login, the data stored in your account will be deleted. This could lead to a mismatch of data on your Firefox installations that are connected and those which are disconnected, so you might be able to rescue data by NOT connecting those other installations which were previously sync'd. </p><p>- - - - </p><p>It sounds as though you might have reset #3. It's odd that there are entries in the file that are inaccessible to Lockwise. I don't know how to explain that, but <strong>please immediately make a backup of two files</strong>: </p><p>Open your current Firefox settings (AKA Firefox profile) folder using either </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?"" Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> (menu bar) Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> type or paste <strong>about:support</strong> in the address bar and press Enter </li></ul> <p>In the first table on the page, on the <strong>Profile Folder</strong> row, click the ""Open Folder"" button. This should launch a new window listing various files and folders in File Explorer. </p> <ul><li> right-click &gt; Copy the <strong>logins.json</strong> file and paste it in a safe location such as your Desktop </li><li> right-click &gt; Copy the <strong>key4.db</strong> file and paste it in the same location </li></ul> <p>If you drag and drop that logins.json file onto a Firefox tab, Firefox should, after a few moments, show a structured view of the file contents. Does it seem to have 150+ saved logins? Of course, the password will be gibberish; it was encrypted, probably using the key in key4.db. Or possibly a previous key4.db file. Hopefully someone more familiar with these files can suggest a possible recovery method. </p>"

I tried restoring from the 12 suggested files and a couple more and got nothing...I then found 3 HTML files on my desktop and one of them showed a bit of promise. It DID put something back in my bookmarks folder but it didnt look like bookmarks. It was a repetitive list of bookmark toolbar, tabs, recent tabs, bookmarks, other bookmarks and a couple more non specific bookmark related folders... However, I managed to dig further and found that my whole bookmarks toolbar items were in fact in tact and I was able to cut and paste them back onto my toolbar...I had to search over 90 duplicate bookmark toolbar folders to get the right one...I am extremely pleased that Ive got my bookmarks back in place, but really, I am worse off than when I started, as now i fear I have MORE duplicates...so...back to the drawing board.

I'll provide a list at the end of this reply. </p><p>My understanding of your problem is that Firefox 76 broke your hack to work around the default feature of diverting new windows to a new tab instead. The popup no longer is fully featured. Since you want this particular button/link to launch a fully functional popup, you have several possible alternatives to the hack that involve varying levels of difficulty. However, I think they all start with changing your window.open() code so it doesn't trigger a restricted popup and then: </p><p>(A) Turn off the preference to divert new windows to a new tab instead </p><p>This is not site-specific. If you need to see both at once and the original window was maximized, you'll need to restore/resize the new popup since it also will be maximized. </p><p>(B) Keep the default behavior and after the new tab opens, ""detach"" the new tab to its own window </p><p>You can detach a tab by dragging the tab down from the tab bar over the main toolbar and releasing the mouse. If you need to see both at once and the original window was maximized, you'll need to restore/resize the new popup since it also will be maximized. </p><p>(C) Use an extension to create the desired popup </p><p>Does the popup have its own URL, i.e., it's not created using document.write()? An extension could detect the opening of the proofing page based on a parameter in the URL (tabs.onUpdated). If it is already in its own window, the extension could resize it as desired. If it's one of many tabs, the extension could create a new window of the desired size (windows.create) and move the page from the current window to that one (tabs.move). </p><p>This could be a nice bonus product for your users, and the code probably would be 99% the same between Firefox and Chrome so everyone can benefit. </p><p>(D) Redesign your tool to use a framed page for interactive preview instead of a separate window </p><p>If your users haven't been clamoring for this and your competitors don't yet offer it, it may not be worth the effort at this point. </p><p><em><strong>Feature Suggestions</strong></em> </p><p><em>Discussion Sites/Advocacy</em> </p> <ul><li> Mozilla Discourse: <a href=""https://discourse.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discourse.mozilla.org/</a> <ul><li> If none of the categories seem to fit, try <a href=""https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/firefox-development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/firefox-development</a> </li></ul> </li><li> Reddit (monitored by Mozilla): <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/</a> </li><li> I saw someone created a Change<em>.</em>org petition but I don't know who sees those </li></ul> <p><em>Limited Length Comments</em> </p> <ul><li> Feedback site: <a href=""https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/</a> </li><li> Twitter (Mozilla official): <a href=""https://twitter.com/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/firefox</a> </li></ul> <p><em>Bug Tracking System</em> </p> <ul><li> Unfortunately, new feature requests tend to get a low priority: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/</a> </li><li> See: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Bugzilla Etiquette</a> </li></ul> id:1313415,created:2020-05-17 11:42:07 -0800,updated:2020-05-17 11:42:07 -0800,creator:mattgrdinic,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It's been a long week so apologies, but with all due this is an <em>insanely</em> bad move.  </p><p>This feature was literally THE reason why I used Firefox over Chrome all these years. I realize popups get a bad wrap but consider: I run a software company that creates web forms. When you preview the form you press a save button and a popup appears with your finished form.

Gone. Worse, this change also removed the ability for popups to have tabs. I used tabs in popups all the time to perform secondary ""research tasks"", such as looking up a function call in Stack Overflow, etc. This was a <em>wonderful</em> way to work, as my ""main"" browser window sat uncluttered as I dutifully worked on my secondary task in the popup. When done a single click closed that ""task"" and my main browser window was ready to go again.  </p><p>What's so aggravating is this was a solved issue for <em>years</em>.

Let's say the site is lfoo.bar.baz (it's a subdomain, and the top-level is not a .com). When I open a new tab and type ""l"", Lfoo does not autofill; it is in the dropdown and I have to press the Down arrow to highlight it.

After this, instead of autofilling LinkedIn, which I barely use and hadn't visited in 90 days (places.frecency.fourthBucketCutoff), the location bar would not fill in anything after I typed ""l."" </li><li> I gave my Lfoo bookmark the keyword ""l.""

This worked, but of course browsing history is now suggested for every other input (which I don't want-- it's why I had this turned off in the first place).

In particular, Firefox may not know you intend to use A4 sized paper until until you pop up the Print dialog and use the Preferences button to select a paper size, by which time you're out of Preview. Until you print to a new paper size, Firefox may re-use the last size rather than knowing your current intentions. </p><p>In addition to the margins you set in the Page Setup dialog, Firefox sometimes becomes aware of ""unprintable"" areas for your printer and automatically prevent you from using those.

The only site I've been on that displays images that download with a webp file name is programmed to add that appended webp.  It's not Firefox that's to blame.  I have not experienced Firebox's browser adding a webp to a file name on any other sites, so it seems to be something unique to a single site I was referring to.  I just wondered originally if Firefox had an easy add-on that would automatically convert the webp files to jpeg, gif or mpeg, for example, so my computer would read them normally.  My computer and software programs I use don't recognize a webp file name. </p> id:1324776,created:2020-06-16 23:07:39 -0800,updated:2020-06-16 23:07:39 -0800,creator:tjphoto40,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1321372"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> Hi tjphoto, if I could mention one other option: browsers can display webP image files, and also capture screenshots.

I was trying to come up with a solution that preferably didn't involve too many steps.

Anyway, these seem to be pretty easy processes to use, based on my experience so far.  I also have the option of using the Grab software that came with my Mac to do a kind of screensave that I can control the cropping on.  This saves as a tiff, then I use Photoshop to convert the tiff to a jpeg or whatever format I choose.  At the moment, I think there's only one website I frequent that has been displaying files with a webp format in the name and only started this recently.  So it's not a common problem with all sites I visit that have images or video clips.  However, I've noticed there are sites like twitter and instagram, I think, that control images to prevent visitors from dragging the images to your desktop or doing a right click to save, etc.  I understand the importance of protecting people's images.  But of course software like Grab can still save these images and convert them easily enough. </p> id:1324732,created:2020-06-16 17:00:03 -0800,updated:2020-06-16 17:00:03 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi Gelio, welcome to this thread.

I used to be able to set the lengths I wanted for my address bar and search box.  My firefox is updated to the latest version but the address bar is way too long and the search bar is too small.  If I go to customize and remove any icons from in between them then once I get out of customization I can get them to stay the length I need.  I can use the cursor to change the lengths with the bar between them. </p><p>However, if I put an icon back it lengthens the address bar substantially and then shortens the search bar.  I never had this problem before and I am including images to show how the bars look when I put the icon in and when I take it out.  I used to be able to put the icon in between as shown in the second picture and have it shorten the length of the address bar.   </p><p>The first picture shows it currently, the second how I can make the bars without icons and the third is how I want it to be but this is in customize.  Once I click 'DONE' the bars revert to how they look in picture one. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.

You can't remove those, but each time you save a bookmark by pressing the star, you will be asked what folder you want to save the bookmark in. </p><p>By default, if you don't pick a folder, your bookmarks is automatically saved to the Other Bookmarks folder, which is basically just unsorted bookmarks. </p><p>Most people will save their bookmarks into the Bookmarks Menu folder. </p><p>My guess is that, if you imported your bookmarks from Internet Explorer into Firefox, all of your Internet Explorer bookmarks are probably in a folder called Imported From Internet Explorer, or something like that. And I'm guessing that if you look in that folder, you will probably see the structure and sorting of bookmarks and folders that you had in Internet Explorer. </p><p>What you can do in that case is use the Library window to move those bookmarks out of that Imported From... folder into the Bookmarks Menu folder. See <a href=""/en-US/kb/sort-bookmarks-quickly-find-ones-you-want"" rel=""nofollow"">Sort your bookmarks to quickly find the ones you want</a>. </p><p>As a side note, Firefox gives you some generic bookmarks when you first install it.

This is a much easier way to access your bookmarks and a lot of users find it much less convoluted than using the Library button (the stack of books button).

I've been the victim of breaches.,"<p>I've had a hacker or whatever you would call someone who gets into my computer regularly. I have Malwarebytes Virus Protection and am going to get MWB Privacy. My debit card has been frozen x 15 days now without their sending me a new one. What this thug does is go to my email account, sign in as me, and tell them he/I forgot the password. Then he can verify it, and then he does the same thing. For about four months, he came and went, and all he did was change all my passwords. No matter what kind of secure p/w I used, he could always change it. On 04/26, I saw a charge on my debit card for $1.00 from FacebookPay or whatever, a verification charge. I immediately called FBPay and told them that was a fraudulent charge. I asked them to close the FBPay account. They did, but they also, without my permission, froze my card. I immediately reported that to the bank but they were busy merging with another bank, and they lie, so I still don't have access to my stimulus check or my last two paychecks. New bank is assuring me it's in the mail.  Naturally, I want to know what to do when I get my new debit card so the thug won't see it. I figure I can either order things I need from Amazon and eBay and then delete the card, or I could call them and give them the card info. I've been told I need to have this computer wiped clean, but that would leave me with no means of communication or getting my money out, since they only let you get $500 a day.. How do I deal with this thug? Thank you. I don't know much about computers. I'm considering taking it back to the store where I bought it and demanding one exactly like it or better but I don't know if that would go over or not. I can't pay rent, buy food, pay any bills, or do anything because the debit card people have all my money. I need to resolve the problem of my thug before I set up a new computer.

So I booted up Firefox, and the ping started going back to the way it was before I rebooted the system, ie. a high ping spike (in the red) every 5 seconds. There's a definite pattern to it as well, as I have saved graphs showing what's going on. </p><p>I'm using Chrome for the time being, but I've been using Firefox for years prior and very minimal hiccups to speak of, until now.

So here's the information that was so cleverly removed by the Support software: </p><p>But I could not find anything about restoring the profile that Firefox had before it upgraded itself. My hunch is that Firefox somehow screwed up and deleted that file. I looked in Library&gt;Application Support&gt;Firefox and found ""profiles.ini"", and it was created in 2017, but modified this morning, and is only 375 bytes long. This suggests that Firefox simply removed the contents of my profile and replaced them with a bare-bones profile. I couldn't even access my original Firefox account--I had to create a new account just to get to this page. </p><p>There is also two folders inside the Firefox folder: the first was created this morning and has 37.7 MB of contents, but the second has contents going back to 2018 and has 379.1 MB of contents. This appears to be associated with the original profile.  </p><p>Here are the contents of ""profiles.ini"": </p><p>[InstallAB29A9FE12074BA9] Default=Profiles/es39c72z.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/es39c72z.default-release </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/s6sqihjd.default-1531544800420 Default=1 </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>[Install2656FF1E876E9973] Default=Profiles/s6sqihjd.default-1531544800420 </p><p>Now, the first default profile (Profiles/es39c72z.default-release) is the bare-bones profile. But the second entry (Profiles/s6sqihjd.default-1531544800420) is the big one, and I suspect that it is the original. So I'm tempted to just edit profiles.ini to use the path for the original profile. But that's always a tricky business; for all I know, running Firefox with a modified profiles.ini could end up with smoke pouring out of my Mac's ears.  </p><p>Any thoughts? </p>"

Google implemented as part of its ""Instant Results"" feature that would build the page as you typed. Google at some point discontinued Instant Results, and this feature seems to have gone extinct with it. (It annoyed a lot of people who wanted to use the down arrow for scrolling the page, so that's why it was a topic on this and other forums.) </p><p>I don't think Google currently intercepts the up and down arrow keys, or the tab key, so if you find an add-on that lets you assign behaviors to these keys on the site, it should work. Possibly the fastest approach would be to find a user script, which generally is a short-ish script injected into the page to add functionality or make modifications.

My PC has all my bookmarks, and I have it empty on android. On my first try after signing in on both devices and turning on sync, I did get a ""mobile bookmarks"" folder (with the few default bookmarks) on PC, but my many PC bookmarks did not appear on firefox for android. For now I've disconnected both, after also unchecking bookmarks from the sync in both etc. But I still want to get my bookmarks onto my phone from my PC, and I've read sync is how you do that. And this attempt did not sync any bookmarks onto android. </p><p>Edit: tried again the next day, signed in on PC first and then on android, with only bookmarks checked under sync options on both devices. This time it did work, and my PC bookmarks are all on android under ""Desktop bookmarks"". So that's cool. </p><p>Since my first try yesterday I had deleted my few default android bookmarks so that that one was empty. And I backed up and restored my PC bookmarks and tried a couple things. So this time around I don't currently have any ""mobile bookmarks"" folder on PC. I've added a couple bookmarks and subfolders on the mobile bookmarks on Android, hasn't popped up on PC yet. </p><p>Also a minor note, for some reason the ""bookmarks menu"" part was minimized after I first tried syncing, so for a bit I thought my bookmarks just weren't showing in the ""all bookmarks"" menu. So that wasn't an issue. </p><p>Anyways, still figuring out a couple things on the android side, folders etc. How they work differently than on PC. On PC you can have folders mixed in with bookmarks, but on android all subfolders appear at the top of a folder, instead of interspersed the way I placed them on PC. So that can mess with organization for me. And stuff like that. But mostly it's sorted out. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-7601;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1311743;1312093;,groovyxo21,"id:1312093,created:2020-05-11 14:31:29 -0800,updated:2020-05-11 14:31:29 -0800,creator:groovyxo21,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>the-edmeister <a href=""#answer-1311743"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> What specific questions do you still have with regards to Sync on Firefox desktop / laptop devices?

Does it match what you actually account password is? </p><p>When you log into a website, your password that you entered goes through a form of encryption to produce what's called a <em>hash</em>. When you sign up for an account on a website, the hash is what's stored on the website's server, not the actual password. That way, if someone breaks into the server, they can't see all of the passwords, only hashes that can't be reverse engineered into passwords. </p><p>When you log in, the website converts your entered password into a hash and then checks to see if it matches. This is all usually done by the website's server. However, some websites have a bad habit of getting Firefox to convert the password before it's submitted. In that case, Firefox will convert the password into a hash when you press the login button and replace the password you have entered with this hash. </p><p>Unfortunately, that means that Firefox only sees the hash and that's what's saved in Firefox Lockwise. Of course, that means that when you get Firefox to fill the password in next time, it fills in that hash that it saved. Then, the website forces Firefox to produce a hash of the hash, which won't match what the website has on it's server. </p><p>To make a long story short, if the password stored in Firefox Lockwise doesn't match what your password should actually be, edit the password in Firefox Lockwise so that it's correct. The next time you log into the website, Firefox may ask to update the password because it's again seeing the hash version of the password, but you can just deny it from updating it. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

I contacted discord about the problem and they suggested three steps to try: </p><p>1. Make sure the computer has no virus by running malwarebytes. 2. Try setting my DNS to google public DNS. 3. Refresh and renew my IP address by opening a command prompt in administrator mode and typing three commands: </p><pre>  a. ipconfig /release   b. ipconfig /flushdns   c. ipconfig /renew </pre> <p>Given that my computer works with Edge, I took the liberty of assuming the first two steps really weren't necessary because 1. If it had a virus it is likely to affect all browsers (notice I said 'likely'). 2. They both should be using the same DNS, so changing that shouldn't affect anyting. So I jumped immediately to step three.  Step three also happens to be the easiest and least intrusive to do, and I could always go back and do steps 1 &amp; 2 and then step 3 again if necessary.  I closed my discord connection (closed Edge) and then typed in those three instructions.  It started working immediately.  The only thing I didn't do was verify that there was still a problem before I typed in those instructions because it had been several days since I'd tried it. </p> id:1312248,created:2020-05-12 09:17:34 -0800,updated:2020-05-12 09:17:34 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello  bryon timon  and  B.R.,<br> </p><p>See this bug report  (last two comments posted only a few hours ago) :<br> </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1367049"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1367049</a><br> </p><p>This is what  Discord  has to say :<br> </p><p><a href=""https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001310031-Voice-Connection-Errors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001310031-Voice-Connection-Errors</a> </p> id:1312239,created:2020-05-12 08:03:01 -0800,updated:2020-05-12 08:03:01 -0800,creator:brubingh,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I also went through the steps to reset firefox by clicking menu, troubleshooting, reset firefox and it is still stuck on RTC Connecting. </p> id:1312231,created:2020-05-12 07:36:38 -0800,updated:2020-05-12 07:36:38 -0800,creator:brubingh,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have the same problem.

I *think* it quit working after I made the settings change.  I used about:support to check what config had been changed and changed the media.autplay.default from 0 back to 1 but it still doesn't work. I cleared the cache and cookies and that didn't help.  I tried installing the update to 76 and it still doesn't work.  I have verified that other people in the chat can both hear and speak to each other.  No one can hear me and I can't hear them.  The mic is enabled in firefox.  I ran the discord mic test and that works.  It just will not connect to the RTC server. </p>"

As a result ive spent countless hours reading up and investigating what needs to be disabled. As such I found tons of things that needed immediate action, for example: </p><p>Media.peerconnection/geo.enabled/tls.version change to 3/resistfingerprinting/disable updates/cache.disk.enable false/disable screenshots/telemetry/media.webspeech disable/webgl.disabled /rue/dom.battery.enabled false/privacy.firstparty.isolate true/media.navigator.enabled = false/browser.safebrowsing.enabled = false/delete all google references/dom.events.clipboard/dom.storage/normandy/healthreport/beacon/extensions.getAddons.cache.enabled/network.http.referer.spoofSource/dom.ipc.plugins.flash.disable-protected-mode/disable POCKET/disable screenshots </p><p><a href=""https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/</a> </p><p>I thought I was safer having done all that stuff, but after reading more and more I'm now convinced that all that is a complete waste of time. </p><p>This is absolutely nothing that can be done to prevent this disgusting spyware POS from invading my privacy. If it isnt FF itself through its settings, hidden settings, hidden extensions its their dozens of partners like GOOGHELL, amazon and bing to name a tiny few. </p><p>Note to windows users - you wanna see loads of disgusting HIDDEN FF spyware on your device? Download cccleaner and go to 'tools' 'browser plugins' 'firefox' and it will show you all the disgusting spyware thats installed! </p><p>After a decade of being a 100% FF user I feel robbed, cheated, conned and tricked by the filthy scum that is MOZILLA. </p><p>THERE IS NO PRIVACY WITH THIS BROWSER - IT IS A DIRTY FILTHY DISGUSTING LIE!!!! </p><p>I cannot wait to get this disgusting, filthy POS off my device forever.

Please refer to my previous questions <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1268819"" rel=""nofollow"">number one</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1273792"" rel=""nofollow"">number two</a>. Do note that my second question has NOT received A SINGLE REPLY from anybody. I have now updated to version 72 and then subsequently to version 76.0.1 (which the latest one at the time of writing this question. I am still suffering from the same problem of stuttering 1080p 60fps YouTube videos due to frame drops, <strong>especially using the VP9 codec</strong>, although other codecs also drop a few frames. Do note that the audio works just fine in real-time without any lag, and this problem exists ONLY for 1080p @ 60 fps, not for any other resolution or frame rate. I have referred to the following links to try and solve my problem:- </p> <ol><li> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8qhbhg/h264_1080p_60fps_stutter_youtube_vimeo_etc/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8qhbhg/h264_1080p_60fps_stutter_youtube_vimeo_etc/</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277519"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277519</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0.2/releasenotes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0.2/releasenotes/</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608485"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608485</a> </li></ol> <p>The Firefox version 72.0.2 release notes categorically state that the issue has been resolved and even points to the bugzilla page for the same. But it still exists even in version 76.0.1, which is surprising. I have tried every possible combination I can think of, from setting <em>media.media-capabilities.enabled</em> = <strong>false</strong> in <strong>about:config</strong> to disabling specific codecs and hardware acceleration, none of which solved the issue permanently to my satisfaction. A few settings, at times, improved the issue slightly but there was no permanent solution, even though this has been alluded to in a previous release note. Do note that my graphics drivers are updated and this issue is Firefox-specific, i.e other browsers work just fine. Even the older versions of Firefox work fine, as stated earlier. I would like to state that I prefer using the VP9 codec because other codecs take a toll on my relatively low-bandwidth network connection and this leads to longer buffering times (VP9 does not have this problem). I humbly request the community members and volunteers to help me in this regard, <strong>and if need be, point me to the proper channel for lodging a bug report directly to Mozilla</strong>.  </p><p>Thanks and regards,<br> Preetodeep Dev. </p><p><em>P.S:-</em> If this issue is not resolved, then I will have<strong> no choice but to go back to Firefox version 62.0.2</strong>, which works just fine with all the default settings. </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;needsinfo;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1326147;1328929;,preetodeepdev,"id:1328929,created:2020-07-01 10:12:32 -0800,updated:2020-07-01 10:12:32 -0800,creator:preetodeepdev,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>ashmedai <a href=""#answer-1326147"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> Hello all So, basically I have this problem too. 1080p 30 or 60fps sometimes with 720p as well.

Generally all works as desired.  However, intermittently (couple times a day ---&gt; once every few days) the browser simply, quietly refuses to allow the CAC to login, when I visit a CAC-secured site.  A browser dialog is presented and asks for my PIN, but closes without error, yet the PIN is not accepted and the site (correctly) refuses access.  In my troubleshooting, I found that if I look at the Security Devices tab under Privacy&amp;Security, the PKCS#11 module shows the CAC as not logged in.  If I attempt to log in at that page, I get the usual PIN dialog, but after submission, a new message box appears with the notice that ""Log in failed"", and I can see that module still says Log out.   </p><p>It appears that some file lock or related mechanism is in effect and needs to be reset.  The only solution I have been able to use is close Firefox completely (all windows), and restart.  This works but not desired as I have several different sites I'm active on, and each requires separate logins. </p><p>Any suggestions for further troubleshooting would be appreciated.  My forays into Google searches all end up as help to get CAC card working, which is not my problem.

For example, a user may want to run the regular Firefox, but they may also want to have a pre-release test version of Firefox installed (like Firefox Nightly). For those users, Firefox automatically creates a new blank profile on your computer. </p><p>The reason this becomes an issue for Mac users running directly from the DMG file is that Apple treats that as a ""disk"". Because of this, a number of different events might cause the location of your Firefox installation to change, tricking Firefox into thinking that this is a new version of Firefox that you have installed. </p><p>To fix this issue, see the <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-download-and-install-firefox-mac"" rel=""nofollow"">How to download and install Firefox on Mac</a> document to properly install the Firefox browser by moving the <code>firefox.app</code> file into the <code>applications</code> folder on your Mac. Then, only open Firefox from that file. That should stop the location of Firefox from changing and should fix the issue that you are having. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

I was poking around a website that I spotted opening additional browser windows behind my current one. These windows were advertising and the browser windows had most of the toolbars removed. My usual reaction to this is to immediately update my Hosts file with all of the URL's involved in the chain of events that opened up this unwanted window. However, after I did this, they still managed to open up despite being listed in my Hosts file to block! Here's what I noticed: </p><p>Blocked URL's listed in my Hosts file remain blocked when attempting to open in my main browser window. But these sneaky windows opened up behind this window had the blue / purple badge displayed. I learned that these ""pop down"" windows were resembling an incognito session as it did not contain my Firefox account info, or much of anything else. I believe that the use of the Privacy Protection feature is what allowed these advertising windows to open up despite being listed on my Hosts file -because the session is so well protected, that even Windows can't see what's going on in there! </p><p>I have to admit, I am actually impressed with the creativity of this trick. But to me this looks like in all simple terms to be an instance of taking a new feature and turning it around and using it against us to ploy their wares. It is advertising now, but I can see this easily progressing into malware if it hasn't already.

Typically, I set the volume levels for applications using pavucontrol, the pulseaudio utility. </p><p>When I'm watching any sort of media stream in Firefox, Youtube for example, I'll adjust the volume of the stream using the ""Firefox: Audio Stream"" slider that shows up in pavucontrol's playback section. This works fine. My problem however,  is that when I scroll back and forth in the video, refresh the page, or move to another video in the playlist, the slider in pavucontrol immediately jumps back up to 100%, ignoring the value I had just previously set. I want to know how to make the change I made in pavucontrol <em>persist</em>. </p><p>This can be mitigated by using the in browser volume controls (the youtube volume slider), but these are usually quite small and don't offer as much control as the pavucontrol sliders do. Something else to note is that if I go into Firefox's about:config and set media.volume_scale to a value greater than 1, the pavucontrol sliders begin to act how I would like them to (not resetting to 100%). However, upon doing this audio streams now start at 0% volume, and the in-browser ""mute"" button is broken (sets the volume to 0, but won't change it back). </p><p>Is there any way to achieve this behavior in Firefox? Literally every other browser I've tried just doesn't mess with my audio settings, so it's quite frustrating. This problem has persisted for years. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;linux;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ryan.goniwiecha,""

I get nervous when I read this paragraph below.  I stay away of storing anything on the cloud, only on my computer do I want passwords stored.  Actually, I have Lockwise disabled for now, only because I have to enter oligarch password everytime I want to view a sites password.   I like the old way where I enter oligarch password once and can view all site passwords and better manage.  Other than that Lockwise looks fine, thought about reverting to it, but this breached password checking raised a red flag.   I know I can turn it off.   </p><p>Starting in Firefox version 76, Firefox will also check to see if you’ve reused  any of these potentially vulnerable passwords with other logins you’ve saved to Lockwise. The browser does this by creating an encrypted list of your breached passwords, then checking it against all saved passwords. Firefox does not keep logs of your plaintext passwords or know them. </p>",firefox-750;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1311007;1311211;1311219;,diverjer,"id:1311219,created:2020-05-07 19:00:03 -0800,updated:2020-05-07 19:00:03 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>It appears that the HIBP service does indeed use SHA-1.

That service monitors lists of breached websites and lists that become publicly shared among hackers and other malicious actors. The HIBP service allows Firefox to search a list of hashed information (emails, passwords, etc). </p><p>When a computer hashes something, it converts the regular text into a unique collection of characters. Every time you hash the same text, it will produce the same collection of characters. This can be used to compare information without actually seeing what the information is. </p><p>For example, when you create an account on a website, that website doesn't store your actual password in their system. Instead, the password is hashed and the hash is what gets saved on the website's server. Then, when you try to log in, the password you enter gets hashed and then that hash is compared to what's stored on the website's server. If the two hashes match, then the password is correct. If not, it means the password is incorrect. </p><p>The Firefox Monitor does something similar. It will hash your email address or your password. But for extra security, it doesn't send that entire hash to the HIBP service. Instead it does something called an <em>anonymized range query</em>. That means that Firefox sends only the first 6 characters of the hash to the HIBP service and the service gives Firefox a list of all the hashes that start with the same 6 characters. Firefox then takes that list and compares your hash to see if it matches one on the list. </p><p>The technique is described in more detail in the <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/06/25/scanning-breached-accounts-k-anonymity/"" rel=""nofollow"">Scanning for breached accounts with k-Anonymity</a> post on the Mozilla Blog from June 2018 when the Firefox Monitor service was introduced. </p><p>The <a href=""/en-US/kb/firefox-monitor-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox Monitor - Frequently asked questions</a> document also has some additional information about the Firefox Monitor service. </p><p>Getting the notification that your password or email address has been breached or matches a piece of information in a breach poses little security risk because you should change your password if you get this notification anyway. Since the breaches on the HIBP service are already known breaches, that information has already fallen into the wrong hands, so it's not safe to use anymore. </p><p>Hopefully I've answered your question and clarified the service for you. </p>"

This is an issue because the location of the Firefox program can change when you are running using the DMG file, which tricks Firefox into thinking that it's a new installation. </p><p>For a new installation, Firefox is designed to create a new blank profile for you, making it appear as though the browser has been reset and all information has been erased. </p><p>Fortunately, as it sounds like you've already discovered, recovering the old information is not typically a difficult process. It involves going to the <code>about:profiles</code> page in Firefox and then setting the default profile back to the original profile so that Firefox opens that profile whenever it opens. </p><p>However, continuing to run from the DMG file will cause the same issue to occur. Running Firefox from the <code>firefox.app</code> file after it's copied into the <code>applications</code> folder should stop the issue from happening. </p><p>As a side note, when you copy the application into the folder and launch Firefox from it, a new profile will again be created for you because the Firefox location has changed. You can recover the profile again using the steps described above. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Within these folders there are several sub-folders with the same name, e.g. there are main folders named after the main theme and beyond that (sometimes also 2 or 3 levels beyond) there are folders named after a country.  </p><p>Folder Theme A </p> <ul><li>  Folder Country A </li><li>  Folder Country B </li></ul> <p>Folder Theme B </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item Folder Theme B part 1 </li></ul> <pre>  + Folder Country A   + Folder Country B </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item Folder Theme B part 2 </li></ul> <pre>  + Folder Country A   + Folder Country B </pre> <p>.... </p><p>I have remarked now several times that the bookmarks of the Countries are moved or gathered in different folders. First I thought I moved a folder by accident, but it happened now serveral times and today it was clearly not made by me. Today Firefox now gathered the content of several Folder Country A of different Theme-Folders together in one. But it gathered only the content, the folder itself were moved to complete different Theme Folder where I found 3 sub folders now of Country A (but empty as the content was gathered. </p><p>To make it better understandable: </p><p>Folder Theme A </p> <ul><li>  Folder Country A </li><li>  Folder Country A (from Theme B) - empty </li><li>  Folder Country A (from Theme C) - empty </li><li>  Folder Country A (from Theme D) - empty </li></ul> <p>Folder Theme B </p> <ul><li>  Folder Country A (contained the content of the Folder Country A folder of Theme A, B, C and D) </li></ul> <p>But this is only one example, I had also once found only one further subfolder in a complete different folder. I don't see a concrete process how these issue is occurring. </p><p>Obviously there is a mix-up due to the same name of the folders, there ar eno bookmarks missing. But to rename the folders is not really a solution for me, especially as these folders are not duplicate in the same level of folders. I am not sure but I am assuming that these mix-ups has something to do with the sync function I activated in Firefox now a while ago. There are currently 3 devices which are synchronised over my Firefox account (1 Win10 laptop, 1 Android mobile and 1 Android mobile). But I have nothing changed with my mobile e.g., I just add sometimes bookmarks over the mobile devices. The ""wrong"" placements are also visible in the bookmark manager in Firefox on my mobile devices, so it is not only an issue with some settings as the bookmarks were really changed also over sync.  </p><p>What can I do or is this a bug with the sync function? </p>",bookmarks;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;firefoxsync;feature-request;synccomplexfolderhierarchy;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1310817;,jochen.jacoby,"id:1310817,created:2020-05-06 07:01:34 -0800,updated:2020-05-06 07:01:34 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>IMO, that is a Bug with Sync when the Firefox desktop / laptop version is 'mixed' with Firefox for Android or Firefox for iOS.  Been going on for almost 5 years now <em>iirc</em>, based upon 'spot' reports early on and with increasing frequency in the years since the Sync service was modified for the arrival of the Firefox for iOS version, and new version <em>(at that time)</em>  of Firefox for Android a few months earlier. <br> Also, too many users have reported similar issues when they were using a ""different sync"" app or extension <em><strong>along with Firefox Sync</strong></em>; the same as we saw 12 years ago <em>(2008 / 2009)</em>   when Foxmarks / Xmarks was being used along with the new <em>(at that time)</em> Firefox Weave / Sync service, which was long before ""mobile devices"" were added to Firefox Sync. <br> It is my opinion that the ""bug"" lies within the Sync server software with the manner that the server handles ""mobile"" bookmarks slightly differently than the ""desktop"" bookmarks. The dozens of hours that I have searched this forum for the first mention of this corruption issue led me to my assumption that the Sync server software is the culprit.  Very unscientific method of fault finding,  but I can't experience it myself, as I don't use any <strong>Firefox for ... </strong> mobile devices. <br> <br> That said, my advice is to <strong>disconnect</strong> all devices / computers from Sync then on desktop / laptop devices open <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshooting Information</strong> and scroll all the way down to <em><strong>Places Database</strong></em>  and used the <strong>Verify Integrity</strong> button and wait until the verification process runs its course and the results appear. <em>It will show you what was 'fixed'.</em> <br> Do that with all desktops / laptops; the ""mobile Firefox"" doesn't have that feature; <em>may not need it, because few users who have reported this issue have had it affect their ""mobile"" bookmarks, iirc.</em> <br> Then before connecting back to Sync on any device, changed the password for your Firefox Account which serves to clear all the saved data on the Sync server and get rid of the corrupt data. Most used device first when connecting to Sync, and make sure that you don't rush the process when connecting subsequent devices. It will take some time for the Sync server to process all the transferred data from scratch. </p><p>Additionally, I don't follow your description of your folder hierarchy; the simpler the better, IMO. Two to three folders deep, any deeper and that may cause issues for some users especially with Sync on multiple types of devices; <em>i.e. ""mobile"" and desktop / laptop</em>.    </p><p>In closing, I have stopped using Sync completely 3 or 4 times over the last 12 years, <em>or so</em>, due to frustrations similar to yours.  I don't have a ""smart phone"" and only have 2 desktop PC's, one of which is rarely used and kept around <em>(operational)</em>  as a ""backup"".  So, I am not a Sync ""expert"" just another user who can see the benefits of Sync; and I am still pissed-off over Mozilla not supporting the first version of Sync <em>(which was known as Weave and used an add-on; before 2010 when Firefox 4.0 got Sync as a built-in feature)</em> which was used with Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 to ""build the Sync"" feature.  <em>That left me ""high and dry"" with a Netbook eeePC that I was using for my job, which wasn't capable of handling Firefox 4.0; and that was after trying 4 different 'flavors' of Linux. The first time that I ran into that not carrying features forward from Mozilla.</em> </p>"

Since Privacy Badger uses its own lists, it may protect against different privacy threats. Whether that is worth the occasional pain of broken pages is difficult to say: if you want to manage the least number of exceptions, then you might just stick with the built-in feature rather than supplementing it. </p><p>On #2, HTTPS Everywhere can save you a bit of time and attention in upgrading your connection for you. Sometimes this leads to a dead end -- a secure connection error -- but I assume that is pretty rare (or everyone would have stopped using it by now).

Using Win10/FF76, with NoScript 11.0.25 (&amp; previous).   NoScript is only extension.    </p><p>Since AmEx redesigned their website several (many?) months ago, I've had increasing issues using Firefox to log-on the site via their (bookmarked) new log-in page (a bookmarked link to their old log-on page still works, as do all my other banking/financial sites, as well as 98% of other sites).   Log-on button reacts when clicked, but no action - doesn't seem to run its script.   Initially, allowing permissions multiple cycles using NoScript (as is typical for some sites, as scripts load) was sufficient (I try to reduce scripts to minimum necessary, always excluding Facebook scripts).   Logging on via link from AmEx home page sometimes worked slightly better.   However, internal site functions seemed to need multiple refreshes on load.   Within the last two months, only completely disabling NoScript for AmEx tab worked.  Today, not even disabling or uninstalling NoScript completely worked.   In addition, today cannot log-out of AmEx site without multiple (~10x) clicks on the log-out button (webpage seems to gradually close down functionality with each click and twirl of the script indicator, similar to functionality loading issue previously noted). </p><p>Clearing all cache and cookies (per FF forum help) works one time - log-on can be accomplished with two attempts, but log-out continues problematic.  Subsequent log-ons problematic. </p><p>As before, problem repeated on other computers (today, two other computers using Win10/FF76; one with a new Win10 and FF install w/o NS). </p><p>Previously, other browsers unaffected (Old MS Edge, Opera).   Today, using MS Chrome Edge, AmEx site worked without problem.  However, noted that AmEx log-on page loaded with Edge was old-style (that still works with FF, also), not new.   All SSL certs (FF and Edge) verified. </p><p>AmEx doesn't have any link to their Web Support - I guess I have to write them a letter..  Suspect it's a problem on their end, not FF, but have run into several sites lately where FF either doesn't run well, or is specifically not supported.   Don't want to give up privacy features and independence of FF, but would like some ammo to hit AmEx with, if it's indeed an engineered problem with their site. </p>",websites;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;amex;webcompat;americanexpress;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",co_gringo,""

I'm running Firefox (version 75.0, auto-updates enabled) on a Windows 10  (Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362) desktop PC. I'm using the built-in Firefox password manager, although as a general practice I do not log into it using my oligarch password unless absolutely needed (for example, to check my email or Slack). For the vast majority of the general browsing I do, I stay logged out of my accounts. </p><p>This has worked just fine for years. However, lately Firefox keeps prompting me to enter my oligarch password, and won't stop prompting me for my password while I'm browsing. Oftentimes I'll randomly receive the prompt, often on sites that should not be asking for a password, such as a blank New Tab or sites that don't have any associated data in my password manager. </p><p>What's frustrating is that, when I close the prompt, Firefox will immediately re-prompt me again to enter my oligarch password, despite me not wanting to log in (or on some sites, not having an account or even a login page). It will keep repeating this prompt incessantly, sometimes for 5-6 times before going away briefly, only to reoccur when I navigate to a new site.  </p><p>My browser is configured to be a bit more privacy-conscious, and I'm wondering if this may be causing this behavior. In Options &gt; Privacy and Security, I've set Custom blocking for the following items: - Cookies (all third-party sites) - Tracking content (in all windows) - Cryptominers - Fingerprinters I have also set my browser to delete cookies and site data upon closure.  </p><p>I am using the following plugins, with auto-updates enabled: uBlock Origin HTTPS Everywhere Privacy Badger Decentraleyes Cookie Autodelete Firefox Mult-Account Containers Facebook Container </p><p>I've searched the support forums for help on this topic and found the two articles below. However, after trying the offered solutions, neither fixed the underlying behavior. Also note that I am not using any third-party antivirus solutions, like ESET Internet Security and Avast, which have been known to cause similar issues with the Firefox password manager. Here are the articles I found: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-oligarch-password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-oligarch-password</a> (I tried these steps and still had the same behavior happen) <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785</a> (this just disables the Password Manager, something I ideally would not have to do to stop this behavior) </p><p>Can anyone provide any insight into why Firefox keeps doing this? I love Firefox but lately it's become a drag to use because of this. Thanks all. </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;oligarchpassword;passwords;lockwise;lockwise76;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1310582;1310583;,andre.tom,"id:1310583,created:2020-05-05 09:04:32 -0800,updated:2020-05-05 09:04:32 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>As a footnote, at startup the Master Password prompt may randomly appear in an unrelated window, but that doesn't happen after I initially dismiss that, so this sounds kind of suspicious: </p> <em><p>andre.tom <a href=""#question-1286080"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> However, lately Firefox keeps prompting me to enter my oligarch password, and won't stop prompting me for my password while I'm browsing.

I wasn't able to replicate this problem in a clean profile, so a setting or some historical data also might be involved, as well as change in Firefox 75. </p><p>You and I are not the only people who've noticed, here are a couple other recent threads: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1285962"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1285962</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1285070"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1285070</a> </li></ul> <p>I realize it's not an appealing workaround, but if you very rarely use the Password Manager (Lockwise) you can disable it by unchecking the box on the Options page: </p> <ul><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it </li></ul> <p>In the search box at the top of the page, type <em>login</em> and Firefox should filter to the ""Logins and Passwords"" section.

You may have to use ""Fill Login"" and ""Fill Password"" in the right-click context menu or even paste username and password from the about:logins page. </p> id:1310592,created:2020-05-05 09:49:15 -0800,updated:2020-05-05 09:49:15 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>You can post your question in the add-ons forum; <a href=""https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/add-ons"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/add-ons</a> </p> id:1310586,created:2020-05-05 09:15:59 -0800,updated:2020-05-05 09:15:59 -0800,creator:sludge7051-x,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>. . . just try form fillers at random ? </p><p>. . .
