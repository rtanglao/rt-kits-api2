Using (CCleaner),"<p>Initially this may seem the simplest problem but Im not sure it is.  Perhaps due to order of closing session windows. I have this problem once every few years, So far I havent managed to set up anythng that works reliably to get me out of the mess. I use FF and have over 1000 tabs. 99% of the time 'restore session from before' after reboot works automatically great.  Obviously with that many tabs things slow down, I then use CCLEANER to clear up and reboot.Today I forgot I had mutliple unimportant firefox windows open in addition to my MOTHERLOAD firefox window. I closed my session in perhaps some haphazzard order. On restarting I only had my unimportant windows open.  I have not restarted after this Im still sitting in the new session. I have yet to find a consistent way to backup my open tabs. In the past I had an addon which wrote my tabs to a file but that addon got dumped after an update to FF. I REALLY REALLY dont want to lose my list of tabs as I wont be able to get this info back But more that this what is the safest way to back this info up on a regular basis in a way that I can get back to it? The current way is not 100% foolproof. :( </p><p>I have no history showing in FF as CCleaner removes all that (session data isnt removed). I assume I might have restore or previous restore files? Really not sure where to look. Im on Windows 10. Im not even sure where to look anymore for the sessonrestore file. Perhaps it doesnt save it when it isnt the last window to be closed??? Im reluctant to close this session now too. (Hope all my terminology is correct. Is it a window has mutiple tabs, you can have more than one window all of which comprise the session.) </p><p>Any help appreciated.

Anybody that has access to your computer can see your passwords.  As very few of us have a different password for each place we login obviously if you have some you have more.  The obvious solution is to have 2 levesl of passwords.  One is those we don't care about, that aren't intrusive in our lives.  The other is those that could damage us if in the hands of bad people.  Maybe there's an extension for this that doesn't allow the extension company access to our passwords like passwords managers would?  I just want something to make some passwords not visible by anyone, including me.

When clicking the icon it bounces once and then disappears from the dock. Honestly, this started happening about August 2018, and in my troubleshooting decided to give the Developer edition a try, and for some reason that one worked so I stuck with it. </p><p>Shortly thereafter (a week or two) whenever I closed down the Mac, Firefox Dev wouldn't re-open. Deleting and reinstalling would work, but I'd have to re-set all my settings, re-activate the theme, etc., and all the browsing history would be lost. So, since then I would rarely shut it down.  </p><p>A few days ago I had to shut the Mac down completely, but this time Firefox Dev wouldn't open after re-installing. Oddly, I tried regular Firefox again as a solution, and it opened this time. I tested it out by shutting the Mac down completely, then restarting, and it retained all of the settings! I was really glad to once again be able to shut down my laptop at the end of the day without the headache of having to reinstall and re-set everything. </p><p>Then this morning, boom - back to the same nonsense, except now it won't open at all. Neither the regular FF or the Developer edition will work. I've done clean uninstalls to see if that was the problem, as in: removed them from the Applications folder, removed them from the Downloads folder, removed the /Firefox folder from user/Library/Application Support/, and emptying the Trash. </p><p>I saw in one Support post to delete the fbplugin file, 'as that had been causing Firefox to crash'. The closest I found to an 'fbplugin' file was a bundle-config.1 file, which contained 'fbplugin' throughout the file code numerous times. I renamed it temporarily, but didn't delete it. That didn't help the non-opening problem either.   </p><p>I also tried installing Firefox v 71, same result as the others. </p><p>Keep in mind after attempting all of these solutions of deleting, reinstalling, changing file names, etc., I did a complete shutdown and restart.  Also, I have not downloaded, updated, or changed anything since last week's phenomenon of regular Firefox beginning to work again.  So I'm completely stumped and would appreciate any help.

In other words, with this feature, if a link is opened from a page in container X, but the link does not have a container associated with it, the tab would open in the default container rather than container X.  To give a concrete example:  My Google searches &amp; news are in a Google container.  When I click a search result, e.g., from a news organization that I don't visit enough to make a container for, I'd prefer it did not open in the Google container, but a different, generic one or No Container. </p><p>I realize there could be some odd side-effects if a site spans multiple domains or hosts if they're not all marked for one container, but as an optional feature I think it wouldn't bother people who don't want to deal with that possibility. </p><p>Another way to do something similar would be to allow users to mark a container as ""exclusive,"" meaning any link not in the sites assigned to that container would automatically go to No Container in the absence of an assignment.  These two options also be implemented and work together. </p><p>Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this or if there's already a way to do this that I just haven't found.

This add on not only put tabs not in use into hibernation, but when you closed a tab it went into a recent tab list. Now Firefox browser does the same, but when the browser is closed the list is deleted, but with Tab Utilities the list remained. If there was tabs you wanted to delete you could click on it with your mouse's right button. If you wanted to pull up a tab you hit the tab with your mouse's left button and the tab would once more be on the tab work bar in the same place it was once before. In this ""recently closed"" list you could edit the amount of tabs you desired in the list and the tabs were in hibernation, as such using very little energy and little interference with speed besides freeing up your work tab bar. The author of the add on eventually quit and the add on became incompatible after Firefox version 44 and is disabled on installing the newer versions.  So many of us are having an older version of Firefox. Some of us would like to get the newer version of Firefox. Currently, the only options we have in locating  a newer add on similar to Tab Utilities is by installing a newer version of Firefox, and losing all we had, and install new add ons hopefully finding what we desire.  So, we (it is not just me, but a large group of people I am in contact with) are searching for some new add on that is similar to Tab Utilities so we can move on to the newer Firefox versions.

Task Manager also only lists the processes, no applications. This process is very hard to kill, Task Manager can't end it, nor elevated rights Command Prompt TASKKILL with /FE, NirSoft NirCmd nor PSTools pskill64.exe nor Process Explorer. I have also tried ending all the other processes first I can think of, including explorer.exe, does not help. I'm testing with two administrator level accounts and I'm mostly working this problem with Firefox now, although Thunderbird shows the same symptoms. </p><p>My system is a clone desktop computer Windows 7 PRO 64bit UK, AMD:n Phenom II CPU, GeForce 1050Ti display adapter. </p><p>As antivirus I have Avira Free Antivirus, and I have some suspicions it may be the root of the problems this time. For couple of weeks ago it updated with a new user interface and installed new components. To test that, I tried to uninstall Avira. Each component needs to be uninstalled separately using Windows Programs and Features: two components uninstalled cleanly, one component left an open minimized window that one couldn't pop open nor close. Antivirus and VPN do not uninstall: after you are asked do you want to uninstall and answer YES, nothing else visible happens. If you try to start another uninstall job, you get a window telling you can't start another as one program is already being uninstalled or changed. And waiting doesn't help. I have a support question about it in Avira forum. </p><p>Also last week, Flash Player installation failed with 89% done, tried twice and with same result. And the newest GeForce Graphics adapter drivers installation failed also. Both of those usually always install succesfully. </p><p>Microsoft System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW does not find problems, nor does Windows disc chechker tool. I also run: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab and Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Avira support recommends the Install and Uninstall troubleshooter to get rid of some old Avira rubbish. Also compared Windows folders rights to default rights listed in some web site: did not find differences with the couple of dozen folders I compared. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) according to Process Explorer is enabled looking at Firefox.exe process properties. I know command lines to change DEP settings and found it in System Performance Properties settings also, but have not touched it. </p><p>I've removed Firefox and Thunderbird parent.lock -files, with Firefoxilla both from profile folder C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME and temporary folder C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox before trying to start Firefox again. And since I can't kill the process otherwise, it also means after rebooting the computer. </p><p>Found an advice opening Firefox with SHIFT-key down, should open a safe-mode of the browser. Well, opened only the process in my case. </p><p>There are no previous session related saves (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js) in the profile folder any more, and the sessionstore-backups folder is empty. </p><p>I removed the Firefox installation, rebooted, and installed the 73.0 version 13.02.2020. It behaves similarly: only the process starts. </p><p>Added -p parameter to the Firefox shortcut, and in Windows SAFE MODE  was able to create a new profile: in normal mode Windows the window for creating/changing profile does not open. Firefox doesn't open application window in Windows safe mode either, also tried to run it as administrator option, and pressing SHIFT key, but neither helped. The newly created profile folder only has one file: times.json. </p><p>When installed Firefox again, it wasn't a clean installation: the Firefox folder was empty of files, but I did install into the same folder. Also did not edit register nor delete the profile folder. Which is what I'm gonna try next. However, Thunderbird does not use Firefox's profile, so why does it stop opening the application window same time with Firefox? I don't think Firefox's profile folder can cause all these installation problems and Thunderbird problem. My bet is more likely Avira. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;avira;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1291380;,pelihemmo

Vertailin myös Windows kansioiden käyttäjäoikeuksia alkuperäisiin (Netistä löytyi sivu jolla niistä on listaus) enkä havainnut erilaisuuksia niissä muutamassa tusinassa jonka tarkistin. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) näkyi olevan Process Explorerin mukaan olevan päällä (Enabled) Firefox-prosessinkin ominaisuuksia katsoessa, en ole siihen itse kajonnut, löysin kyllä sen asetuksen Windowsin järjestelmän suorituskyvyn ominaisuuksista, ja komentokehoiteohjeet, jos nyt siitä kiikastaisi.   </p><p>Firefoxista ja Thunderbirdistä olen poistanut parent.lock -tiedostot, Firefoxilla sekä profiilikansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME sekä väliaikaistalletusten kansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox ennen kuin olen käynnistänyt selainta uudestaan, ja koska prosessia ei saa tapettua, se tarkoittaa siis että aina koneen uudelleenkäynnistymisen jälkeen. </p><p>Löysin neuvon avata Firefox klikkaamalla kuvaketta ja pitämällä SHIFT-näppäintä pohjassa, mutta sillä ei ollut eroa mun tapauksessani: vain prosessi käynnistyy. </p><p>Profiilista olen poistanut edellisen istunnon tiedostot (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js) ja sessionstore-backups kansio on tyhjä. </p><p>Poistin Firefoxin asennuksen, boottasin ja asensin uusimman 73.0 version 13.02.2020. Sama ongelma jatkui senkin kanssa. </p><p>Lisäsin kuvakkeeseen käynnistyspolun perään -P argumentin, ja Windowsin SAFE-modessa sillä sai käynnistymään ikkunan jossa voi luoda uuden profiilin ja valita mitä profiilia käytetään. Jos käynnisti Windowsin normaalisti, niin tuokaan ikkuna ei aukea. Firefox ei kyllä käynnistynyt Windowsin SAFE-modessakaan. Kokeilin myös Run as administrator ja SHIFT-napin kanssa, mutta ei käynnisty. Uuteen profiiliin tuli vain yksi ainoa tiedosto: times.json. </p><p>Kun asensin uuden version Firefoxista, se ei ollut aivan ""clean Install"", eli asensin saman nimiseen kansioon, joka kyllä oli tyhjä tiedostoista, enkä käynyt rekisteriä läpi, enkä poistanut edellistä profiilia. Mikä lieneekin seuraava yritys. Joku neuvoi myös place.sqlite -tiedostoa poistamaan/uudelleennimeämään, jota voin kanssa kokeilla. Tässä on nyt kuitenkin huomionarvoista se, että Firefoxin lisäksi Thunderbird alkoi samalla hetkellä käyttäytymään samalla tavalla. Ja sehän ei ilmeisesti mitenkään Firefoxin profiilia käytä, joten epäilen kyllä Aviraakin enemmän kuin että Firefoxin profiili olisi tähän kaikkeen syypää. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,fi,"",pelihemmo

But when moving it to the other monitor/ opening a new window on the other monitor it would not scale properly, but render according to the scaling factor of the other monitor. So, e.g. when moving from the internal to the external screen it would only render to the top left quarter of the screen, while the application was actually being the right size. At the same time the input mapping was according to the actual window dimensions, and not according to the visual rendering of Firefox. This would also happen the other way round, with Firefox then only rendering the top left part of the web page to the entire screen. </p><p>You can see this well on the attached screenshot, but notice that sway is a tiling window manager, so Firefox should actually be exactly the same size as the terminal next to it. Firefox also renders like this when the scaling factor was changed at run time, so the issue seems to me that Firefox on Wayland checks the scaling factor on startup just once globally and does not realize when it was changed or that it can be different on different monitors. </p>",firefox-740;beta;desktop;fix-problems;linux;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1300595;,freddy.wiehl

I followed the troubleshooting steps posted in this community to ensure that ""Preview in Firefox"" appears as a drop-down (it did not originally) and that it was selected.  (Steps involved getting a cleaned up version of mimeTypes.rdf and handlers.json.)  Still, when I click on a the link I was testing this with, it asks me ""What should Firefox do with this file?"" and if I manually select ""Open with...Other...Firefox,"" it will open in Firefox but still download to my PC.  Am I right that the user experience should always be that it automatically opens a new tab and displays the PDF there while NOT downloading to the user's PC?  That being said, I tested another random PDF and it did what it was supposed to.  I only tested these 2 after I did the fixes so I don't have a high sample size to say if it mostly works or mostly doesn't.  There was no discernible difference between the two files: both of their extensions were ""pdf,"" they both had kind of long filenames, and they both had ~100 pages in their files. </p><p>I would like to get away from downloading files I: 1) don't want to keep and 2) don't trust on my PC but want to read. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-730;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1290661;1290673;1290719;1290780;1290806;,ldpmail

In my home country, this has never bothered me as I had an unlimited data plan and therefore was pleased to get fast loading webpages. </p><p>But now, I moved to a country without unlimited data plans (Ghana, 40GB per month, 120GHC, approx. 20€, approx. 22USD) and I'm thinking about how this feature must be eating up peoples data. Because even if you visited a webpage before and most of data is within your disk cache, Firefox will still issue a network request, resulting in increased network activity and therefore consuming additional data. </p><p>In my opinion this adversely affects people in emerging countries, as internet is already a pricey good and Firefox is using more data than necessary, just to allow webpages to load fractions of seconds faster. </p><p>Why is there no UI option (I know it can be turned off, using config key ""network.http.rcwn.enabled"") for users to turn this feature off more easily in order to save data? Furthermore, this behaviour is not even explained to users, so users might not even know Firefox consumes more data than expected. </p><p>With best regards, Gabriel </p>",firefox-730;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",unterholzer.gabriel
