This is my first ever attempt to get help, and I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. I noticed that Firefox now has a channel-app on Roku. But I only connect to my Roku Ultra streaming device using Ethernet. The Firefox browser which I use is located on my laptop, running Linux-Mint-Mate, distro 19 and it's also connected only by Ethernet to my network: My Roku device and my laptop are connected to the same Ethernet-only home network. The reason I cannot use wifi is that my wifi is too slow - Router is 16/4 and I think I'd need a new, much faster router 32/8, or better. But my laptop is very old and it's unlikely it can transmit wireless signals fast enough for a reliable HD signal anyway . . . I would like to be able to send streaming videos from my laptop, to my Roku Ultra - to my TV. (It is not a smart TV - it's just an old Panasonic Plasma HD TV). I have an NBC Sports Pass Gold - Cycling Pass subscription account which (because of their app's. limitations) cannot play all of the available videos from its Roku channel app, because their ROKU channel app's videos are limited to just the most recent 90-day posted events.  But all of the older videos from the earlier part of the season can always be played from their website, directly from my NBC account,  which is located only on my laptop. -So this means that I can only watch these older videos on my laptop. My Linux operating system is running on an older HP Elitebook laptop with a duel-boot setup with Windows XP.  If it is not possible to send these website-only videos across my network via Ethernet to my Roku Ultra device to my TV, could you tell me exactly what hardware devices etc. I would need to buy to do this successfully using wifi?  My wifi speed to my apartment is very, very fast - it uses Comcast's fiber-optic service.  Please note; I am only be able to follow very simple, step-by-step answers. I am elderly and I'm just a novice with computers etc.  Thank you very much for any help with explanations, and options that I might have to accomplish this.

I have tried a couple of times since then to figure out how to retrieve the OneTab data from the profile archive, but have always failed. I tried again this week, and am still failing.

With this I get the permission popup for the microphone and everything works fine. 74.0 and now 75.0 does not popup the permission query but a box appears stating Firefox wishes to make changes to Windows Firewall. Even if I select allow it does not fix the microphone problem. Imaging hd back to 73.0 fixes the problem but at what cost over time? I do have Windows Firewall set to block incoming and outgoing traffic on Domains and Private networks and Public is set to default. I also have Local Security Policy set to treat any connection as Public and cannot be changed by user. So what has changed from 73.0 to 74.0/75.0 that my firewall settings would now impede Firefox from allowing the microphone to work or even producing the popup permission query? Running Win 7 x64 all updated. I am image obsessed and they are all clean and updated with no programs on them. 73.0 and previous work fine with my firewall settings. Firefox-1.png shows 73.0 working properly with Hangouts Firefox-2.png shows 75.0 wanting to change firewall settings which doesn't help and no microphone query. </p><p>Thanks for any pointers.

I did a clean install of firefox and upon importing my bookmarks backup via html some bookmarks failed to update their icon even though it was showing properly on the tab. Even with an identical address it would still be a globe. I tried everything from refresh, clear history, deleting and changing the name of favicons/places sqlite. Nothing worked. Again, this was a clean install. All other firefox sytem folders were also removed prior to re-installing. Program files, appdata, etc. all deleted prior to installing.  </p><p>After trying some things with no luck I found out that If you import your firefox bookmarks to chrome and re-load the bookmarks in chrome the icon refreshed to the correct one. I did that for all missing icons. I then exported the bookmarks as html, but before I imported them back into firefox i completely removed history and all bookmarks once again, and then restarted firefox. </p><p>Once firefox opened I imported the bookmark html from chrome and sure enough it worked. The bookmark icons were back to normal. To test i reloaded the page and even restarted firefox and they were all still ok. There is def an issue in firefox that prevents bookmark icons from refreshing properly. Hopefully the team will take a look into this and get a patch to firefox.  </p><p>I already fixed the issue but I wanted to post here to report my findings in case this was a bug?

Perhaps it wasn't stored. I apologize in advance for duplicate posting!) </p><p>I use Firefox 75.0 (64-bits) on mac OS X Catalina for browsing. It gives me the following issue. When I start typing a youtube… URL in the address bar, a specific sub-page to the YouTube domain pops up first. It refers to s specific clip on youtube. While I’m typing, in front of it a grey star appears, such a marking a favorite. However, it’s NOT in my favorites.  The auto-suggestions do not come from other opened tabs. This option is turned off.  I don’t use any Firefox subscription account services for storing favorites online. Suggestions from search engines are also toggled off.  I’ve tried all remaining suggestions on the following pages to get rid of this issue: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions</a> 1st method for clearing a single item didn’t work; 3rd method to clear my browsing history didn’t work. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978</a> I have turned off browser.urlbar.autoFill = false. Toggling this option, at least, got rid of unsolicited suggestions from the worldwide web such as <a href=""http://youtubemoneycalculator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtubemoneycalculator.com</a>. It’s a partial success! </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978</a> keyword.enabled is set to false, but toggling this won’t make any difference. browser.fixup.alternate.enabled is set to false, but toggling this won’t make any difference. </p><p><br> The only method that makes a difference is to turn off Addres bar suggestions from Favorites (in about:preferences#privacy). But then I don’t get any suggestions at all… </p><p>This example merely illustrates the issue with youtube… domain names, it happens with any address that I start typing in the address bar. Peculiarly, addresses that ARE stored in my favorites, do not appear first in the suggested domain names. Okay, I’ve done my homework! </p><p>My conclusion/question: Some (former) favorites are stored in a location that I have no access to. I would like to receive suggestions as to where I can find these. Preferably, I do not want to delete every single one of them one by one. </p><p><br> Bottom line: It would be nice if I had some sort of control over my favorites. The suggestions appear to be totally random. If the most recently or most frequently visited favorites would appear first, that would make sense. Or if the main page would appear first (<a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>) and not any other subpages. Does anyone know if this is possible and then, how to achieve this? </p><p>Lastly: I don’t understand why a browser that claims to be so concerned about my privacy allows for so many unwanted options. Also, it is a nuisance if these options are actually reset with every update Firefox installs. I have the impression that this happens. I did notice that now and then additional search engines are added to my one-click-search engines (about:preferences#search) without my prior notification. How does this comply with Firefox’s privacy concerns? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-750;desktop;mac-os;mb6;megabar;megabar75;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1305294;1305296;,jan.past.op

I resent FF for preventing me from connecting while seeming to give me the opportunity to connect. I've tried changing settings in about:config, but nothing works. I end up loading Chrome just to get to the login page for the network, where I then connect, and then immediately kill Chrome and go back to whatever I was trying to do.

So fiddling around with every other website and Firefox print setting is not an option. I have attached a sample print to PDF to show the problem. When I print, half the content is hidden. In contrast, whenever I use Google Chrome, I never have this issue. The default printing settings just work, every single time in Chrome. I don't want to switch to Chrome because I want to support the Mozilla/Firefox mission. But the minor issues in Firefox are frustrating. </p><p>Between the lack of a translation tool that can translate the webpage and the poor default printing setting, I am nearly ready to switch. Firefox developers, if you're reading this, please fix this printing issue. While you're at it, please add an inbuilt webpage translation tool. Nobody want to copy and past webpages to translate them. I really want to stick with Mozilla, but you have to improve these little features within the browser.  </p><p>Actually never mind, cannot attach the pdf to show the issue in this forum.

All other programs are working fine, which might cast doubt on hardware/graphics issues. </p><p>ISSUE: When I make a new tab, whether with Ctrl+T or ""+"" tab button, or even Ctrl+Shift+T for opening a working tab I closed recently, the tab will be useless.  I know this will happen because either (a) the tab doesn't show the firefox new tab page, but a gray screen, (b) the address bar will not respond, (c) one or both of the previous, and a small yellow box pops up for less than a second that says ""a script is causing your page to slow down..""--this bar goes away immediately; I had to take a screenshot to read it.  There is no notification of a crash other than this brief bar.  Sometimes an existing tab will freeze, demonstrating the page until I scroll, whereupon new parts scrolled to of the page are just gray, and even old parts that have been scrolled off-screen come back gray, and the page is effectively an image since it's unresponsive, and even typing a new page into the URL bar doesn't do anything. </p><p>What makes this particularly disruptive is that by seemingly random chance and independent of the site being visited, the tab will be useless.  The tab can't be made to work again, it will be frozen until closed and another tab created.  This happens more than 50% of the time and either has gotten worse or more annoying to me over time.  Usually I will middle click a link ten times and open one of 1-3 tabs that worked.  Recently I closed several tabs but wanted to restore one, so I spammed Ctrl+Shift+T, but half the tabs were broken and irrecoverable (except through History). </p><p>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I reset firefox and updated everything for this post.  I have no addons installed, and the plugins are OpenH264 (1.8.1.1), Shockwave Flash (32.0.0.344), and Widevine Content Decryption Module (4.10.1582.2).  There are no recent crash reports in about:crashes. </p><p>Super looking forward to fixing this, the browser is unusable in its current state.

Why does Sync not preserve the separate windows?  With well over a hundred tabs open, this makes recovering/accessing this information very tedious - as all the tabs have to be opened individually, and then sorted into separate windows again, to be bookmarked in their search subject categories/windows!
