Without the ability to prevent this automatic communication and block unwanted traffic from it we may as well be using Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome.  How do we install one of the older more secure versions of Firefox without it automatically updating at the time of the install? How do we actually block the automatic communication?

Let's say the site is lfoo.bar.baz (it's a subdomain, and the top-level is not a .com). When I open a new tab and type ""l"", Lfoo does not autofill; it is in the dropdown and I have to press the Down arrow to highlight it. This is a big hitch in my workflow, because I expect Ctrl-T L Enter to get me to Lfoo like it did before FF75.  </p><p>This is what I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> I tried config modifications to revert the bar to pre-75 behavior. When they didn't work, I reverted them. </li><li> I removed all other bookmarks with sites that start with L, notably LinkedIn. </li><li> I deleted all instances of LinkedIn (the site that was appearing instead of Lfoo) from my history. After this, instead of autofilling LinkedIn, which I barely use and hadn't visited in 90 days (places.frecency.fourthBucketCutoff), the location bar would not fill in anything after I typed ""l."" </li><li> I gave my Lfoo bookmark the keyword ""l."" This worked, but it's a total hack and I shouldn't have to do it; also, it doesn't autofill lfoo.bar.baz into the location bar, but just moves the cursor down to Lfoo in the dropdown when I type ""l."" </li><li> I ticked ""When using the address bar, suggest"" &gt; ""Browsing history."" This worked, but of course browsing history is now suggested for every other input (which I don't want-- it's why I had this turned off in the first place). I don't want Lfoo suggested on the basis of my history; I want it suggested because it's a bookmark and I asked Firefox to suggest bookmarks. </li></ul> <p>Because lfoo.bar.baz is a subdomain, not a .com, and a redirect to a login page, I suspect it has been discounted for suggestion in spite of it being one of my most-used sites and far and away my most used site that starts with L. </p>",bookmarks;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1312295;,rha.rao

My debit card has been frozen x 15 days now without their sending me a new one. What this thug does is go to my email account, sign in as me, and tell them he/I forgot the password. Then he can verify it, and then he does the same thing. For about four months, he came and went, and all he did was change all my passwords. No matter what kind of secure p/w I used, he could always change it. On 04/26, I saw a charge on my debit card for $1.00 from FacebookPay or whatever, a verification charge. I immediately called FBPay and told them that was a fraudulent charge. I asked them to close the FBPay account. They did, but they also, without my permission, froze my card. I immediately reported that to the bank but they were busy merging with another bank, and they lie, so I still don't have access to my stimulus check or my last two paychecks. New bank is assuring me it's in the mail.  Naturally, I want to know what to do when I get my new debit card so the thug won't see it. I figure I can either order things I need from Amazon and eBay and then delete the card, or I could call them and give them the card info. I've been told I need to have this computer wiped clean, but that would leave me with no means of communication or getting my money out, since they only let you get $500 a day.. How do I deal with this thug? Thank you. I don't know much about computers. I'm considering taking it back to the store where I bought it and demanding one exactly like it or better but I don't know if that would go over or not. I can't pay rent, buy food, pay any bills, or do anything because the debit card people have all my money. I need to resolve the problem of my thug before I set up a new computer.

My PC has all my bookmarks, and I have it empty on android. On my first try after signing in on both devices and turning on sync, I did get a ""mobile bookmarks"" folder (with the few default bookmarks) on PC, but my many PC bookmarks did not appear on firefox for android. For now I've disconnected both, after also unchecking bookmarks from the sync in both etc. But I still want to get my bookmarks onto my phone from my PC, and I've read sync is how you do that. And this attempt did not sync any bookmarks onto android. </p><p>Edit: tried again the next day, signed in on PC first and then on android, with only bookmarks checked under sync options on both devices. This time it did work, and my PC bookmarks are all on android under ""Desktop bookmarks"". So that's cool. </p><p>Since my first try yesterday I had deleted my few default android bookmarks so that that one was empty. And I backed up and restored my PC bookmarks and tried a couple things. So this time around I don't currently have any ""mobile bookmarks"" folder on PC. I've added a couple bookmarks and subfolders on the mobile bookmarks on Android, hasn't popped up on PC yet. </p><p>Also a minor note, for some reason the ""bookmarks menu"" part was minimized after I first tried syncing, so for a bit I thought my bookmarks just weren't showing in the ""all bookmarks"" menu. So that wasn't an issue. </p><p>Anyways, still figuring out a couple things on the android side, folders etc. How they work differently than on PC. On PC you can have folders mixed in with bookmarks, but on android all subfolders appear at the top of a folder, instead of interspersed the way I placed them on PC. So that can mess with organization for me. And stuff like that. But mostly it's sorted out. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-7601;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1311743;1312093;,groovyxo21

Please refer to my previous questions <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1268819"" rel=""nofollow"">number one</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1273792"" rel=""nofollow"">number two</a>. Do note that my second question has NOT received A SINGLE REPLY from anybody. I have now updated to version 72 and then subsequently to version 76.0.1 (which the latest one at the time of writing this question. I am still suffering from the same problem of stuttering 1080p 60fps YouTube videos due to frame drops, <strong>especially using the VP9 codec</strong>, although other codecs also drop a few frames. Do note that the audio works just fine in real-time without any lag, and this problem exists ONLY for 1080p @ 60 fps, not for any other resolution or frame rate. I have referred to the following links to try and solve my problem:- </p> <ol><li> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8qhbhg/h264_1080p_60fps_stutter_youtube_vimeo_etc/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8qhbhg/h264_1080p_60fps_stutter_youtube_vimeo_etc/</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277519"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277519</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0.2/releasenotes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0.2/releasenotes/</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608485"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608485</a> </li></ol> <p>The Firefox version 72.0.2 release notes categorically state that the issue has been resolved and even points to the bugzilla page for the same. But it still exists even in version 76.0.1, which is surprising. I have tried every possible combination I can think of, from setting <em>media.media-capabilities.enabled</em> = <strong>false</strong> in <strong>about:config</strong> to disabling specific codecs and hardware acceleration, none of which solved the issue permanently to my satisfaction. A few settings, at times, improved the issue slightly but there was no permanent solution, even though this has been alluded to in a previous release note. Do note that my graphics drivers are updated and this issue is Firefox-specific, i.e other browsers work just fine. Even the older versions of Firefox work fine, as stated earlier. I would like to state that I prefer using the VP9 codec because other codecs take a toll on my relatively low-bandwidth network connection and this leads to longer buffering times (VP9 does not have this problem). I humbly request the community members and volunteers to help me in this regard, <strong>and if need be, point me to the proper channel for lodging a bug report directly to Mozilla</strong>.  </p><p>Thanks and regards,<br> Preetodeep Dev. </p><p><em>P.S:-</em> If this issue is not resolved, then I will have<strong> no choice but to go back to Firefox version 62.0.2</strong>, which works just fine with all the default settings. </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;needsinfo;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1326147;1328929;,preetodeepdev

Generally all works as desired.  However, intermittently (couple times a day ---&gt; once every few days) the browser simply, quietly refuses to allow the CAC to login, when I visit a CAC-secured site.  A browser dialog is presented and asks for my PIN, but closes without error, yet the PIN is not accepted and the site (correctly) refuses access.  In my troubleshooting, I found that if I look at the Security Devices tab under Privacy&amp;Security, the PKCS#11 module shows the CAC as not logged in.  If I attempt to log in at that page, I get the usual PIN dialog, but after submission, a new message box appears with the notice that ""Log in failed"", and I can see that module still says Log out.   </p><p>It appears that some file lock or related mechanism is in effect and needs to be reset.  The only solution I have been able to use is close Firefox completely (all windows), and restart.  This works but not desired as I have several different sites I'm active on, and each requires separate logins. </p><p>Any suggestions for further troubleshooting would be appreciated.  My forays into Google searches all end up as help to get CAC card working, which is not my problem.  The card works until Firefox (or something related in the middleware) freezes and the only recourse is to restart. </p><p>Cheers, --Jim </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-750;desktop;linux;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1325155;1325410;,jimparker96313

I noticed in both my Firefox web browser 76.0 (64-bit) and Thunderbird mail client 68.8.0 (32-bit) that I can no longer use the mouse to drag the window around or resize the window?!?  All other applications are still working fine such that I can open Internet Explorer as well with other applications and continue to move/resize their respective windows just fine.  In Thunderbird, I did have a couple add-ons which I have now disabled and deleted.  I've disabled any add-ons, changed the themes and then changed them back to Defaults, rebooted the laptop several times.  Upon start-up of either application, it seems to work for a few seconds but then the window locks in place and I can no longer move or resize the window.  With Thunderbird, even if I ""Restart with Add-ons Disabled"" the same problem continues.  With Firefox, opening new windows are locked in place as well.  What's going on?

I was poking around a website that I spotted opening additional browser windows behind my current one. These windows were advertising and the browser windows had most of the toolbars removed. My usual reaction to this is to immediately update my Hosts file with all of the URL's involved in the chain of events that opened up this unwanted window. However, after I did this, they still managed to open up despite being listed in my Hosts file to block! Here's what I noticed: </p><p>Blocked URL's listed in my Hosts file remain blocked when attempting to open in my main browser window. But these sneaky windows opened up behind this window had the blue / purple badge displayed. I learned that these ""pop down"" windows were resembling an incognito session as it did not contain my Firefox account info, or much of anything else. I believe that the use of the Privacy Protection feature is what allowed these advertising windows to open up despite being listed on my Hosts file -because the session is so well protected, that even Windows can't see what's going on in there! </p><p>I have to admit, I am actually impressed with the creativity of this trick. But to me this looks like in all simple terms to be an instance of taking a new feature and turning it around and using it against us to ploy their wares. It is advertising now, but I can see this easily progressing into malware if it hasn't already.

Typically, I set the volume levels for applications using pavucontrol, the pulseaudio utility. </p><p>When I'm watching any sort of media stream in Firefox, Youtube for example, I'll adjust the volume of the stream using the ""Firefox: Audio Stream"" slider that shows up in pavucontrol's playback section. This works fine. My problem however,  is that when I scroll back and forth in the video, refresh the page, or move to another video in the playlist, the slider in pavucontrol immediately jumps back up to 100%, ignoring the value I had just previously set. I want to know how to make the change I made in pavucontrol <em>persist</em>. </p><p>This can be mitigated by using the in browser volume controls (the youtube volume slider), but these are usually quite small and don't offer as much control as the pavucontrol sliders do. Something else to note is that if I go into Firefox's about:config and set media.volume_scale to a value greater than 1, the pavucontrol sliders begin to act how I would like them to (not resetting to 100%). However, upon doing this audio streams now start at 0% volume, and the in-browser ""mute"" button is broken (sets the volume to 0, but won't change it back). </p><p>Is there any way to achieve this behavior in Firefox? Literally every other browser I've tried just doesn't mess with my audio settings, so it's quite frustrating. This problem has persisted for years. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;linux;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ryan.goniwiecha

First I thought I moved a folder by accident, but it happened now serveral times and today it was clearly not made by me.

But to rename the folders is not really a solution for me, especially as these folders are not duplicate in the same level of folders. I am not sure but I am assuming that these mix-ups has something to do with the sync function I activated in Firefox now a while ago.

But I have nothing changed with my mobile e.g., I just add sometimes bookmarks over the mobile devices.

Using Win10/FF76, with NoScript 11.0.25 (&amp; previous).   NoScript is only extension.    </p><p>Since AmEx redesigned their website several (many?) months ago, I've had increasing issues using Firefox to log-on the site via their (bookmarked) new log-in page (a bookmarked link to their old log-on page still works, as do all my other banking/financial sites, as well as 98% of other sites).   Log-on button reacts when clicked, but no action - doesn't seem to run its script.   Initially, allowing permissions multiple cycles using NoScript (as is typical for some sites, as scripts load) was sufficient (I try to reduce scripts to minimum necessary, always excluding Facebook scripts).   Logging on via link from AmEx home page sometimes worked slightly better.   However, internal site functions seemed to need multiple refreshes on load.   Within the last two months, only completely disabling NoScript for AmEx tab worked.  Today, not even disabling or uninstalling NoScript completely worked.   In addition, today cannot log-out of AmEx site without multiple (~10x) clicks on the log-out button (webpage seems to gradually close down functionality with each click and twirl of the script indicator, similar to functionality loading issue previously noted). </p><p>Clearing all cache and cookies (per FF forum help) works one time - log-on can be accomplished with two attempts, but log-out continues problematic.  Subsequent log-ons problematic. </p><p>As before, problem repeated on other computers (today, two other computers using Win10/FF76; one with a new Win10 and FF install w/o NS). </p><p>Previously, other browsers unaffected (Old MS Edge, Opera).   Today, using MS Chrome Edge, AmEx site worked without problem.  However, noted that AmEx log-on page loaded with Edge was old-style (that still works with FF, also), not new.   All SSL certs (FF and Edge) verified. </p><p>AmEx doesn't have any link to their Web Support - I guess I have to write them a letter..  Suspect it's a problem on their end, not FF, but have run into several sites lately where FF either doesn't run well, or is specifically not supported.   Don't want to give up privacy features and independence of FF, but would like some ammo to hit AmEx with, if it's indeed an engineered problem with their site. </p>",websites;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;amex;webcompat;americanexpress;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",co_gringo

This leads me to think there must be some aspects that can be handled by an extension, and some that can not due to internal coding. </p><p>I can't understand why the FireFox development team wouldn't work with the community to provide those Tab Mix Plus enhancements to the internal coding that no longer can be created by an extension. It would seem like the competitive thing to do, so i must believe that there either is a real security reason, or simply the old extension was not as popular as i think it was. </p><p>I'm afraid i must admit that it has been so long that there are probably many alternative replacements to the Tab Mix Plus features that i don't recall, yet i really did prefer a setting to open links in a new tab rather than having to hold down Ctrl at the same time of clicking - i know it seems picayune, but it still is a preference! </p><p>I only mess around with VBA, so please use the ""big print and pictures"" method of explanation :) </p><p>Thank-you for your thought! </p>",firefox-750;customize;desktop;windows-10;tabmixplus;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",brucemc777

I'm running Firefox (version 75.0, auto-updates enabled) on a Windows 10  (Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362) desktop PC. I'm using the built-in Firefox password manager, although as a general practice I do not log into it using my oligarch password unless absolutely needed (for example, to check my email or Slack). For the vast majority of the general browsing I do, I stay logged out of my accounts. </p><p>This has worked just fine for years. However, lately Firefox keeps prompting me to enter my oligarch password, and won't stop prompting me for my password while I'm browsing. Oftentimes I'll randomly receive the prompt, often on sites that should not be asking for a password, such as a blank New Tab or sites that don't have any associated data in my password manager. </p><p>What's frustrating is that, when I close the prompt, Firefox will immediately re-prompt me again to enter my oligarch password, despite me not wanting to log in (or on some sites, not having an account or even a login page). It will keep repeating this prompt incessantly, sometimes for 5-6 times before going away briefly, only to reoccur when I navigate to a new site.  </p><p>My browser is configured to be a bit more privacy-conscious, and I'm wondering if this may be causing this behavior. In Options &gt; Privacy and Security, I've set Custom blocking for the following items: - Cookies (all third-party sites) - Tracking content (in all windows) - Cryptominers - Fingerprinters I have also set my browser to delete cookies and site data upon closure.  </p><p>I am using the following plugins, with auto-updates enabled: uBlock Origin HTTPS Everywhere Privacy Badger Decentraleyes Cookie Autodelete Firefox Mult-Account Containers Facebook Container </p><p>I've searched the support forums for help on this topic and found the two articles below. However, after trying the offered solutions, neither fixed the underlying behavior. Also note that I am not using any third-party antivirus solutions, like ESET Internet Security and Avast, which have been known to cause similar issues with the Firefox password manager. Here are the articles I found: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-oligarch-password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-oligarch-password</a> (I tried these steps and still had the same behavior happen) <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785</a> (this just disables the Password Manager, something I ideally would not have to do to stop this behavior) </p><p>Can anyone provide any insight into why Firefox keeps doing this? I love Firefox but lately it's become a drag to use because of this.
