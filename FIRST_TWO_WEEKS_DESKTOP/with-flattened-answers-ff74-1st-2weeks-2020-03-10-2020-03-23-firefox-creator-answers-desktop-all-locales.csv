I've looked up a few fixes before posting and they didn't work: </p><p>- Tried booting FF on safe mode and it didn't fix the issue - it clearly isn't caused by an add-on (and I've never had this issue in my previous browser with nearly the same add-ons installed). - other people seem to have had the exact same issue multiple times and it's lasted for years, so it's clearly a problem on FF's end. </p><p>Here is the issue described more specifically: Copying things from a tab from FF and into the online version of Word does not work - when I try to, the intended selection:  - disappears a few seconds after I've pasted - or it does not appear at all - or when it does, it erases the entire sentence it was pasted next to it, which you can imagine is absolutely bothersome. </p><p>I've also tried to copy/paste statistics from a site called <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org"" rel=""nofollow"">archiveofourown.org</a> onto another FF tab. - What ended up being copied is only the last character of the entire content I was trying to paste, which I think suggests there's some issue with what's contained in the clipboard. </p><p>I'm mentioning these two websites because I'm guessing that something about them is probably conflicting with the copy/paste feature, however I'm hoping no one will have the gall to tell me it's those websites' faults and that I should just stop using them. </p><p>When pasting (while having hopefully copied the former selected content- and no, it wasn't the case), it always pastes the content which was last copied into the clipboard prior to that very attempt, which shows that the clipboard's content was not refreshed with the last selected copied one. </p><p>I'm surprised to see that FF has had such a glaring issue for years and for many other users, and updates have never given a fix for it. I'd like this issue to be fixed properly, because I'd hate to have to switch back to my previous browser. FF sports so many nice features that other browsers don't have, and it'd be a shame to ruin the experience with a bug so basic as the copy/paste feature being broken. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;word;office365;probablynotafirefoxproblem;copyandpaste;copyandpaste74;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1299677;1299705;1308168;1308249;,yumiifmb,"id:1308249,created:2020-04-24 08:53:54 -0800,updated:2020-04-24 08:53:54 -0800,creator:lorraine.franklincoveysa,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Having the same problem.

Problem was that I reinstalled HelveticaNeue recently but with font files that had no latin-extended characters. And thus, since Messenger and the other sites used font declaration like ""HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif"" or likely, it started displaying the faulty font. </p><p>After removing the HelveticaNeue everything is back to normal, as another sans-serif is used for these sites. </p><p>Thanks, regards! </p> id:1299560,created:2020-03-23 00:21:58 -0800,updated:2020-03-23 00:21:58 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Could be font issue and the font that Firefox uses on those page might be corrupted or otherwise not working properly. </p><p>You can right-click and select ""Inspect Element"" to open the builtin Inspector with this element selected. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_and_edit_HTML"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_and_edit_HTML</a> </li></ul> <p>You can check in the <b>Rules</b> tab in the right panel in the Inspector what font-family is used for selected text.

It's poor practice to set a fixed width when printing, since it limits how the browser is able to adapt your content to fit the page. It should be <code>width: 100%;</code> instead. </p><p>This issue is coupled with the fact that the print rules for the <code>.Main</code> element is not removing the padding from the left and right of the page content. This would be done by adding <code>padding:0;</code> to the rule. </p><p>Essentially, because you have set the content to be 7.5 inches wide with 1 inch on either side, the document is 9.5 inches wide. Setting the printing scale to 100% means that trying to print on paper less than 9.5 inches wide is going to cause content on the right side to overflow off of the page. </p><p>The reason you are seeing a lot of whitespace on the <strong>Fit to page</strong> option is because Firefox is still trying to print the 1 inch padding on either side of the content. So you are printing an extra 1 inch of space on either side, plus whatever margins your printer has set. </p><p>So your CSS rules for the print media query needs to be: </p> <pre>.Main {     width: 100%;     padding: 0; }</pre> <p>Hope this helps. </p>"

I even have old confirmation emails, proving the account was created on a device, and then logged on a new device, wich required a confirmation password. </p><p>My conclusion : A sync Account was created, cookies were saved into it, then they were deleted and the browser  stopped saving new cookies on the account.

This is directed to Firefox as an organization. I DEPEND on Firefox. I have 90 - 100 tabs open in multiple accounts, I bought into ""if it doesn't run in the browser"" - I don't want it. Last week, Firefox stopped loading Gmail. Not Gmail Contacts or Calendar - just Gmail. But Gmail worked in if opened in a private window, After much anguish for days, I learned that Right Clicking on a working web page (in the Private Window) allowed me to delete Cache and Cookies FOR JUST GOOGLE. I did it and signed in and whuddaya know, Gmail works again. OK - a blip in the force. Now Slack doesn't work. Exact same symptoms - just non responsive to <a href=""http://slack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">slack.com</a>. Ah Ha I said. Firefox 74 is NFG. Let's just reinstall 73. Ooooh - the miracle minds at Firefox NO LONGER ALLOW DOWNGRADING - BECAUSE (wait for it) - ""most of these problems are not due to an upgrade"". Really? Most? This is not about being polite. This is about allowing a user to revert to a working version when a problem hits. Firefox is losing market share and if you want to know why. Well - here it is. It's unreliable. BTW: I was able to revert Gmail because I had other tabs signed in. I only have 1 Slack tab. I tried using the Private Window tab - nope. I USE Firefox to (1) make my life easier and (2) be more productive than my cohorts. Fail on 1 of those: not good. Fail on both: hello Chrome or any other browser that just works. P.S. I've been using Firefox for...hmmm I'm 70 and its unlikely there was a whole decimal digit in front of my starting version.

Sorry I don't have an account with ""appropriate permissions""! I'll tell you one thing: if you don't fix it soon, I'll be using a different browser. </p><p>Almost every time I go away from my system for an hour or so, when I come back, Firefox has consumed so much memory that my memory is about 95% full (from initially being 65% or less full). My system is so unresponsive that it sometimes takes up to a minute just to run the Task Manager to kill the offending Firefox process. It's always one process among eleven or so other Firefox processes (I keep quite a few windows and tabs open). Killing that process often mostly solves the memory problem for several hours.  It does, however, create several other problems. First, it nearly always causes one or more tabs to crash. They can usually be restarted by clicking the Restart Tab(s) button on the page that replaces a crashed tab. Sometimes, though, one of the Firefox windows quits responding entirely, or more often, a Twitter page can no longer update. In those cases, I have to restart Firefox. </p><p>What seems odd is that the problem appears to happen more when my system is idle than when I'm using it, and actively browsing. Though I suppose that could just be my imagination. What I do know is that the excess memory consumption occurs even if all the Firefox windows are minimized. Why does a minimized window need to allocate great quantities of memory in a relatively short time? </p><p>This bug wouldn't be a big problem if it didn't happen so often. I've had Firefox memory usage problems in the past, but never anything that occurred with the regularity of the current bug. It's been going on for quite a long time; there's been plenty of time to fix it. </p> id:1307652,created:2020-04-21 18:57:56 -0800,updated:2020-04-21 18:57:56 -0800,creator:simpsonadvisors,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Firefox is taking almost 600K of physical memory. </p> id:1298752,created:2020-03-19 13:39:51 -0800,updated:2020-03-19 13:39:51 -0800,creator:evhenry,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>This is a known bug we are working on resolving. it is being discussed here <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608725"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608725</a> </p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience at the moment. </p>"

Easiest to do the sorting is via the right-click context menu in the left panel in the Library where all the folder are displayed. In the right panel in the Library sorting can be done if you right-click a folder name in this panel, but for the main (root) bookmarks folders like Bookmarks Menu and Bookmarks Toolbar folder the only option is via the left panel. </p><p>Remember that ""Sort By Name"" is only available in the right-click context menu of a folder name and not for an individual bookmark.

Additional windows contain other secondary clusters of pending projects. When trying to rearrange my work (=tabs), dragging a tab with the mouse across 50 other tabs is quite cumbersome and difficult to find the right place to sort it into. I'm looking for an easy way, like in Powerpoints slide-sorter where you can see 50+ slides in a matrix grid layout, or in the Mac OS Finder, where you can see thumbnail pictures and rearrange them. Mouse-dragging is great and much appreciated, but has its limits when dragging the tab ""far"" across the tabs to a new location many tabs away. Solutions would be most appreciated. Thanks.

With Firefox, only the first is registered while it loads the previous page. Then I can do it again but it's only registered once, again, and so on. So a quick 'click-click-click' should take me back three places in the active tab's history. In Firefox, clicks after the first are ignored until it's gone back and loaded that page.

More info on managing the Tracking Protection feature in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop</a> (before Firefox 70: <a href=""/en-US/kb/content-blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">Content blocking</a>). </p><p>(B) Extensions such as Adblock Plus, Blur, Disconnect, Ghostery, NoScript, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin or uMatrix should provide toolbar buttons to manage blocked content in a page. There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Cache and Cookies:</strong> When you have a problem with one particular site, a good ""first thing to try"" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site. </p><p>(1) Clear Firefox's Cache </p><p>See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">How to clear the Firefox cache</a>  </p><p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, click the lock icon at the left end of the address bar. After a moment, a ""Clear Cookies and Site Data"" button should appear at the bottom. Go ahead and click that. </p><p>In the dialog that opens, you will see one or more matches to the current address so you can remove the site's cookies individually without affecting other sites. </p><p>Then try reloading the page. Does that help? </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

Some lovely NL person, I suspect! </p><p>As for the actual issue raised in that thread, I have mixed feelings… (This is my humble perspective as a question-asker.) </p><p>I don't like systems which encourage showing off, arrogance, a mentality of ""I'm the best"", competition, leaderboards, and the associated stress of users worrying about their ranking. Systems involving badges and medals seem geared toward creating this kind of environment. </p><p>On the other hand, I don't have a problem with mere statistics being given, like number of answers/solutions. That is very helpful information. </p><p>Technically, the ""Top 25 Contributor"" status is just a statistic, and it's useful to know if the person you're speaking to is a prolific contributor, because you can generally trust his/her answer to be backed by some degree of expertise and experience. I think it's only right that such people have a status/flag to designate that they are committed to regular contribution on the forum. </p><p>Having said that, I do have three problems with ""Top 25 Contributor"" statuses: </p><p>1. Presentation style If it looks like some kind of 'badge of honor' for showing off then that is a problem. The current ALL CAPS styling seems a bit showy. </p><p>2. Ambiguous meaning When I see the words ""Top 25 Contributor"" I automatically assume this is based on some kind of rating of quality. But I now know that it's just based on the number of contributions, which isn't what ""top"" means to me. </p><p>3. Too many categories My third and final problem is that you have two different categories: ""Top 25"" and a ""Top 10"". (Perhaps others?) These categories carry a false sense of rank, with the implication that one is ""better"" than the other, when in fact any prolific contributor is equally worthy. </p><p>Taking all the above into account, if it were up to me, I would ditch ""Top 25"" and ""Top 10 Contributor"" and create a single status for all prolific/regular contributors. I would use lower-case and make it a friendly colour such as green. </p> id:1298303,created:2020-03-17 10:43:15 -0800,updated:2020-03-17 10:43:15 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>MartyJames <a href=""#answer-1298299"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Indeed!

Peculiarly, addresses that ARE stored in my favorites, do not appear first in the suggested domain names. Okay, I’ve done my homework! </p><p>My conclusion/question: Some (former) favorites are stored in a location that I have no access to.

The suggestions appear to be totally random. If the most recently or most frequently visited favorites would appear first, that would make sense. Or if the main page would appear first (<a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>) and not any other subpages. Does anyone know if this is possible and then, how to achieve this? </p><p>Lastly: I don’t understand why a browser that claims to be so concerned about my privacy allows for so many unwanted options. Also, it is a nuisance if these options are actually reset with every update Firefox installs. I have the impression that this happens. I did notice that now and then additional search engines are added to my one-click-search engines (about:preferences#search) without my prior notification.

Any ideas?","<p>So I have been Firefox Developer Edition on three different devices for the past year and just a few days ago on one of my devices, Firefox would not keep my theme settings, extensions, or accept my oligarch password, so I closed Firefox. But that didn't help and since i needed to reboot my system anyway, I did a reboot and when I logged back on and tried to open Firefox it gave me an XUL Runner error saying that 75.0 is not compatible with min version &gt;=74.0. So I uninstalled FDE and then re-downloaded it, reinstalled 75.0 since I do believe that the update to 75.0 had hung up on this particular device a week before. So then a day later my other two devices started having issues, so I tried to sign into another Firefox account, that didn't work so I did a reinstall and it seemed fine for a minute until I realized all my passwords/logins/history were gone, so I tried to sync again and then it gave me the message to set my oligarch password, so I tried and kept getting the 'Cannot change oligarch password' error.

But first you should open Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information on ALL DEVICES and scroll down to the <strong>Places Database</strong> item and use the <strong>Verify Integrity</strong> button and allow the process to run to completion.

Once again, the developers who believe themselves to be gods do not think users should be allowed to set Firefox to allow Flash on specific sites without asking EVERY SESSION, somehow believing that inconveniencing the users is somehow going to force website admins to move away from Flash before the announced deprecation at the END of the year. </p><p>Now one of my daily-visited sites (the one for Daily Jumble) will not wait for me to enable Flash, and when I do enable it I then have to refresh the page to make it work.  It is obvious that if what I have been asking for all along -- being able to tell Firefox to enable Flash always FOR THIS SITE ONLY -- would alleviate the problem, but since the gods cannot see through the eyes of the users, I am now further inconvenienced by their decision. </p><p>I maintain that they moved too quickly and too drastically to implement this change, and I have no reason to believe posting this will make any difference, but I again want them to know that instead of Firefox being the most user-friendly browser in the world (as it USED to be) it now has enough user-UNfriendliness to be as despised as Internet Explorer was. </p><p>I do not believe it to be an unreasonable request to allow this, because they could simply put that functionality in, then take it out along with all Flash support in the first release of 2021.

When I follow the link to unsubscribe, I'm prompted to log into my account. When I log in, I'm prompted to confirm my account via a verification link sent via email. However, that email to my iCloud account never arrives. I've tried repeatedly to have it resent without success. I've had a case escalated via Apple support up to their engineering department, and they say the email isn't getting filtered by them but in fact never reaches their servers, so there's nothing they can do. So now I'm stuck on this mailing list because I can't access my account. Blocking me from leaving the list seems illegal per the CAN-SPAM act. Even being able to log in here seems short-lived, since it appears that tomorrow (16 March) my Mozilla support account will be merged into that same Firefox account that I can't access.

After two or three appearances, Firefox should add a checkbox at the bottom of the dialog to stop the site from showing more alerts. Check that box and click OK to block further dialogs. </p><p>(2) Authentication dialog (asks for username and password) </p><p>If you cancel this dialog, the page may reload and immediately show it again. Pressing the Esc key numerous times in a row can cancel the reload as well as the dialog. </p><p>(3) Reacting to mouse movement </p><p>Some pages have a script that detects when you are moving the mouse pointer up toward the tab bar and takes action to show another dialog, or moves to full screen view to hide the toolbar area. On these pages, the keyboard shortcut is essential. </p><p>Hopefully this will let you close problem pages without having to ""kill"" Firefox in the Windows Task Manager.

1282027,2020-03-14 16:21:18 -0800,2020-05-08T21:49:20Z,A Firefox update disabled/killed the Firefox on my Desktop... Twice.,"<p>I'm fed up with the lack of support from Firefox. This issue has been going on for three weeks. The last Firefox update crashed TWICE! When I opened a Google/Firefox, An Update window popped up. Since I normally let them download or whatever they do, I wasn't concerned. Then it showed an ""Error"". I didn't see an ""Error Code Number or Name"" as it disappeared quickly. I tried to open Firefox/Google. To my surprise, all I got was a Blank Window. I tried clicking on the ""Home Icon"". Nothing changed. I tried my Bookmarks. No affect. I WAS Signed In. I tried finding the Fictional ""Firefox Support"". I got nowhere. I would've Googled the issue, but I couldn't even use that. Nothing Worked. I finely decided to download a NEW Firefox/Google. Once I did, it worked fine all day.  The next day, I opened the newly Downloaded one. Again I was greeted by the Firefox ""Update"" It started, then showed an Error.  Again, I tried to open Firefox/Google. I got the same blank page as before. I decided to Remove, ALL Firefox/Google. from my Computer. Then I download another New Firefox. I made ONE change. I stopped Firefox from Updating Automatically.  Day three, I opened Firefox, I opened  normally... Almost. Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. If I let it Download, it may Crash again. I lost ALL of my Bookmarks too. I went to the Recommended Firefox Site to retrieve them... It was a LIE! Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. I have NEVER missed an Update  Let me guess what Firefox is going to say. That is IF they reply at all; No one else reported this issue. ( And I have Ocean front property in Arizona). Make sure your operating system is up to date.  (I must be too stupid to keep my system up and maintain this Machine). I should upgrade to the (The Digital Pile of...... that goes by the name) Windows 10, and (The Garbage called) Google Chrome. (Why would I Downgrade to one System that didn't work when it was released, a Browser that was Garbage when it was offered the first time (In 2008), and they WON'T Fix? I'd be better off taking a hammer to my PC. and my own head). </p><pre>Just a quick note. When I first signed up for Google (Prior to the 2008 Google Chrome fiasco.) my Gmail stopped working. I could receive Mail, but I couldn't Open, Read, Delete, or anything else. This lasted for Five Years. I tried getting Help. I never got a reply from anyone. Then it started working. No explanation from Google.  </pre> <p>Don't bother telling me ""Well... It is Free"".  It isn't. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;unclearquestion;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1297668;1297672;1297686;1297697;1297783;1297846;1302715;1302858;1302925;1304070;1304090;1304129;1304138;1304549;1304589;1304603;1304607;1304713;1311231;1311243;1311284;1311303;1311357;1311366;1311381;1311386;1311397;1311425;1311463;,kingofnicepeople,"id:1311463,created:2020-05-08 21:49:20 -0800,updated:2020-05-08 21:49:20 -0800,creator:kingofnicepeople,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I don't understand a word of what you wrote.

Rather than having a separate profile with separate bookmarks, it's all in the same profile. And of course the Facebook Container would also prevent you from accidentally logging into the wrong profile. </p><p>The only other notable thing that I can think of is that the Facebook Container also isolates certain Facebook development features on other websites (like embedded like buttons or embedded comments or a ""login with Facebook"" button). But that doesn't really make a huge difference, since you aren't logged into your Facebook account on the profile that you use for your regular browsing. </p>"

It was not the first time I encountered this problem, as it had been happening at irregular intervals, and found that it was caused by firefox replacing the ""cookies.sqlite"" file in my profile folder with a new one, while also dubbing the old one ""cookies.sqlite.bak"". I always resolved the problem by: </p><p>-Closing Firefox </p><p>-Deleting the recently created ""cookies.sqlite"" in my profile folder </p><p>-Renaming ""cookies.sqlite.bak"" into ""cookies.sqlite"" </p><p>-(Usually) Creating a copy of the .bak file and keeping it in a folder as insurance, in case I found no recent .bak the next time it happened or it got corrupted somehow </p><p>After doing this, upon starting firefox I would find all my cookies in place and myself logged in all sites I cared about (I set it up so that firefox restores a long-running, multi-windowed session at startup). </p><p>On a side note, I was always able to know whether my ""cookies.sqlite"" file had been rewritten by checking its size: if it had been just created, it would always be 512 Kb; the backup .bak file is instead 1.50 Mb. </p><p><br> Onto the problem at hand: after updating to 74.0 and finding that I lost all cookies and logins, I repeated the process highlighted above, as usual.  It didn't resolve the problem though: I still didn't recover any cookie even though I switched the ""good"" .bak file with the newly created ""cookies.sqlite"". Upon starting firefox, instead of loading my 1.50 Mb .sqlite it keeps immediately renaming it .bak and creating its own cookies.sqlite.  I even tried using a slightly older .bak, one that I had successfully switched before: the result was the same. </p><p>I am at my wits' end: I checked and tried various cookie and privacy settings, but since firefox updated it seems determined to shun my old cookie backup in favor of creating its own empty, useless file. There also doesn't seem to be any recent documentation on this problem I can find. I even considered opening and checking both .sqlite and .bak files for any obvious differences, but I'm afraid I just don't know how. </p><p><br> Those cookies are critical for my navigation.

I'm having an issue with your software and trying to get to your support bulletin board and all it does is take me round and round through the same set of menus giving me a bunch of pre-written articles.   Stop with this shit.  I want to ask a question, not read your stupid articles that don't apply.   This is your lazy attempt to avoid having to answer people.

I am using Firefox 74.   If I bookmark a page it used to add it to my Bookmarks drop down.  Sometime ago it stopped working.   Now it only shows Bookmarks under ""Recent Bookmarks"" and they drop off the menu after I think 10 bookmarks.     </p><p>I can still find them when I show ""all bookmarks"" under the ""show all bookmarks"" option in the Bookmark drop down menu, but otherwise if I don't immediately drag them from ""Recent bookmarks"" to an existing Bookmark folder, then they drop off the menu entirely and can only be found when showing all bookmarks. </p><p>Is this a holdover from when you guys eliminated showing the file drop down menus by default? </p><p>Why isn't this working properly.

That helps: Firefox can find and contact the server! </p><p>So one possible explanation for this problem is that the server doesn't support the same secure connection parameters as Firefox. For example, it may only support certain encryption ciphers that are not included in Firefox but are included in Chrome. This tends to happen when server admins modify the list of permitted protocols and ciphers with the goal of removing insecure ones, but don't make sure that at least one cipher is supported by Firefox. I don't know how you can diagnose that with an internal server. (With a public server, a test page like <a href=""https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/</a> can query the server and list out the supported ciphers and test connectivity of different browsers.) </p> id:1297037,created:2020-03-12 10:49:51 -0800,updated:2020-03-12 10:49:51 -0800,creator:roedel,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>jscher, </p><p>I created the url without the S and got the message that I needed to us the S </p><p>Then I created the Mar2020 new profile and tried the url and got the same error message and no Advanced to be able to add and exception. </p><p>CWR </p> id:1297014,created:2020-03-12 09:52:15 -0800,updated:2020-03-12 09:52:15 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes1,content:<p>Will your Firefox let you try non-secured access to the site: </p><p>http://192.168.0.253:10000/ </p><p>If that doesn't immediately upgrade to HTTPS, do you get an error message for that address, too? </p> <hr> <p><em>Could you try:</em> </p><p><strong>New Profile Test</strong> </p><p>This takes about 3 minutes, plus the time to test your problem site(s). </p><p>Inside Firefox, type or paste <strong>about:profiles</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it.  </p><p>Click the ""Create a New Profile"" button, then click Next.

It just opened. Then  I clicked on a shortcut and this opened a new instance of ff (first installing updates, which the main ff icon did not).  I shut them both down.  Clicked on ff icon, this time said not default browser (which I had just recently said it should be).  I again said it should be.  I clicked on a link. It opened a new instance.  I closed the first instance.  Then another link opened in the remaining instance.   </p><p>Closed that instance (so no ff running).  Opened a new instance with my icon.  again asked re default.  Closed that.  Deleted that icon (thinking maybe something’s wrong with that icon).  Opened ff from start menu, same thing (asking re default).  Clicked on a link.  Again new instance.  Again closed both.   But I’ve now tried multiple times opening from a shortcut to a particular url, and then things work fine – i.e. links and shortcuts open in same instance with no “ff running” or profile manager (so far, at least).  But opening from start menu or an icon created from start menu creates an instance that (a) thinks ff is not default and (b) is ignored when links are clicked.  I’m willing to just open it through a shortcut to a url, even if a bit kludgy, if it continues to keep the problem away.  On the other hand, if this strange behavior suggests a clean solution to you, great.  If not, I’ll live with this kludge (but let you know if problems arise, since earlier things seemed semi-solved, but only for a bit).  In either event, I REALLY appreciate the time you have been taking to help me.   (One more non-development; since the main icon seemed weird I closed ff, changed name of the new ini files, opened through a shortcut to a url to see if it would ask anything re ini files – it didn’t – and things are the same as just reported, i.e. opening through said shortcut seems to work, while opening through start menu creates an instance that is ignored when clicking on links.) </p> id:1297816,created:2020-03-15 09:10:25 -0800,updated:2020-03-15 09:10:25 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Let's remove two settings files and let Firefox regenerate them and see whether we can get things working normally again. </p><p>First, please set Windows to show all file extensions: <a href=""https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-show-file-extensions-in-windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-show-file-extensions-in-windows/</a> </p><p>Next, use this shortcut path to access the Firefox folder -- you can paste this into the Windows 10 search box on the Taskbar (or into the Windows Run dialog) and execute it there.

I clicked the Restart normally button.  I then clicked on a link.  Nothing happened with several links (nothing, not ff running or the link opening or anything).  I restarted ff and got the choice of profiles.  I chose my old default.  Now, when I click on a link, it doesn't open the tab, I don't get the ff running message, instead, it tries to open a new instance and I get the profile manager again.  Auuggghhh!!!  I really need to be able to click on links.  I'm perfectly willing to start totally afresh, if there's a way to do that, and reinstall all pwds etc; that will be less work than what I'm going through (and I do appreciate all you're going through with me).  So then I clicked on a link, used profile manager to open the new profile, clicked on another link and it successfully opened in the new one.   So then I tried using profile manager to tell the new profile to load w/o asking.  Then clicking on a link got me the ff running message.   So I accessed profile manager with the –p switch and unchecked that.  Now things seem to be working.  I’ll just manually chose the new profile and add back in all my passwords etc. and hope for the best.

There may or may not be a number on the icon indicating the number of blocked items; you may need to click the button to see what's going on and test whether you need to make an exception for this site. </p><p><strong>Testing in Firefox's Safe Mode:</strong> In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the Shift key when starting Firefox. (On Mac, hold down the option/alt key instead of the Shift key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?""

These are: </p><p><a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> Bing DuckDuckGo ebay Google Twitter Wikipedia </p><p>and for various reasons, I would like to remove ALL of them, and add one, maybe two or three, default search engines of my own choosing and not have to worry about any of the above defaults showing up in an updated or new release of Firefox, EVER. </p><p>For privacy considerations alone, I figure it makes sense to not trust the seven organizations behind those search engines by default.  If I want to search eBay, I can visit that site, but I stopped having anything to do with eBay years ago.  Companies or organizations such as <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>, Google, Twitter and Wikipedia, sell/provide goods and (information) services I USE OFTEN, but at least three of those four are notoriously nosy (read: they do not respect users' privacy) and the other is not all that organized to begin with, so as much as I like and find Wikipedia useful at maybe once a day (?), I would rather open a new window to search it. </p><p>Bing is not something I use except as a last resort when I am trying to find a mainstream search engine which might not be as biased in some way as the most well-known search engine is.  Google Search is often the foundation for other search tools which attempt to make it more respectful of privacy, run faster, etc.  I like DuckDuckGo but it drops all the timestamp information related to the hits it returns, which makes it less than helpful when I want to skim through results looking for those from a certain time frame. </p><p>I actually use Twitter now that it seems to be POTUS' means of choice for communicating directly with the People of the United States of America (and most of the rest of the world, if one is realistic), when he does not want waste a lot of time and effort to make a comment at a formal or even impromptu press conference.  </p><p>The problem I keep having is that after I have tried various means of removing (almost) all of the default search engines in Firefox, and maybe adding a couple of specialized ones that are typically metasearch providers. Within a matter of weeks, all of the Mozilla standard default search engines show up again. </p><p>Besides that major problem, the issue of not having a simple, straightforward way to create new search engine add-ons of my own means it is difficult to, for example, create several custom Google Searches which have different focuses and thus may be much more efficient for specialized purposes; looking for recent news about a particular pandemic but excluding all but a few sources and restricting the results to a narrow time frame. </p> id:1297184,created:2020-03-13 02:00:35 -0800,updated:2020-03-13 02:00:35 -0800,creator:Standard8,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>If this happens again, please could you let us know the name of the of the other engines that appear.

Can it be disabled?,"<p>Hi, </p><p>I like to work with side-by-side Firefox windows, with one of the windows being far slimmer (horizontally) than the other. Since I updated to Firefox 74.0 today, I can't resize the windows as I like to do. I can resize them, but it's like there's a minimum fixed size to what I can resize it to and then it locks and doesn't go any slimmer from there (maybe so the browser controls don't overlap?). That fixed size is far too big for my use case, i.e. I absolutely need it slimmer. I'm not entirely sure if the previous Firefox version contained a fixed minimum size, but if it did, it was much smaller (it allowed controls to overlap, which wasn't a problem for me) </p><p>Is there a setting that I can change in Firefox 74 so that I can make the windows as slim as I require again? </p>",customize;desktop;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;needsinfo;pixelwidth;pixelwidth74;,firefox,customize,en-US,1296574;1296600;1296621;1296919;1297233;1297236;1297245;1297440;1307380;1307391;1307404;1307407;1307414;1307482;1307654;1307663;,edys.email,"id:1307663,created:2020-04-21 19:57:00 -0800,updated:2020-04-21 19:57:00 -0800,creator:dulope,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I'm a Mozilla fan and loyal user but sadly not a programmer or software engineer - I've had to begin the migration of bookmarks and sites to the Brand 'X' browser - Been with Mozilla for over 10 years and it's a heart breaker but the new minimum window size is a deal breaker - I leave with fond memories ............ </p> id:1307654,created:2020-04-21 19:13:16 -0800,updated:2020-04-21 19:13:16 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>The link you posted is not an official guide for current Firefox releases as that is a link to a page that was archived a long time ago and that doesn't apply to current versions.

I need a program running in a window to the side that requires me to keep an eye on images/text as they flash by, and click a button as appropriate. I do need it to be NARROW, and for some reason, Firefox have started preventing me from making the window as narrow as I need it to be. I need it to be at most a quarter-width of the screen width, and it will now only go to a third-width - which is much too thick to be usable with the main window open.  </p><p>This is NOT ACCEPTABLE.  As you can see from the blue background on the second window, which I could previously minimize by sizing the window width even further, there is a ton of wasted space.  </p><p>The sidebar app would work great if I could view the page at this resolution (50%) in it, but that isn't an option. </p><p>I need to view/work in the main window (as in the second image) but you see the problem here?

For some people, it will take a little bit of time to get used to it.  But it still displays the text by hovering your mouse cursor over the icon, so displaying double the text is a redundant action. After a few days you will know what site each icon is anyway, and if you forget, just hover over it.  I chose this form because I use a lot of links, and wanted to display as many icons as I could per row, while still not making my Firefox full screen.  I frequently wrap to 3 rows, and at least 40 icons per row, but normally I'm using only two rows.  I noticed that you can only display 16 icons per row because you like the see the text displayed by each icon too.  That is a chronic waste of space for me.  You can also experiment with the size of the icons - if you want to modify the program yourself?  And since I have a very clear 24"" monitor, the size I made them are right for me, but may be too small for you?  Anyway, experiment a little, that is what I did.  I actually combined 3-4 different scripts together and changed a few lines of code to get it to do what Multi-row Bookmarks used to do.  That is not possible now with the new Firefox to get it exactly like the Multi-row Bookmarks, but my script is very close.  I'm not a programmer, I'm was mainly a hardware engineer in my day job before I retired, but I can generally figure out a few lines of code by modifying them to see how it was changed when I run it. </p> id:1317511,created:2020-05-31 08:45:44 -0800,updated:2020-05-31 08:45:44 -0800,creator:AIVAS1701,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>OK.

For example, when I attempt to browse the youtube homepage, it is as if I never visited the site before; the recommended videos are random and the site defaulted back to the ugly new design. I never log into youtube so restoring that session is the only way to get the algorithm to recommend the random junk I like to watch lol. </p><p>My facebook account was also logged out. </p><p>The session cookies come up when I search for them from the options menu, but the session ID or whatever has likely been changed. Is there any way I can restore the old session cookies from a backup/earlier FF session? Where are individual cookies even stored now? Seems like they're all dumped into some obscure local database within an obscure folder with thousands of files that ordinary users cannot service themselves.  </p><p>I miss the old .txt file approach.

If this is missing, do something on the Youtube page to create it. Just disable autoplay on a video or change the sort order if you are viewing someone's videos in their profile    For PREF, double-click the Value to edit it and replace it with f6=8 or add it to what is already there with &amp;f6=8    Click off of the Value or press enter to save it and then refresh the page.

Then I searched for random things of interest and opened a bunch of those videos as well.

I periodically flush my google/youtube cookie UIDs and start over like this all the time, except I always kept the parameter that enabled the old yt homepage. I'm glad I figured out exactly which one it was (""PREF"") so now I know that is the only one I need to keep between refreshes. </p><p>Naturally this update bug happened on my day off and right after I had already recently reset those UIDs. I work in IT... and am in the middle of contract negotiations on top of that. Instead of much needed rest here I am still working on this problem, hence all the frustration on my part.

Unfortunately I cannot find any relevant cookie data in them at all. Not in cookies.json, not in cookies.bak or whatever it is called, and not in any of the various sessionstore-json-backup files that seem to be created after every update. They literally contain everything BUT the cookie data that I need. </p><p>Looks like I will have to use your webapp to literally decode every one of these json files in my possession (I have lots of backups) and then use forensics software to literally keyword search all of them.... just to get the youtube homepage to display properly.  </p><p>Nothing quite like doing hours of unpaid labor to restore basic functionality to a web browser in 2020. I appreciate all the new features and whatnot but the whole Apple-esque idiot proofing and nigh-unserviceable overcomplicated session stores kind of defeat the purpose IMO. I thought FF was supposed to be an alternative to browsers like Safari and IE that you need to either know assembly language in your sleep to fix or pay the company $$$ so their product can then immediately break again as soon as your coverage expires lol. </p><p>I did find an article on how to change the youtube style back to the old one by modifying a single cookie parameter. At least that works now, but all the recommended videos that show up are still the same pop garbage on TV nowadays and I think I'm going to vomit. Literally.  </p><p>Also tried using third party extensions (ie cookiebro) but all they do is display existing info and are useless for loading cookies from those json or session files. Oh and yes I have one called session resurrection that was supposed to backup my entire session. Tried restoring from that and of course the backups are gone. Pretty sure that is due to the extension itself being trash rather than a FF problem though. </p> id:1296537,created:2020-03-10 11:08:14 -0800,updated:2020-03-10 11:08:14 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Using a database for cookies is not new.  </p><p><em>Perhaps an add-on or third party utility could read cookies from your older cookies.sqlite database.</em> </p><p>Losing session cookies in a regular update is unusual.

When maximizing a window I get a large white bar blocking the entire header-menu area of the browser. Have attempted cycling the browser through fullscreen with F11 and Dev mode with F12. Have completely restarted the browser in and out of SafeMode with the same issue present. Additionally I can interact with the webpage however I cannot interact with any of the menus in the white bar in fact I actually select the icons on the desktop behind the bar. My computer is setup with one 1080p monitor and one 1440p monitor; this bug only appears on the 1440p screen. Going to restart and see if that solves the issue however I wanted to make a note of this error as it appears to be recurring throughout the past few years. Last detail is I am running Windows 10 and all drivers are up to date.

Often when I start it I am told that I need to wait to use my computer because firefox must update itself. Annoying, presumptuous, but expected.

No bookmarks, no passwords no toolbars or buttons.

So instead of going on my pc and performing a simple task that takes about 90 seconds, I am stuck trying to either sort of this mess that has been dropped in my lap and sync my settings and hopefully be able to get back everything I can't access right now.
