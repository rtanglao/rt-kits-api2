But here are some things to consider: </p><p>(1) If you gave the site permission to show notifications or use your camera, etc., you can go through the Permissions section of the Options page and remove those exceptions. As an example, see: <a href=""/en-US/kb/how-manage-your-camera-and-microphone-permissions"" rel=""nofollow"">How to manage your camera and microphone permissions with Firefox</a>. </p><p>(2) If the site pushed an add-on for you to install, you can view, disable, and often remove unwanted or unknown extensions on the Add-ons page. Either: </p> <ul><li> Ctrl+Shift+a (Mac: Command+Shift+a) </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Add-ons </li><li> type or paste <strong>about:addons</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return </li></ul> <p>In the left column of the Add-ons page, click Extensions. On the right side, find the ""Manage Your Extensions"" heading. (If you don't have this heading, you probably don't have any extensions installed.) </p><p>Then cast a critical eye over the list below that heading. Any extensions Firefox installs for built-in features are hidden from this page, so everything listed here is your choice (and your responsibility) to manage. Anything suspicious or that you just do not remember installing or why? If in doubt, disable (or remove). For your privacy and security, don't let mystery programs linger here. </p><p>(3) If the site pushed a file for download, it should appear in your Download history. You can access that by pressing Ctrl+j, or through the menu button &gt; Library, or through the Library toolbar button.  </p><p><strong>If you ran a software installer or opened an untrusted document:</strong> you may want to scan for malware. This support article lists good tools to supplement your regular security software: <a href=""/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-caused-malware"" rel=""nofollow"">Troubleshoot Firefox issues caused by malware</a>. </p><p>(4) If a site popped up a warning about viruses with a toll free number to call, that's usually BS and a scam to sell you support services. If you engaged with that company and allowed them any kind of access to your system, see #3 above. </p><p>(5) If the site didn't make changes to your browser or computer but asked for account information for another site, it may have been a ""phishing"" attempt. If you think a site might have sneakily stolen a password for an important account, make sure to change the password -- through a trusted address -- ASAP. </p><p>Does that cover it, is there anything else you are concerned the site might have done? </p>"

Bookmarks Toolbar (as attached in the screenshot cut, Amazon, GMX, GM toolbars - what are they called?) in the past when FF was upgraded automatically I lost not only these toolbars but also all the text bookmarks and could not restore them until I reverted to the old FF version # 60. Are you sure if I let FF upgrade now from 60 to latest version, I will be able to conserve my bookmarks and Bookmarks Toolbars with icons as partially depicted in my screenshot? </p><p>P.S.: I have downloaded the update, and it processed as it seems, but after I rebooted my PC I see not only all my Bookmark Icons gone as per below image but also text bookmarks are gone and there are no more text links at the top of the browser!? So how do I use it and how do I restore all my lost info? It asked me to log into my FF account, so I did but the bookmarks etc, did not return! This is what I was afraid of. Please advise how do I restore the 60 version of FF in my PC? I absolutely dislike this new 69 version. </p><p>OK, so I activated the Bookmarks Toolbar, but this is all new one, but what happened to my years and years of bookmarks icons and my text bookmarks? Are they lost? How to restore them without reverting to an older version of fox browser? This is really nasty surprise, by ""upgrading"" one loses all OLD and IMPORTANT (!!!) bookmark icons and bookmarks!? Really? Firefox will lose customers really fast this way. </p><p>P.S.: I have been using Vivaldi browser, since FF will not print any documents for me and is crashing on print attempts. </p> id:1324433,created:2020-06-16 01:50:48 -0800,updated:2020-06-16 01:50:48 -0800,creator:anamika02jnv,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>hello, </p><p>Make sure that toolbars like the ""Navigation Toolbar"" and the ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" are visible: ""View &gt; Toolbars"" </p> <ul><li>  If items are missing then open the Customize window via ""View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize"" </li><li>   If a missing item is in the toolbar palette then drag it back from the Customize window on the toolbar </li><li>  If you do not see an item on a toolbar and in the toolbar palette then click the ""Restore Default Set"" button to restore the default toolbar set up.  </li></ul> <p>See also: </p><pre>* <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Toolbar_customization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Toolbar_customization</a> *  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.com/kb/Back+and+forward+or+other+toolbar+items+are+missing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.com/kb/Back+and+forward+or+other+toolbar+items+are+missing</a> </pre> id:1324430,created:2020-06-16 01:33:24 -0800,updated:2020-06-16 01:33:24 -0800,creator:yogytakalwar04102002,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hii ,, </p><p>If you were using the Bookmarks Toolbar for quick access to your favorite bookmarks and the toolbar is now missing, you may have turned off the option to display the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Of course this isn't a problem when the page is going to a printer, but yes, PDFs captured that way have no searchable text. </p><p>If you use a converter that reads the text of the page and generates the PDF directly from the HTML -- not through printing -- then you can avoid this problem. However, I have not been keeping up with the best add-ons for that and you need to consider privacy if they do the conversion on a website instead of on your computer. </p><p>Another workaround is to change the fonts before printing. This is not practical if you need an exact copy of the page, but if it's for your reference, why not? Also, you can capture it both ways if you like. I created an add-on that includes switching webfonts to basic fonts for this purpose if you want to take a look (it's the third button on the drop-down): <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/printable-the-print-doctor/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/printable-the-print-doctor/</a> </p>"

I mean i do not want to learn a new programming language to have a nice beautiful theme on the buttons etc. In old Firefox there were addons/themes for this. You added them and that was it! In new Firefox it seems the user has to use workarounds and learn programming language stuff.

That can be done with the powerful Tab Mix Plus addon in old Firefox. </blockquote> <p>Is the purpose of hovering instead of clicking to avoid having to find the previous tab and make it active again? </p><p>Generally speaking, a WebExtension can't take an action merely because a user hovered over a built-in control. However, it could provide a separate list of tabs to replicate this ""peeking"" (temporary activation) function. </p> <blockquote> b) When i right click in the page i had the option to save all images of this tab/of all tabs in the left or right and saving them in ANY FOLDER of my preference. I can do that with the Save Images 1.3.0 addon in old Firefox. </blockquote> <p>The WebExtensions APIs limit disk access so extensions can only save <em>automatically</em> in your downloads folder or subfolders of that folder. </p><p>(Note that a WebExtension can coordinate with a separately installed companion program as a workaround to this limitation.) </p> <blockquote> c) There was a display closed tabs list button that if you click it <strong>ONCE </strong> it makes the most recently closed tab to load and when you click the tiny ânear it, you had a list of recently closed tabs you could choose anyone to reload.  </blockquote> <p>So you're saying that the built-in menu paths are too long? For example: </p> <ul><li> (menu bar) History &gt; Recently closed tabs &gt; {list} </li><li> optional History toolbar button &gt; Recently closed tabs &gt; {list} </li></ul> <p>There might be an extension which gives you a more direct route, but I've never gone looking for one. </p> <blockquote> d) How to make buttons more customizable(bigger) and with colors and themes?

Two problems, one of which I've found a workaround for and one I haven't. </p><p>1 The Recommended by Pocket tickbox that's supposed to be in about:preferences#home isn't there in my browser (FF 77.01 Windows 10 laptop). That whole entry as described in the help pages simply doesn't exist. I've managed to get the Recommended by Pocket section to appear on my NTP by manually turning it on in about:config, but obviously I'm not supposed to have to do that. So why is it missing in my Options page? </p><p>2 Where's the UK stuff in the results? The FF 77.0 release notes announcing recommended by pocket now available for users in the UK links to a Mozilla blog entry that says: </p><pre>'What does this mean for Firefox users in the UK? Open a new tab every day and see a curated selection of recommended stories from Pocket. People will see thought-provoking essays, hidden gems, <strong>and fascinating deep-dives from UK-based publishers both large and small</strong> â and other trusted global sources from across the web.' </pre> <p>Well I'm not seeing any articles from UK-based publishers of any size, just US ones. And yes my FF language is set to English (United Kingdom), and browser.search.countryCode and browser.search.region in about:config both show GB. So where's the UK content? </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1324035;1324066;1324147;,DavidGB,"id:1324147,created:2020-06-15 06:40:35 -0800,updated:2020-06-15 06:40:35 -0800,creator:DavidGB,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>That pref was set to false.

So my problems as such are solved for me, though not other UK users. Clearly something  was messed up in the rollout of Recommended by Pocket to UK users for me to have to go into about:config and find settings in there to change manually to get the feature working. </p> id:1324066,created:2020-06-14 21:23:55 -0800,updated:2020-06-14 21:23:55 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Did you check this pref on the <b>about:config</b> pageÂ ? </p> <ul><li>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.feeds.section.topstories = true </li></ul> id:1324035,created:2020-06-14 18:29:15 -0800,updated:2020-06-14 18:29:15 -0800,creator:DavidGB,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I added GB onto the US,CA value of browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.discoverystream.region-layout-config and also onto the 	US,DE,CA value of browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.discoverystream.region-stories-config in about:config. I now have the Recommended by Pocket entry in Options&gt;Home and a few UK articles. So It appears the problem is that Mozilla didn't change the config settings during the FF 77 update to allow UK users to access recommended by Pocket despite it being declared as a main feature of the update. </p><p>And, out of the 21 articles presented, THREE are from British sources and one Irish. The rest American. Not very impressive given what they said in that blog entry. </p>"

Both of us are using Win 10 (his is 18##, mine is 1909), both using Firefox 77.0.1. When he tried to Present his screen, Firefox presented the various popups and permission pages I've seen in the answers here and on on the web.

Which is fine, but it was giving me the exact same thing before I discovered the Meet URL &gt; right click &gt; Connection Secure &gt; More Information &gt; Permissions described above and pictured in one of the attached images showing I set it to Always Ask, which seems to be contrary to FF insistence that it won't allow me to permanently share. </p><p>When I once again try to Meet &gt; Present &gt; Window, I get the pop-up saying I have to give permission, thus throwing me back into the same frustrating loop. </p><p>Doubly frustrating is that my friend can share his screen going through the same steps I did, but he gets the pop-downs I see on the web that talk about ""only share in trusted sites"".  I have never been presented with those pop-downs, even after closing all my tabs, clearing my cache and closing my browser for a bit. </p><p>I thought Meet would be easier for some of my less-than-computer-literate friends and family to use, but I need to be able to share my screen with them as well as they theirs with me. </p><p>Halp! </p>",firefox-770;privacy-and-security_1;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1324076;1324217;,melissk,"id:1324217,created:2020-06-15 09:58:43 -0800,updated:2020-06-15 09:58:43 -0800,creator:melissk,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Good question, cor-el!

1291153,2020-06-14 04:50:27 -0800,2020-06-15T02:39:09Z,Fed up with  Firefox Favicon and desktop URL icon problems,"<p>I run FF in 2 Windows PCs Both running Win 7 Pro., one is 32 bit the other 64 bit. The win7_64 PC is used with developer apps and UAC is turned off, although there is other 3rd party browser protection running. </p><p>Both PCs have been running FF version 56 with all the tools and addons I know and love.  I also have a link to standalone chrome (dirty word) on each desktop. With more sites going HTTPS with higher security FFv56 was struggling with certificates. I upgraded the 32 bit PC to latest FFv77. The menue bar shows the Favicon in the top right corner for each site visited but when the URL is highlighted and dragged from the locked padlock it appears on the default Win7 blue background as the Firefox icon on a white background. Although I'd prefer the Favicon, I can live with that. </p><p>The Win7_64 no UAC PC running v56 has the same FF icon on a white background. I decided to uninstall V56 from Windows programs and install the latest V77. </p><p>The install finished with all the bookmark links as before (good) but the entire desk top of two monitors full of url links was changed to the FF icons with a BLACK background. On a pale blue screen this is a nightmare garish issue. I over came the first problem of not being able to drag urls by using the launcher switch -no-deelevate. The existing icon links stayed as FF icon on a black background.  </p><p>Then I went to Monitor display settings changing from 32bit to 16 bit colour rebooted and all the desktop links changed. (strange). After reading FF support guidance I changed UAC from zero to default, rebooted and just about everything on the desktop changed with Windows error messages popping up for applications.  I reverted back to AAC and the previous position. </p><p>O.K so now my option was to try an absolutely clean re-install of FFv77. To do this isn't so easy. I searched and found the Mozilla folders and profiles, but there was still an awful lot left in the registry including some keys from previous FF updates and versions. After cleaning that out manually the Win7_64 was as clean of Mozilla as I could make it. Installed latest FFv77 which booted to the default profile but all the existing desktop url links came back with black backgrounds - Horrible! </p><p>Throughout all of this, I can install and open Chrome (still with no PC UAC) and browse o.k, with no surprise changes to desktop links, problems accessing SSL protected sites or having to add custom switches to a startup launcher.  I don't know if my problems are Windows OS related or Firefox new versions have problems with Win7, but there is none of this with Chrome straight out of the box and the issue of Firefox icons and Favicons keeps being raised by others. Some may be able to put up with the black background URL links but when you have a screenful across two monitors IMHO it is really horrible. </p><p>I have an image backup to FFV56 and I'm willing to try something else. What is the default for the FF desktop URLs after a new build, is it a Favicon, Firefox icon on a black background or the same on a white bckground - or something else? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;desktop;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1323848;1324092;1324094;,Jimbo100,"id:1324094,created:2020-06-15 02:39:09 -0800,updated:2020-06-15 02:39:09 -0800,creator:Jimbo100,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>PS: There's no PNG image reference in the file headers of cached links which show the FF default icon on a black or white background. </p> id:1324092,created:2020-06-15 02:31:53 -0800,updated:2020-06-15 02:31:53 -0800,creator:Jimbo100,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Update: I did some more digging. Favicons for most sites are shown on the FF tab but these are not used when a URL is saved to my desktop. I used a hex editor to look at my desktop links and these all point to ' ShortcutCache' in my FF profile, with each link having a unique file reference to the URL and icon. When I open the ShortcutCache folder in Windows I see the desktop links with their associated favicons for each link exactly as displayed on the desktop. I can see FF icons on a white background for older links imported from a previous FF profile, the same size icon with a black background for links recently added with FF77 and a mixture of actual Favicons showing in different icon sizes. </p><p>I can change an individual link icon by modifying the link properties but only for Windows default icons available in the dll shell. If I use Chrome standalone and save a URL to my desktop I get the same small FF icon on a black background. I suspect this is because my default browser is set to FF? </p><p>My conclusions so far is FF links are using icons sourced from its own executable and NOT from Windows which is why you can't find them. The Favicons showing correctly on FF tabs are displayed from within the FF application and it's only when a FF URL link is saved to the Windows desktop that something goes wrong and this is seen in the shortcutCache folder.  </p><p>As far as I know, favicons are additional bytes included with the URL address, so I'm wondering if Windows security or screen settings stop some of them from rendering correctly? The default small FF icon on a black background is horrible to look at when you have a screen full. If Windows security is responsible for favicons not showing and FF substitues a default icon, at least please allow it to be changed to something more aesthetic because it is generated by the firefox app.  </p><p>This favicons issue seems to have been ongoing for years and I've not yet read a good reply as to what's going on, how to fix the problem or at least replace the FF default icon with something else. </p> id:1323848,created:2020-06-14 04:52:34 -0800,updated:2020-06-14 04:52:34 -0800,creator:Jimbo100,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Typo: Favicon appears in top LEFT corner. </p>"

Most users will only have one profile listed there, but you likely have many (one for each time you started Firefox). </p><p>To correct this, the <code>firefox.app</code> file from within the DMG file needs to be copied into the <code>Applications</code> folder on your computer.

It seems somehow to be tied to that advertising page instead of the built-in page. I don't know where Firefox picked that up, but try fixing the setting first and see whether that helps.

Normally a new installation doesn't have any extensions, so it's not likely you'll find anything here, but when anything strange is going on, it's worth a look. You can view, disable, and often remove unwanted or unknown extensions on the Add-ons page. Either: </p> <ul><li> Ctrl+Shift+a (Mac: Command+Shift+a) </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Add-ons </li><li> type or paste <strong>about:addons</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return </li></ul> <p>In the left column of the Add-ons page, click Extensions. On the right side, find the ""Manage Your Extensions"" heading. </p><p>Then cast a critical eye over the list below that heading. Any extensions Firefox installs for built-in features are hidden from this page, so everything listed here is your choice (and your responsibility) to manage. Anything suspicious or that you just do not remember installing or why? If in doubt, disable (or remove). For your privacy and security, don't let mystery programs linger here. </p><p>Any improvement? </p> id:1323876,created:2020-06-14 08:54:02 -0800,updated:2020-06-14 08:54:02 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><a href=""/en-US/user/McCoy-thereal"" rel=""nofollow"">McCoy</a> said </p> <blockquote> ReÂ : Â  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1291095"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1291095</a><br>  Could it have anything to do with this (?):<br>  <a href=""https://malwaretips.com/blogs/mypc-backup-virus-removal/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://malwaretips.com/blogs/mypc-backup-virus-removal/</a><br>  Also see Â  <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00OkrHMPKoRNV1DZY9VDWQshtSNKA%3A1592140787671&amp;ei=8yPmXuO6KIuckgWP967IBw&amp;q=in+firefox+%3A++how+to+get+rid+of+MyPCBackup&amp;oq=in+firefox+%3A++how+to+get+rid+of+MyPCBackup&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQRzoHCCMQsAIQJzoGCAAQBxAeOgQIABANOggIABAIEAcQHjoGCAAQDRAeOgYIABAIEB46BAghEApQ71RYspQBYJibAWgAcAF4AIABU4gB3BGSAQIzMpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijgNPQsoHqAhULjqQKHY-7C3kQ4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5"" rel=""nofollow"">these search results ..... </a> </blockquote> id:1323855,created:2020-06-14 06:07:16 -0800,updated:2020-06-14 06:07:16 -0800,creator:mark196,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank-you jscher2000 and thank-you also Arman Khan and Fred McD. </p><p>I am 62 years old and  relatively new to computers so please forgive my slow understanding of your sound advice. </p><p>Jscher........So yes, yesterday I took your advice and downloaded the ""full"" or offline installer through the link that you gave me.

Like any extension that modifies the page body (as far as I know), it cannot modify certain pages and sites, such as <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org</a>. For obvious reasons, it can also not modify PDFs opened in Firefox' built-in viewer.

That is beyond the power of a pin. </p><p>Would a desktop icon work for you?  If so, try this: - Go to Google Classroom in your FF. - Resize FF so you can see some of the desktop, too. - In the address bar, click down on the little lock, drag it to the desktop (you'll see the whole address come along with it), and then let go.  This should put a new shortcut on your desktop that will go to Google Classroom when you double-click it. </p><p>HTH. </p><p><br> Jeff </p>"

The mouse cursor changes to a ""loading"" cursor and starts flickering forever, trying to start Firefox. This is bad enough for my whole system to behave strangely, e.g. mouse clicks will randomly not register or release. </p><p>Upon inspecting the task manager, I find that `consent.exe` repeatedly pops up and disappears. I assume it crashes and then firefox tries to restart, repeating in an infinite loop ... I only recently found a dubious/hacky way to stop this without logging out or restarting my pc: When I forcefully rename `C:/Windows/System32/consent.exe` via console, e.g. to `.../consent.exe_`, Firefox will crash ""properly"" with an error message and I can rename it back. </p><p>I have no idea what this `consent.exe` does or why it is called, which makes finding the cause or fixing the issue very hard.. </p><p><br> <strong>Details / attempted fixes</strong> </p><p>The most recent time I had this issue, it appeared after trying to open an external link while Firefox was open. Firefox then found a new update and started automatically updating to the newest version (77.0.1), before trying to open the link and giving an error message (I don't remember what it was..). To properly apply the update I closed Firefox, tried to open it again, and I started getting this infinite crash loop. </p><p>This is not the first time I had this exact same issue, but the cause seems to vary. The first time I encountered this was back when there was a buggy Windows update, which if I read my logs correctly seems to have been at the end of February 2020. As far as I can remember at this time, the issue appeared immediately after restarting my PC and updating Windows (no opening of external links involved). The only way I managed to fix it was by uninstalling that Windows update. I disabled the following updates for some months. At this time I assumed the cause was the buggy Windows update, but since then I had the same issue 4 more times. Of the times I can remember the issue appeared immediately after </p> <ul><li> updating windows </li><li>Â ?? </li><li>Â ?? </li><li> clicking an external link </li><li> clicking an external link &gt; automatic Firefox update &gt; restart Firefox &gt; crash </li></ul> <p>Every time I got this issue I tried many things to fix it, including </p> <ul><li> restarting Firefox </li><li> restarting the PC </li><li> deleting my Firefox profiles in `%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` and `%AppData%\..\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` </li></ul> <p>none of the above worked any time I had this issue - nonetheless the issue would disappear randomly without me knowing what fixed it. </p><p>The first time when it was seemingly caused by the buggy Windows update, I even uninstalled and reinstalled all of Firefox, including deleting my Profiles in AppData. Even then, the issue persisted on a completely clean and barebone install of Firefox. However, since then it is seemingly caused by opening external links and the problem always randomly disappeared before I got to try a clean Firefox install. </p><p>The most recent time, the issue disappeared while I was trying `firefox.exe --version`, `firefox.exe --help` to find out my Firefox version (I don't know the correct commands, so nothing happened). This did not work, but when I then tried to start Firefox again, I got about 10 or so error messages on the first attempt (unfortunately, I don't remember the error message..), and then the issue was gone on the second attempt to restart Firefox. </p><p>One other random guess I have is that some of my about:config settings may be related, in particular I completely disabled any links from opening popups, be it a new tab or window. But this sounds really like a bug and I certainly do not want to undo this setting. </p> <hr> <p>In the end I am not even sure if this is a Firefox or Windows issue, and I am also not sure what would be a better place to look for support. Should I submit the above as bug report? </p><p>I am also very reluctant to try to reproduce the issue since I have no idea what the fix is and spent hours on it every time. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1323316;1329855;,chris237,"id:1329855,created:2020-07-04 10:14:57 -0800,updated:2020-07-04 10:14:57 -0800,creator:chris237,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I reply after some months, as I just got the same issue once again after opening a link via script.

Except it did not open (again, same script worked many times over the past months), and put my cursor into the infinite-load/crash-loop as described in my first post. </p><p><br> Thanks @FredMcD for the tip to try fix corrupted files, I tried this exactly as described in <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a>, but the output of the last command was ""Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."", and it did not help. </p><p>So again began my attempt at fixing this issue with basically zero information what is going on .. thankfully I fixed it rather quickly this time, but again I do not know which of the steps, if any at all, were the crucial ones. Since I played around with renaming constent.exe the last times, I thought I can somehow ""fix"" it with similar steps. Here is what I did this time as soon as the issue appeared: </p><p>1) close firefox &amp; all other programs 2) rename consent.exe to force it to crash 3) restore consent.exe to original name 4) restart pc 5) try to start firefox -&gt; issue not fixed, appeared again 6) repeat steps 1-4 7) this time, rename consent.exe before trying to start anything 8) try starting other programs to check if they work, namely the Mail app &amp; google chrome. No issues, they work. 9) Try to start firefox (consent.exe is still renamed so cannot be found) -&gt; I get an error as expected, reporting that ""firefox.exe"" (which I just clicked on in the firefox installation directory) could not be found. Ok .. weird error? 10) Rename consent.exe back to original name 11) Try to start firefox -&gt; from here on it works again </p><p><br> Again I do not know which or if any of these steps were necessary.  Unfortunately ""Consent.exe is a file of Windows operating system that has administrator-level access to files and settings"" does not help me much, I guess I do not know enough about how the OS starts the program and/or what steps of it are specific to firefox, as other programs seem to work even if consent.exe does not exist. </p><p>Since as far as I can tell no system files are broken, the only possibily I can think of is that there is some buggy ""state"" flag/variable/setting of some sort that causes the issue. But I do not know where this could be.  As described in my first post, I did try reinstalling firefox, so it could not be in the installation dir. I also tried deleting my profile directories, so it could not be there either. The registry is the only other place I know that stores any settings, but I have no idea what to look for in here. </p> id:1323316,created:2020-06-12 10:37:31 -0800,updated:2020-06-12 10:37:31 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><a href=""https://www.bing.com/search?q=consent.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bing.com/search?q=consent.exe</a><br> <em>Consent.exe is a file of Windows operating system that has administrator-level access to files and settings</em> </p><p>Perform a System File Check to fix corrupted system files </p><p><strong>Win 7, 8, 10, Vista:</strong> <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a><br> <strong>Win XP:</strong> <a href=""https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-xp-scan-and-fix-disk-errors/6fe2827a-4be6-4bc1-8083-5139b5aa3a3d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-xp-scan-and-fix-disk-errors/6fe2827a-4be6-4bc1-8083-5139b5aa3a3d</a> </p><p>Wiki - Windows 10 System File Check <br> <a href=""http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"" rel=""nofollow"">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</a> </p>"

Any difference? </blockquote> <p>Hi, I want my browser UI at 125% but regular website text at 100%. I set my Windows scaling to 125% in display settings (that sets my browser UI to 125%) and in chrome I can just set default zoom level to 80% and that makes the website text and popups 1.25 * 80% = 100% again. The same works for Firefox, except for the add-on popups. The problem is those popups do not respect the default zoom level (80%). When I force them to show in tabs using the moz-extension:// urls, they are correctly sized (80%), but when in side bar or in popups, they are still 100% (with 1.25 scaling making them 125% in effect). </p><p>Since I've set UI scaling to 125% in Win10 OS settings, setting layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 1.25 does not do anything. if I set layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 1, then the browser UI is too small (again I want my browser UI at 125% but regular website text &amp; popups at 100%). I guess my use case is a wired one. Hopefully I made my problem clearÂ :) </p> id:1323604,created:2020-06-13 07:55:58 -0800,updated:2020-06-13 07:55:58 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>On a regular old Full HD monitor, the extension popup text size is very similar to the text size in toolbars.

It saved my bookmarks, history, and the handy little bookmark toolbar at the top of the page that I could just click my top visited websites.

I started it up, saved certain websites for my bookmarks and put my most visited websites up at the top of the page (enabled bookmark toolbar). I thought all was well until I exited out and started Firefox again. All of my information was gone, including my bookmarks and bookmark toolbar. There's an option to create a Firefox account, so I did that thinking it would solve the problem. Repeated all steps from before with my bookmarks. Exited out and started Firefox again, everything gone. Noticed I was signed out of my account, signed back in; everything gone. Also, same annoying startup pages as if I had just downloaded it. </p><p>This is so infuriating! I want to keep using Firefox because I liked it so much before, but not if these crap keeps happening!

On conspicuous and inconvenient result has been the disappearance from the upper toolbar of the several items that allow one to control the use of the browser in various ways:  File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools, Window, Help.  Access to some of these functions has evidently been relocated to small icons appearing in the upper right-hand corner of the browser-window.  Some, however, seem to appear nowhere.  Of particular annoyance to me personally are the following:  Previously (a) under ""File"", the ""New Tab"" opener seems nowhere to be found--as far as I can see, one can only open a ""New Window""; (b) under ""Edit"", the ""Undo"", ""Redo"", and ""Delete"" functions seem nowhere to be found.  Finally, is there no way to restore the previous much more accessible and versatile presentation of these functions in the toolbar of the desktop, rather than having them tucked away in the browser-window? </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1323105;,wgb.888,"id:1323105,created:2020-06-11 20:41:39 -0800,updated:2020-06-11 20:41:39 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>This is a known bug on Catalina where you only see the Firefox menu label and all other labels are missing. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1603956"" rel=""nofollow"">Bug 1603956</a> - Racing for the same prototype document causes others to receive an untranslated prototype and then cache it </li></ul> <p>(<i>please do not comment in bug reports<br><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html</a></i>) </p>"

I could then just middle-click to paste the URL elsewhere for further use (eg, into an email). Anyone who uses X regularly knows that this is an essential core feature and part of everyday workflow. </li></ul> <p>This new auto-selection feature does not appear to work properly with X copy/paste: it seems that I now have to <strong>triple-click</strong>: </p> <ul><li> once to activate the urlbar (and (only) ""select"" the URL),  </li><li> again to unselect the URL,  </li><li> and, finally, a third time to re-select the URL and trigger the X select/copy function. </li></ul> <p>Is there a way to revert the previous behaviour, so that the urlbar is only ""activated"" with single-click, and requires double-click to actually select/copy the URL? </p>",customize;desktop;,firefox,customize,en-US,1322927;1322928;1323038;,dmoz1,"id:1323038,created:2020-06-11 16:22:16 -0800,updated:2020-06-11 16:22:16 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Unfortunately it isn't possible to revert to the previous state used on Linux where clicking once didn't visually select the URL. </p><p>In particular on Linux a single click selects all without primary selection, a double click selects a word, and a triple click selects all with primary selection (bug 333714#c32) </p><p>The two clickSelectsAll prefs are no longer supported in Firefox 75 and newer and you will have to get used to the new behavior. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1621570"" rel=""nofollow"">Bug 1621570</a> - browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll=false has no effect since 75b1 </li><li><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333714"" rel=""nofollow"">Bug 333714</a> - browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll should default to true on all platforms [75] </li></ul> <p>(<i>please do not comment in bug reports<br><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html</a></i>) </p> id:1322928,created:2020-06-11 09:48:23 -0800,updated:2020-06-11 09:48:23 -0800,creator:feer56,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello, </p><p>You may have seen a post or received a notification regarding support for Firefox or Thunderbird with a link to another site or a phone number being posted.

Here are two other steps we often recommend: </p><p><strong>Firefox's Safe Mode</strong> </p><p>In its Safe Mode, Firefox temporarily deactivates extensions, hardware acceleration, any userChrome.css/userContent.css files, and some other advanced features to help you assess whether these are causing the problem. </p><p><em>If Firefox is not running:</em> Hold down the option/alt key when starting Firefox. (On Windows, hold down the Shift key instead of the option/alt key.) </p><p><em>If Firefox is running:</em> You can restart Firefox in Safe Mode using either: </p> <ul><li> ""3-bar"" menu button &gt; ""?"" Help button &gt; Restart with Add-ons Disabled </li><li> (menu bar) Help menu &gt; Restart with Add-ons Disabled </li></ul> <p>and OK the restart. </p><p><em>Both scenarios:</em> A small dialog should appear. Click ""Start in Safe Mode"" (<em>not</em> Refresh). </p><p>Any improvement? </p><p><strong>New Profile Test</strong> </p><p>This takes about 3 minutes, plus the time to test your problem site(s). </p><p>Inside Firefox, type or paste <strong>about:profiles</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it.  </p><p>Click the ""Create a New Profile"" button, then click Next. Assign a name like June2020, ignore the option to relocate the profile folder, and click the Finish button.  </p><p>After creating the profile, scroll down to it and click the <strong>Launch profile in new browser</strong> button. </p><p>Firefox should open a new window that looks like a brand new, uncustomized installation. (Your existing Firefox window(s) should not be affected.) Please ignore any tabs enticing you to connect to a Sync account or to activate extensions found on your system so we can get a clean test. </p><p><em>Do the problem site(s) work any better in the new profile?</em> </p><p>When you are done with the experiment, you can close the extra window without affecting your regular Firefox profile. (June2020 will remain available for future testing.) </p><p>IMPORTANT: Creating a new profile may change your default. If your regular profile has a <strong>Set as Default Profile</strong> button after this test, click that to make sure your next startup doesn't yield a surprise. </p>"

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, GNOME 3.28.2 with a 64-bit OS.  </p><p>Recently, I noticed that I could not save PDFs from the internet to my hard drive when I was using Firefox. Normally, if I had opened a PDF in Firefox, I could press 'Ctrl + S' on my keyboard and a save dialog window would appear. Now however, the save dialog window would not appear. No error messages appeared, so I have no screenshots to show. The only thing I could do to save the PDF was to click on the 'Download' icon in Firefox's PDF reader. Right-clicking on links to PDFs and selecting 'Save As' would yield the same result: no save dialog window, nothing. </p><p>I thought that the problem might be because my version of Firefox was not up to date, so I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install firefox' in the terminal. I also updated the flash plugin.  </p><p>Afterwards, I noticed that I could not upload files from my hard drive as an attachment for e-mails.

It works just fine with the same setting (I sync my Firefox across all my devices).

I am really good at the command line except for checking library dependencies.Â :/ </p><p>Last link shows these 5: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item    GTK+ 3.4 or higher </li></ul> <pre>   * Bulleted list item    GLib 2.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    Pango 1.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    <a href=""http://X.Org"" rel=""nofollow"">X.Org</a> 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended) </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item        libstdc++ 4.7 or higher </li></ul> <p>My fear is i'll have to search around a while for the exact package name since sometimes capitalization and dashes matter when using apt, aptitude, or synaptic. </p><p>Here's what I am trying so far.   I started with libstdc++ since that's all lower case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $ apt list | grep libstdc++ | grep -v unstable ... ... (super long list of lots of different libstdc++) ... libstdc++6/stable 8.3.0-6 i386 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So since that ends with version 8.3 and that's higher than the ""4.7 or higher"" in the official list above, then I'm good. (By the way, just a plain `apt list libstdc++` returned no results.) </p><p>And substituting the word 'pango' in the above command gives a similarly long list that looks good, i think. Same with 'gtk3', 'glib2', and 'xorg'. </p><p>Oh, i think i've answered my own questionÂ :) but maybe went the scenic route with my command since i did not know the exact package names. </p><p>Anybody have a faster way of checking for these?  Pretty please?Â :) </p><p>P.S. By the way, I'm using Debian but in my experience it wouldn't matter if i was using Arch or even one of the BSD's right now.  Yes, tools are slightly different like apt/dpkg, or ports but am mostly curious for what exact package names to search for to save me time.Â :) </p><p>Thanks, you all rock.

How do I reach someone who actually works for Firefox?,"<p>Firefox randomly logs out of sites even when I've left the tabs open, and this week there have been problems with re-entering and resetting all the passwords. (Which is a HUGE waste of time and will keep Firefox from being my default browser when I get a laptop with enough working memory left to run anything else.) With Google and Twitter the password issues wasted only about half an hour, but with Yahoo there's still a problem. It looks as if Firefox is trying to re-enter the e-mail address into the password field even when I've typed in the password. Could this be a problem with Firefox rather than Yahoo?

Ideally, I want to have two Firefox windows open simultaneously.

I'd be able -- just by switching to a different Firefox window -- to switch between these two ""workspaces"", without needing to log out of one and log into another.  Maybe I could even synch each workspace with the matching ""user"" on my Android phone, which is set up with two users, each tied with a diff email account. I could accomplish most of this by using different browsers for each workspace, but I've been using Firefox since forever, am most comfortable with it, and would love to use it for both.

To give it a try: </p><p><strong>New Profile Setup</strong> </p><p>This takes about 3 minutes, plus the time to test your problem site(s). </p><p>Inside Firefox, type or paste <strong>about:profiles</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it. You probably want to bookmark this page. </p><p>Click the ""Create a New Profile"" button, then click Next. Assign a name like <em>Work</em>, ignore the option to relocate the profile folder, and click the Finish button.  </p><p>After creating the profile, scroll down to it and click the <strong>Launch profile in new browser</strong> button. </p><p>Firefox should open a new window that looks like a brand new, uncustomized installation. (Your existing Firefox window(s) should not be affected.) Please ignore any tabs enticing you to connect to a Sync account or to activate extensions found on your system to avoid cross-contamination. </p><p>You can change the theme so when you switch windows it's immediately obvious which is which. See: <a href=""/en-US/kb/built-themes-firefox-alternative-complete-themes"" rel=""nofollow"">Built-in themes in Firefox - alternative to complete themes</a>. </p><p>If there is particular data you want to migrate, we can drill down to specific options and files, but for now, does this look like the kind of arrangement that will work for you? </p><p>You can launch the Work profile from the about:profiles page whenever needed, and you can close all windows of the Work profile without affecting your regular profile. </p><p><strong>However:</strong> this first time, on the about:profiles page, make sure to restore your regular profile to being the default profile by clicking its <strong>Set as Default Profile</strong> button. Otherwise, Firefox will start up with Work instead, which is a viable option, but probably not what you want as the standard setup. </p><p>What do you think? </p>"

I have done a <em>complete</em> reinstall multiple times, wiping any and all traces of Mozilla from my system before running the installer again. I have run antivirus scans, and attempted to start Firefox with my antivirus (Avast!) completely disabled. I even tried starting firefox.exe from the command line, using tab completion to ensure that the file existed. No matter what I do, I get an error message from Windows claiming that it can't find firefox.exe, even when this is the result of double-clicking that exact file. This does not happen for any other software, including the portable version of Firefox (which is useless, since nothing is saved and I need my addons). I'm beginning to think that this is the result of either an absurd mistake or deliberate action from Microsoft, as there has been more than one Windows update within the day, and I have noticed other weird issues like my desktop background occasionally just being removed from existence for no reason. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;avast;avast77;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1322344;1322738;1322746;,phyreoligarch,"id:1322746,created:2020-06-10 20:11:38 -0800,updated:2020-06-10 20:15:49 -0800,creator:phyreoligarch,updated_by:phyreoligarch,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I marked the registry tweak as the solution to this, as it is the only possible explanation for the issue.

I attempted to launch Firefox each time that the strictest scan provided by one of the antiviruses finished, but nothing changed. The last scan had just finished with no hits when I saw the response about the registry. I immediately opened regedit and navigated to the provided path, only to find nothing related to Firefox, Mozilla, or ""Debugger"". I then tried to launch Firefox one last time, and it worked. The only virus scan that I ran between when the issue was still present and when it resolved itself returned no results, so it probably didn't cause this. </p><p>My hypothesis is that the entity that caused the issue (be it Microsoft, Avast!, or someone else) realized what had happened as a result and tried to patch the issue as quietly as possible by pushing a silent update that nuked the problematic registry entries.

I use a NEC P221 wide gamut monitor, and I'm aware of the over-saturation issues with wide gamut monitors.  I'm on a 2011 Mac Mini using High Sierra 10.13.6.  In the past when this issue has come up, I'd use the about:config command to adjust Firefox's color management settings.  When I tried adjusting it for the new upgrade, I haven't been able to correct the problem. I tried using different values for the settings and also tried supplying the exact monitor profile name pathway to replace the ""gfx.color_management.display_profile"" setting.  </p><p>Iâve attached a screen shot of my current settings.

Instructions on how to do this in about:config for previous versions no longer work. Thanks. </blockquote> <p>Hi Mike, well, currently you need to use custom style rules in a userChrome.css file to tame the enlargement. That might be a foreign language to you, but stick with me. Although there are several steps and it might take 10 minutes, you can do it. </p><p>(For anyone who already has a userChrome.css file set up, you just need to add the rules you downloaded under (A) to your file.) </p><p><strong>(A) Download a rules file</strong> </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</a> </p><p>Use the downloads list on the toolbar to open the downloads folder directly to the new userChrome.css file. (See attached screenshot) </p><p>Minimize that file browser window for later reference. </p><p><strong>(B) Create a new</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder in your profile folder</strong> </p><p>The following article has the detailed steps for that (#1, #2, and I recommend #3) </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </p><p><em>I have videos for both Windows and Mac in case the text is not clear.</em> </p><p><strong>(C) Move the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file you downloaded in Step A into the</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder you created in Step B</strong> </p><p><strong>(D) If you do not already have a</strong> <code>userChrome.css</code> <strong>file, Rename the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file</strong> </p><p>Highlight userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css and choose Rename (using whatever method Finder offers). Carefully remove <code>-ZeroEnlargement</code> and press Enter to save your change. The final file name needs to be userChrome.css or Firefox will never find it. </p><p><strong>(E) Set Firefox to look for userChrome.css at startup</strong> -- see step #6 in the above article. </p><p>The next time you exit Firefox and start it up again, it should discover that file and apply the rules. </p><p>Success? </p><p>Once you start tweaking the interface this way, you'll probably find more and more things you want to do. I suggest bookmarking the pages where you get the code for future reference because changes to Firefox may break them and it's easier to request an update if you can find the source. </p> id:1322084,created:2020-06-09 10:48:54 -0800,updated:2020-06-09 10:48:54 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi mike.porter1, please ignore the spam message with a phone number -- that's not official and we don't know what they will do to your system if you engage. </p> id:1322078,created:2020-06-09 10:32:44 -0800,updated:2020-06-09 10:56:41 -0800,creator:denit66375,updated_by:,is_spam:true,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Please contact expert on this number 1-833-581-0504 (Toll-Free) and they will help you right away. </p>"

So all that's left to consider now is to communicate this to PortableApps and/or Mozilla in the hopes that the PortableApps version can be better coordinated for the sake of those wishing to use the fine features and concepts of PortableApps. Meanwhile, for such system-centric programs as a browser, I'm content with having the full installation on my system,especially since I can apparently set it to auto-update as well. </p><p>Finally, I'm amazed at how elegant, efficient and customizable tte Firefox browser is! I will be a supporter of it and the concepts behind Mozilla.

Mozilla Firefox becomes very slow for Google-based services (Google Search, Gmail, YouTube) and unresponsive when HTTP3 is enabled in about:config. Since QUIC is mostly a Google invention and Google services are the ones that utilize it the most, I wonder if Google deliberately slows down Firefox-based QUIC. The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services.

1290432,2020-06-09 04:08:22 -0800,2020-06-09T06:23:41Z,Display Problems while scrolling in Firefox,"<p>Hello, I am using the latest version of Firefox (77). In this version, but also all the previous versions, I have a problem while scrolling long web pages. Once I have scrolled down quite a bit to far below the immediately visible area, there will be a horizontal area across the entire browser window that does not show anything or is blacked out. It appears as if that area is covering up the info below it (as in a lower layer).  If I continue to scroll further down, these blacked out areas appear regularly. This forces me to switch to another browser (Chrome, Edge) where the problem does not occur, just so that I can read that info or access the buttons etc. hidden in FF.  I am working with a Lenovo Laptop attached to a docking station and two extra 27 inch screens that are turned to vertical and stand side by side.  The attached Screenshot gives you an idea. It was taken from this page: <a href=""https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/</a> with the parameter for number of items to display in the table below the map set to ""Alle"". The blacked-out area appears 8 or nine times. The page is only an example - the problem occurs on just about every page that requires a lot of downward scrolling. And the problem is also unrelated to a specific website. I can easily replicate it on this news portal aswell: <a href=""https://www.spiegel.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spiegel.de/</a>  </p><p>Does anyone have an idea how to fix this?

So this is how it happened. First I opened normal Firefox with all the tabs intact. Then I opened a private window and closed the main Firefox. Then from the private Firefox I opened a new window and all the tabs were gone.  </p><p>I thought they were just gone in that particular window but when I restarted Firefox again but all the tabs were really gone. Since I had cleared all the history earlier I couldn't recover them. </p><p>In Opera this doesn't happen. When I open a normal Opera window from incognito mode, it too opens a window without all the tabs, but all the tabs are restored once I restart Opera again. </p><p>Is there a way to not lose tabs. </p><p>Regards </p>",firefox-770;tabs;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1321947;1321954;1321958;1321959;1321962;1322057;,BubbaDaCaveman,"id:1322057,created:2020-06-09 09:43:40 -0800,updated:2020-06-09 09:43:40 -0800,creator:BubbaDaCaveman,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>@ANAMIKA KUMARI, I am testing the 'Tab Session Manager' addon.

I have been a dedicated user Firefox browser for years, and one day it comes to a grinding halt.  Not sure how or why this happened.  Did someone have a bad day, and decided that that was the day that every Firefox user had to have a password to use the software?  I lost all my bookmarks because apparently my password (which I did not have) was the only way to access them and resetting my password meant of course they are gone.  Really sad, as the Chrome browser is a pig - why does EVERY web site you ever accessed have to stay open?? Weird!!   Is there a description somewhere of how to navigate the new Firefox.  I have tried to get somewhere using the 3 boxes that open in the initial screen but they are dead ends.  Odd but then most of the stuff I see is ""Intuitive"".  I will be 75 in a week, so I don't do intuitive!!  Help.  Jim  </p><p><em>[Personal information removed by moderator.

I am not a computer or IT person, just someone who began using PC's for his business back in 1984 to help ""modernize"" my 3 person automobile repair shop business, in those days an ""early adopter"" with PC's in an office environment that small. Over the years it became a hobby for me. <br> BTW, my mother was able to learn how to use Firefox back when she was in her mid-80's. Surely it was a struggle <em>(for both of us)</em>, but she was able to actually use Firefox almost as well as WordPerfect for ""word processing"", which she had been using for many years when working PT long after she first ""retired"". </p><p><br> </p><p>As far as losing your Bookmarks goes, am I correct in assuming that you were using the Firefox Sync service? <br> And that ""password reset"" had to do with Sync and a Firefox Account? </p><p>If so, that is an optional service and not necessary to use in order to actually use Firefox. I do have to say that Firefox is ""marketed"" in such a manner that to a user that is not an option, but make it sound mandatory for everyone to be using. <em>IMO, marketing hype.</em> What Mozilla fails to mention is that for Sync to be used properly two separate devices are needed for ""synchronizing Firefox user data"". One device alone would be like ""clapping at air with one hand"", good arm / wrist exercise and the two hands produce the audible noise: IOW, there's nothing to synchronize with - it takes 2 (or more) devices for real ""synchronization"".  And Sync was never intended to be a ""backup medium"" for a solitary device, The manner with which the Password is used to encrypt user data for ""off of the device security, is a primary feature that few users ever read about or realize. And that is why ""merely"" forgetting the Password for a Firefox Account and resetting setting the Password results in the user losing their data.  </p><p>Unfortunately, that is ""fatal"" for your data, it's gone. And without a backup file that would have been made before hand, there really isn't any way of getting them back.   </p><p>Please start here to learn about Firefox and learn how to use it. <br> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/get-started"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/get-started</a> <br> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-started-firefox-overview-main-features"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-started-firefox-overview-main-features</a> <br> </p> id:1321846,created:2020-06-08 21:20:39 -0800,updated:2020-06-08 21:20:39 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Well, first off, happy early birthday to you, Jim! </p><p>Did this issue first happen after some kind of update to Firefox? </p><p>It sounds like maybe you were asked to sign into Firefox Sync, which is a service that can be used to share your bookmarks, passwords and other settings between more than one device. This service is entirely optional, so it's not something that you <em>need</em> to sign into in order to use Firefox. </p><p>What it sounds like is that maybe Firefox updated to a new version on your computer and this caused Firefox to misplace your bookmarks and other settings. When a user first installs Firefox, they get a popup to create a Firefox Sync account, which is probably what you saw. It's not entirely uncommon to see this happen and, usually, it's pretty easy to fix. </p><p>Often what happens is that, when Firefox updates to a new version (typically if it hasn't been updated in a while), it thinks that it's now the first time that you are using Firefox for the first time. This causes it to create a new profile on your computer. A profile on Firefox is just the folder that your bookmarks and settings are stored in. </p><p>Fortunately, Firefox doesn't usually delete the old profile folder from your computer. It just sets the new one as the default one to use with Firefox. </p><p>What you can do, to check if Firefox does indeed still have your old profile folder, is go to the <code>about:profiles</code> page in Firefox. This can be done by typing that into the Firefox address bar at the top of the screen. That page will list all of the profile folders that Firefox can see on your computer. </p><p>If you see more than one listed there, it's likely that what I've described above is exactly what happened in your case. One of the profiles will be labelled as ""in use"". That's the one that you are currently using. If you press the <strong>Launch profile in new browser</strong> button, that will open a new browser window and you can check in there to see if it has your bookmarks and passwords and other data. </p><p>If it does, go back to the original browser window and press the <strong>Set as default profile</strong> button. Then, once you close Firefox, it should have all of your bookmarks and other data when you open it up again. </p> <hr> <p>As for the rest of your question, it sounds like perhaps you have some questions or issues using the Firefox layout. It's potentially different from your old layout, especially if you were previously using a very old version of Firefox. </p><p>If you are able to recover your old profile using the information above, but the layout still looks unfamiliar to you, let us know what features you are having issues using or finding and I'm sure either myself or someone else here in the community will be able to help you out or even help you to customize Firefox the way you want it. </p><p>Hope all of this helps. If you need anything explained further or need additional help, please feel free to reply to this thread. </p>"

I have also tried resetting Firefox without any success.  </p><p>I have another computer running Windows 10 with Firefox 76.0.1, so I confirmed that I could access the router with that version of Firefox and it worked fine.

I noticed the issue by checking the ""Show password"" box when Firefox asks if I want it to save the password - the password shown was missing the last character. If I manually typed the password, the router would allow me to login. This problem manifested in Firefox 77 due to a new feature to truncate pasted text.

I understand that you can change (add, remove) search engines but I really want one of the developers to make Firefox more privacy based and for the newer users who didn't know what DuckDuckGo was before to learn more. That means setting DuckDuckGo as Default search engine and showing other privacy based Search engines like Searx or Startpage instead of the privacy Intruding Google.

I can no longer use Firefox to pay online with StateFarm.  This started suddenly a few months ago. I had no problem navigating to the payment login page with State Farm, then one day I clicked the link and received an error page. I called State Farm Technical service and they suggested I try another browser.  It works fine in Chrome.  I like exclusively using Firefox.  Can this link be made to work on Firefox again? 2.  All of a sudden Firefox stopped opening links in webpage.  It doesn't open a new tab, it doesn't open Adobe Acrobat.  All I get is a flash of the download arrow.  I then need to go through multiple steps to download/open/save whatever it is I'm looking for.  If I don't see the flashing download arrow, it just looks like nothing has happened.  I'm assuming this change came in some update recently.  I have looked in options, but don't see how I can reset the options so links open automatically.   3.  In Options, I noticed a banner iYour browser is being managed by your organization.  I use Avast.  Your article about this suggests turning off Avast for web browsing, but that is advice in direct opposition to my computer guy.  I don't care about the banner if I know why it's there.

1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,2020-06-08T12:02:11Z,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"<p>I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"". This comparison exemplified that resource consuming from inside and outside looks very different. The second conclusion is that network usage ten or more times lower than disk usage, which should not be even if content is unpacked and saved. And the main question is why disk usage are close to memory consuming. This speaks in favor of the fact that disk usage is inefficient and surplus: most data can be stored in memory. Let's consider the attached screenshots. The first part of screenshot 'Firefox external metrics@77.0.1' consists of two parts with ProcessHacker window and contains the following external metrics of the parent firefox process: </p> <ul><li> Working set = 2 GB (summed over children processes) </li><li> Virtual size = 3.25 GB </li><li> Network total bytes = 287.1 MB </li><li> Disk total bytes = 3.02 GB </li><li> Disk write bytes = 2.48 GB </li><li> Disk read bytes = 551.23 MB </li></ul> <p>The firefox process structure is in the second part of that screenshot. The same observation -- excessive resource consuming exemplified by the same metrics. To estimate total memory consuming, I closed Firefox and compared memory usage by ""System information"" (ProcessHacker's tool): the commit charge level decreased by 4.2 GB and the physical memory level decreased by 2.7 GB. This means that 1.5 GB memory pages are in the paging file, i.e. stored on the disk! In comparison with Windows 7 memory consuming, we see 748 MB versus 2.7 GB in physical memory. Does Firefox indeed execute so many tasks and provide so many functions and deliver so much value as Windows 7 Pro operating system? The comparison Firefox versus MS Word 2010 with 20 opened documents (about 200 MB RAM consumed) leads to the same observation: the former has much higher resource consuming per functionality/value. </p><p>However, Firefox's ""about:cache"" and ""about:performance"" don't report such resource consuming: see the according screenshots. I summed memory usage by web pages enumerated in ""about:performance"": all 16 loaded web pages consumed 522 MB in total instead of 2.7GB physical memory and 4.2 GB virtual memory. What does Firefox really do?! This is why I suppose that Firefox executes hidden extraneous tasks. To those who would like to analyze Firefox's memory report in detail, I saved and published it: <a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg</a>  </p><p>My point is that disk I/O operations should be decreased significantly in order to prevent Firefox from hanging and to decrease response time on user actions. There are several measures to do it. First, stop using RAM in uncontrolled and ineffective manner as we saw it even on 16 web pages. This means estimating and measuring memory overhead per content byte, per user-level function and per delivered value. Second, stop using disk-based databases, use in-memory databases instead. Third, use effective data structures and data architecture. To prevent memory page unloading, use OS API to disallow unloading of desired memory pages using proper attribute. Yes, if your data/programming languages do not satisfy these critical requirements, use another one. If your data/programming technology do not satisfy these critical requirements, just change it. If your values interfere with this approach, then make the browserâs mission to be the main value -- visualizing hypertext to the user quickly, cheaply, conveniently and effectively. All other values around it have lower priority, remember! No one need safety and transparency and so on if the browser hangs with other process in the system or web page loads more than 0.5 second on a real device. This means you should not suppose the modern or superpower device -- you should suppose any device with one CPU of 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM. These resources are enough to display even 100 pages of 1 MB each in size, obliviously. Just because 1920x1600 = 3072000 bytes (one byte per pixel), i.e. about 3 MB per screen image. The main thing the browser do is it transforms 1 MB of input content into 3 MB image of output. Five or eight GB of RAM is too excessive to this operation, isn't it? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321683;,alexworad,"id:1321683,created:2020-06-08 12:02:11 -0800,updated:2020-06-08 12:02:11 -0800,creator:mbox.shashank,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello Aleksey F., You can submit feature requests at: </p><p>Firefox Input <a href=""https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/</a> </p><p>And there are also contact links here: </p><p>Contact <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/</a> </p>"

It's a little bit involved, so please set aside 10 quiet minutes to work through it. </p><p>(For anyone who already has a userChrome.css file set up, you just need to add the rules you downloaded under (A) to your file.) </p><p><strong>(A) Download a rules file</strong> </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</a> </p><p>Use the downloads list on the toolbar to open the downloads folder directly to the new userChrome.css file. (See attached screenshot) </p><p>Minimize that file browser window for later reference. </p><p><strong>(B) Create a new</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder in your profile folder</strong> </p><p>The following article has the detailed steps for that (#1, #2, and I recommend #3) </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </p><p><em>I have videos for both Windows and Mac in case the text is not clear.</em> </p><p><strong>(C) Move the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file you downloaded in Step A into the</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder you created in Step B</strong> </p><p><strong>(D) If you do not already have a</strong> <code>userChrome.css</code> <strong>file, Rename the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file</strong> </p><p>Right-click userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css and choose Rename.

Sync is intended to be used to two computers, not as a ""backup media"" where you turn in one computer when you leave the store with a new computer. </p><p>Same versions of Firefox or not, <strong>if</strong> you did something that may seem as innocuous as changing the Firefox Account password your data is ""just gone"" and lost to what I call the ""tron gods"". And few people don't read the <em>(too small, IMO)</em> warning message and just 'blow it off' only to have found that their Firefox data was gone.  </p><p>That type of issue typically arises when a user misuses Sync by not doing a proper ""real backup"" of their Firefox data instead AND not seeing and/or reading that warning message. </p><p>And the only thing more that I can think right now, is to ask if you ever saw a message that the initial Sync event was completed appear in Firefox? </p><p>Beyond that is advice that depending upon the amount your data that was sitting on the Sync server is that the time needed for the first Sync event on a new PC with Firefox freshly installed can take more time than many people might expect it to take. And to try again and see if as long as a half an hour helps to retrieve your data. But you changed the password for your Firefox Account as I suspect,  ""all hope is lost"". That is a ""fatal"" error that  can't be fixed by anyone.

I am also not alone in this matter because as soon as the change was established, communities popped within hours to fix the problem. The old way of fixing this eyesore of an issue was the old about:config and changing around the settings then VIOLA! back to normal.  Now after the update to 77, the Megabar is back and forced down everyone's throat and the old about:config is no longer the fix to this terrible experience. Literally after an hour of this trashbar being up, videos and guides popped up to try to fix it. Whole communities have been formed to hate this feature and ask Firefox to change it, or at least make it optional to go back.  My question is, looking through google has only come up with the chrome.css(?) fix to this mess. Is there any way to change it back to the old url bar without having to go through the chrome.css fix or just uninstalling and reinstalling a previous Firefox or do I have to just migrate to another browser like Opera or Chromium? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321449;1321451;1321460;1321467;1321590;1321789;1321792;1322832;1322866;1322892;1322903;1322922;1322937;,quizibo,"id:1322937,created:2020-06-11 10:18:38 -0800,updated:2020-06-11 10:18:38 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>OhFirefoxSake <a href=""#answer-1322922"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> The userchrome solutions here, apparently advocated by Mozilla reps, </blockquote> <p>To be 100% clear, modifications to the UI via userChrome.css are not officially supported.

I didn't like it when it was defaulted to being on starting with version 75 but I was able to easily switch a few setting in about:config to fix it. Those settings no longer affect the address bar as of update 77. </p><p>The settings I had changed were: </p><p>browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus browser.urlbar.update1 browser.urlbar.update1.interventions browser.urlbar.update1.searchTips </p><p>which were all set to false. I saw that setting ""browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests"" to ""true"" might be the solution but, while it does stop the address bar from expanding when using it, it also stops it from expanding at all so the websites that would come up from searching can no longer be seen either (they are still called and using the down arrow will let me scroll through the results, I just can't see any of them). It also doesn't fix the results issue which I would say is the most important. </p><p>I would like to know what I need to do so that: 1. The results it shows me are no longer based on frequent visit (basically, the pre-update search system, as is they are scattered and look messy, pulling many different sites in a seemingly random order and it's not particularly useful) 2. It no longer autocompletes results (IE. ""F"" autocompleting to ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"", this is always something that has bothered me regardless is context) 3.

Those matches should be based on the standard criteria and still work the same. Let me know if there's a problem with those.</blockquote> <p>I'm not sure if you're talking about the address bar or the search bar. I have the two separated and the search bar is fine. </p><p>The problem is the address bar. While it's possible that the current and previous setups are pulling the same results (unfortunately I can't exactly go back and check) even if that is the case, the way they are shown is scattered and looks almost random. For example, typing ""x"" into the address bar brings back: </p><p>1. Google slides document (it has a few X's in the URL) </p><p>2. A different site </p><p>3. The same Google Slides document but a different page </p><p>4. Google Slides </p><p>5+6. Other sites </p><p>7+8+9. Google Slides </p><p>Again, I can't go back and check but I don't recall the results displaying in this order even assuming it is pulling them in the same way. It's not even based on which I visited or clicked on last since clicking on different results from that list sent it up to the 2nd or 3rd position rather than the first. </p><p>However, I don't think it is since, for example, typing in ""P"" would normally bring up the the aforementioned Google Slides document since the title starts with ""P"" and it would display all of the pages before anything else. While that still is the first result, it's also the only one with the rest being a number of other sites. On top of this and going back to the issue above, I'm not even sure why it's pulling the sites it does in the order it does because the second result is a site I visited once in the past 2-3 months and has 3 P's (2 in the title, 1 in the URL) while the 8th result is one I visit 2-3 times a week and has 4 P's (3 in the title, 1 in the URL). Both start with P in the title as well. So, at least from what I'm seeing, the results being pulled are different. </p> <blockquote>Yes, you can prevent Firefox from showing matches in the address bar itself, so they are only shown on the drop-down. Here's how:  (1) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.  (2) In the search box in the page, type or paste <strong>URLB</strong> and pause while the list is filtered  (3) Double-click the <strong>browser.urlbar.autoFill</strong> preference to switch the value from true to false  <em>More info on about:config:</em> <a href=""/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">Configuration Editor for Firefox</a>. </blockquote> <p>This was fixed, thank you. </p> <blockquote> Yes, many of us think it expands more than necessary. You can use an optional <strong>userChrome.css</strong> file to prevent the enlargement of the address bar box. It's a little bit involved, so please set aside 10 quiet minutes to work through it.  (For anyone who already has a userChrome.css file set up, you just need to add the rules you downloaded under (A) to your file.)  <strong>(A) Download a rules file</strong>  <a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</a>  Use the downloads list on the toolbar to open the downloads folder directly to the new userChrome.css file. (See attached screenshot)  Minimize that file browser window for later reference.  <strong>(B) Create a new</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder in your profile folder</strong>  The following article has the detailed steps for that (#1, #2, and I recommend #3)  <a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a>  <em>I have videos for both Windows and Mac in case the text is not clear.</em>  <strong>(C) Move the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file you downloaded in Step A into the</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder you created in Step B</strong>  <strong>(D) If you do not already have a</strong> <code>userChrome.css</code> <strong>file, Rename the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file</strong>  Right-click userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css and choose Rename. Carefully remove <code>-ZeroEnlargement</code> and press Enter to save your change. The final file name needs to be userChrome.css or Firefox will never find it.  <strong>(E) Set Firefox to look for userChrome.css at startup</strong> -- see step #6 in the above article.  The next time you exit Firefox and start it up again, it should discover that file and apply the rules.  Success?

The results it shows me are no longer based on frequent visit (basically, the pre-update search system, as is they are scattered and look messy, pulling many different sites in a seemingly random order and it's not particularly useful)</blockquote> <p>The <strong>browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus</strong> preference controls whether a list opens automatically when the cursor enters the address bar. With true it does, with false it doesn't. The automatic list shows the first 8 Top Sites from the new tab page. I think many (most?) people have been ignoring the Top Sites section so the initial list seems strange. You can clear out unwanted sites from that list to let it be purely history-based, or you can fill it with the sites you want quick access to. More info in this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/customize-new-tab-page"" rel=""nofollow"">Customize the New Tab page</a>. </p><p>When the automatic list is disabled, how do you summon the ""classic"" list? Unfortunately, there is no way to restore a ""Show History"" button to list frequently visited URLs. However, if you type a space (tap the spacebar) then Firefox will drop down that classic list. Can you get used to that? </p><p>By the way, I assume there isn't a problem with suggestions once you start typing some text. Those matches should be based on the standard criteria and still work the same. Let me know if there's a problem with those. </p> <blockquote>2. It no longer autocompletes results (IE. ""F"" autocompleting to ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"", this is always something that has bothered me regardless is context)</blockquote> <p>Yes, you can prevent Firefox from showing matches in the address bar itself, so they are only shown on the drop-down. Here's how: </p><p>(1) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk. </p><p>(2) In the search box in the page, type or paste <strong>URLB</strong> and pause while the list is filtered </p><p>(3) Double-click the <strong>browser.urlbar.autoFill</strong> preference to switch the value from true to false </p><p><em>More info on about:config:</em> <a href=""/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">Configuration Editor for Firefox</a>. </p> <blockquote> 3. It no longer pops out/expands when in use (admittedly this is mostly an aesthetic issue but I still don't like how it looks) </blockquote> <p>Yes, many of us think it expands more than necessary. You can use an optional <strong>userChrome.css</strong> file to prevent the enlargement of the address bar box. It's a little bit involved, so please set aside 10 quiet minutes to work through it. </p><p>(For anyone who already has a userChrome.css file set up, you just need to add the rules you downloaded under (A) to your file.) </p><p><strong>(A) Download a rules file</strong> </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</a> </p><p>Use the downloads list on the toolbar to open the downloads folder directly to the new userChrome.css file. (See attached screenshot) </p><p>Minimize that file browser window for later reference. </p><p><strong>(B) Create a new</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder in your profile folder</strong> </p><p>The following article has the detailed steps for that (#1, #2, and I recommend #3) </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </p><p><em>I have videos for both Windows and Mac in case the text is not clear.</em> </p><p><strong>(C) Move the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file you downloaded in Step A into the</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder you created in Step B</strong> </p><p><strong>(D) If you do not already have a</strong> <code>userChrome.css</code> <strong>file, Rename the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file</strong> </p><p>Right-click userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css and choose Rename. Carefully remove <code>-ZeroEnlargement</code> and press Enter to save your change. The final file name needs to be userChrome.css or Firefox will never find it. </p><p><strong>(E) Set Firefox to look for userChrome.css at startup</strong> -- see step #6 in the above article. </p><p>The next time you exit Firefox and start it up again, it should discover that file and apply the rules. </p><p>Success? </p><p>Once you start tweaking the interface this way, you'll probably find more and more things you want to do.

I'm working to save people's lives against COVID-19, and Firefox, not Chrome is causing ALLof my gmail accounts to quickly and automatically sign out. For almost a month, and with great diligence and frustration in trying to troubleshoot this a couple of different ways (according to Mozilla and others)), nothing has prevailed.  </p><p>Could it be the great number of open windows and tabs that cause it, because that is my last (but not yet tested theory).  Most of the times the sign out occurs when the email draft automatically saves itself, and the site disconnects. How I know this, is gmail says it's trying to reconnect. There's also a message saying my hangouts isn't signed in, but neither is it signed in with Chrome  One more thing. Every day for the last 3 years, I use CC cleaner to remove cookies and cache, so it can't be that. You'll have to come up with something Mozilla hasn't yet thought of yet. </p><p>And lastly, Firefox Lockwise (when it was active), prevented me from finding my ""SAVED LOGINS"", gmail account. Not even the search engine could find it (both when Lockwise was active, and after I cancelled the account). This program prevented me from finding my own password, which was needed urgently. And now, I can't get rid of Lockwise, even after cancelling the account. Anf from what I see, I'm forced to sign up with the account again, just to ask this question. Nobody likes the bully, so please help me PERMANENTLY remove Lockwise from my system?

I searched for a way to remove it, found a solution that involved turning these to false: browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus browser.urlbar.update1 browser.urlbar.update1.interventions browser.urlbar.update1.searchTips It solved my problem, had the bar back to the way I wanted it the day after the update rolled out and its been fine up to this point. Today, I'm using Firefox and the browser closed abruptly, so I clicked to reopen it and get an update. Once its done that awful bar is back again and its telling me to send a crash report. I send the report then go to reapply the solution I used before only to see that they are all still set to false but that bar is still popping out and my easy access drop down of sites I visit most is gone. Please, can anyone help me get rid of this bar. I've tried restarting the browser and no luck. I need a way to return it to how it was, I've tried using the new address bar, don't like it, and I do not want it at all.

1290135,2020-06-07 00:24:26 -0800,2020-06-07T10:37:52Z,Certain websites aren't loading correctly,"<p>Long winded setup to the current problem: I updated to Firefox 77 today. I hated the URL bar that was added in 75 and found it back again in 77 so I tried to turn it off again. After finding that the only solution effectively broke the URL bar (switching browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests to false for reference which stopped it from expanding at all, including to see the websites in the drop down) and no other setting changes did anything, I tried going back to version 76 since the URL bar remained as I had set it in 75. However, because of the profile protection, I would need to manually add everything back (on top of that, I couldn't restore the URL bar with the changes that worked in 75 anyway) so, deciding it wasn't worth the trouble, I updated back up to version 77. </p><p>Now, a few websites aren't loading correctly. For example, YouTube only loads gray placeholder boxes and the sidebar elements are completely unresponsive. Trying to load a video from history also doesn't work as the page just remains blank. YouTube isn't the only site with this issue either though they have varying degrees of functionality. However, I don't know why those sites aren't working while others that I would think are somewhat similar (IE. DeviantArt, Reddit) are working. While I don't think anything I changed in the about:config had anything to do with this as I only went through the URL stuff, I don't know for sure and is why I included the little backstory above. </p><p>I've tried refreshing the tab as well as closing Firefox completely and reopening it but the issue has persisted. </p><p>I tried uploading an image of what YouTube looks like.

The file actually exists on the disc until its space is overwritten by new information. Until that happens, you have a chance to recover Word documents. Recovering Word Documents after a Crash </p><p>Recovering Word documents that didnât save doesnât always stem from user errors. Whether your system unexpectedly went down or Microsoft Word crashed, Word documents can be recovered if you quickly search for the lost files before other files can take their disk space. </p><p>open ms word 2016 </p><p>recover word document after crash </p><p>1.

Paste the copied file into the folder that pops up and open the file to recover it. Did You Know? </p><p>One of the most common reasons for Microsoft Word crashing is corrupt add-on or template. If your program consistently crashes, try running Word without any of these features loaded to see if that helps to improve reliability. Recovering Word Documents through Data Recovery Programs </p><p>If none of these methods help you recover unsaved Word documents, your best bet is either backup software or data recovery software. </p><p>As always, the most secure and reliable way to recover data is with regular full image backups. Whether you use a Windows PC, a Mac, or a mobile device, having up-to-date backups ensure that you donât lose your files â no matter what. </p><p>That said, if you didnât have a backup plan in-place and active when you lost your Word document, you wonât have a backup to restore the file from. </p><p>In this case, data recovery programs (also known as undelete tools) like Acronis Revive are the best way to locate, assess, and recover Word documents. Acronis Revive is a simple, easy-to-use program that allows you to search the entire contents of your system to locate the lost file, assess whether it can be restored and recover MS Word documents with just a few clicks. </p><p>Acronis Revive automatically searches through internal drives, external drives, and memory cards for the localized file names that have gone missing. When the file is found, itâs potential for successful recovery is assessed. If the tool determines that it can recover unsaved Word documents successfully, it will create an exact image file and restored access to it in a matter of minutes. Final Thought </p><p>With Acronis Revive, whether your Word doc was deleted, encrypted by malware, or corrupted when it was saved on a faulty partition, there are a few simple steps you can take to recover the file. Some are built into the operating system, while others require a bit more digging. But, when armed with an undelete tool and regular backups, your docs can be recovered quickly and easily. </p> id:1321058,created:2020-06-06 22:42:49 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 22:42:49 -0800,creator:armanmailbox1,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>hello sonpal.son, </p><p>Please try the following: </p> <ol><li> Open the Firefox Options window </li><li> Select the Applications tab </li><li> Locate Portable Document Format (PDF) on the list of file types </li><li> Change the Action to Preview In Firefox </li><li> Click Ok </li></ol> <p>This should allow you to preview most files in Firefox.

It's especially helpful when I only have one monitor. There are a couple of rough-edges I'd like to see tweaked. </p><p>1. I resize these windows all the time to put them where they'll fit when I'm doing something else, and it can finicky to resize the window quickly. It would be helpful if the areas you can grab the edges and corners of were exaggerated. For example, if when the user's mouse is near an edge or corner of the picture-in-picture window a handle pops-up around the given area that's larger than the 1pixal-ish default handle area. I've seen similar functionality in the art program GIMP for selection boxes. </p><p>2. The way the window acts when being resized isn't very intuitive. The corners work as expected, but since the corner areas are so small I often grab the sides and that can get frustrating. I now know that when grabbing the Bight and Bottom sides of the window the Top-Left corner is anchored while resizing. Similarly, when grabbing the Left and Top sides of the window the Bottom-Right corner is anchored.  That seems pretty intuitive when I type it out, what's the issue? Well, the problem comes when you are grabbing the window near the corners. If for example, I'm trying to grab the window by the Bottom-Left corner and miss (which I've done plenty) and grab the Bottom of the window. Now when I resize the window is anchored in the Top-Left instead of the Top-Right, which is the opposite of what I wanted and leads to some confusion and repositioning. What I would suggest, separate from the #1 solution, would be to break the sides of the window into three areas: Near-corner 1, Center, and Near-corner 2. When grabbing the window on the edge in one of the Near-corner areas, anchor the window at the opposite corner. When grabbing by the center of an edge anchor the window by the opposite center.  </p><p>Thank you for reading my long suggestion. I hope you don't find this to be a negative interaction. I truly enjoy Firefox, and I've very excited about your new Picture-in-picture feature. I hope you understand that this level of nit-picking can only come from a place of love!  </p><p>P.S: I'm very pleased to say that I did not include a third issue I had with the Spacebar Play/Pause functionality not working unless the Play button was the last object clicked on the window, because in the latest update it was gone! I want to thank whomever worked on that and let them know, someone did notice, and they appreciate it! &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-7;feature-request;,firefox,customize,en-US,1321030;,darkkenchi,"id:1321030,created:2020-06-06 20:42:18 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 20:42:18 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi, </p><p>The people who answer questions here, for the most part, are other Firefox users volunteering their time (like me), not Mozilla employees or Firefox developers. </p><p>If you want to leave feedback for Firefox developers, you can go to the Firefox <em>Help</em> menu and select <em>Submit Feedback...</em> or use <a href=""https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a>.

Someone acknowledged that changing the OpenViewOnFocus will no longer correct the tab locations and suggested a userChrome.css change.

And lately <strong>css</strong> has been broken in small pieces and sometimes with every version release that comes out. Firefox 75 and then again with Fx 77 happened to affect the address bar. Plus some of the preferences that were added for Fx75 were temporary and were removed with Fx77, something that the developers have been doing from time to time for a couple of years now.   </li></ol> <p>Personally, if I were a software programmer I would have started with a clean sheet of paper with building Quantum rather than deciding to ""fix"" the code base in this piece-meal fashion, which is taking too long <em>(too many years thus far, with no end in sight)</em>   to reach the end with a ""new Firefox"". I said that that 20 version releases ago with Firefox Quantum 57 and still feel so now even more so. IMO, too many ""self-inflicted"" small injuries will eventually ""kill the patient"" as exsanguination would, just takes much longer and is more painful as it slowly happens.  </p><p>Overall, imo userChrome.css is now is expected to far more that what it was intended for back in the early days of Netscape, then the Mozilla Suite from which Firefox was derived.  I have only been a user since 9/2002, before the name Firefox was placed upon this web browser in 2004, and I started employing a userChrome.css file in late 2003 for very minor tweaks and later to hide context menu items that I didn't even use, to pare the contextual menu down to keep it from ""bouncing off the bottom of the browser window"" with the number of extensions that I was using back in those days. </p>"

See the attached screenshot comparison. </p><p>So there is some kind of communication snafu between Firefox's HTTP/2 and IIS10 on this.

I wondered if, when I loaded my new laptop from the Time Machine backup from my old laptop, there could have been some part(s) of Firefox that corrupted or did not copy properly. So, without doing anything to the Firefox that I had on the new laptop, I downloaded the Firefox installer again and installed a second copy of Firefox. I then opened that copy and went to the websites that had been giving me trouble. All of them worked. So I then exported all of my bookmarks to html from the first version and imported them into the second version. I now seem to have a fully functioning Firefox browser.

Same settings, same OS, same version of FirefoxâI don't understand why the problem exists. Only real difference is that it is a newer MacBook. I do not normally subscribe to conspiracy thinking, but, as much as I love Apple products, the company has been guilty of bad behavior in the past: is it possible they have made a change which affects how Firefox runs, in order to try to drive people to use Safari?

I had already called the number provided by wehelp 106 and had followed his instructions to give him remote access to my computer.

When he said to leave the screen just as it was and to wait for 15 or 20 minutes for him to call me back, I checked my gmail on my old laptop and found your messages. I immediately closed whatever I could and then shut down the new laptop. Right after that he called me to ask what happened. I told him that I had received multiple warnings about him. He hung up. </p><p>In hindsight, I feel very stupid. Normally I am very keen to potential spam and such like. For some reason, I felt that his reply indicated some sort of Mozilla endorsement, which, again in hindsight, was foolish on my part.

Page titles, web addresses and tags from your bookmarks. Pages you currently have open in other tabs (see below under Switch to tab). Sync'ed tabs from other devices. Note: If you click on the address bar (instead of typing into it), a drop-down of your Top Sites will be displayed. Icons will indicate whether a matching result is an open tab or a bookmark. When you see the page you want, just click on it or use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight it and then press Enter. </p><p>Firefox will also suggest popular search suggestions from the default search engine. See Search suggestions in Firefox for more information. </p><p>The address bar suggestions adjust based on your browsing behavior, such as how frequently and recently you visited a web page and what result you chose based on what was typed. This way pages you visit all the time will show up at the top of the list, often after typing only one character. </p><p>URL autocomplete In addition to the autocomplete drop-down list for pages you've been to before, Firefox will also complete the URL in the address bar. For example, if you type ""aw"", Firefox may fill in ""<a href=""http://esomefoundation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">esomefoundation.org/</a>"" to complete the address ""<a href=""http://awesomefoundation.org"" rel=""nofollow"">awesomefoundation.org</a>"" if you've visited that site before. Pressing Enter in this case would take you directly to that address. </p><p>URLAutocomplete75 Switch to tab The address bar also searches through your open tabs, displaying results with a tab icon and the text ""Switch to tab"". Selecting these results will switch you to the already open tab instead of creating a duplicate. </p><p>SwitchToTab75 To turn off the ""Switch to tab"" option temporarily, press the ALT key while clicking on the page in the autocomplete list that appears below your address bar. This will open your page in a new tab instead of switching to an existing one. Search the Web Beyond searching your history, bookmarks or tags, you can also search the Web right from the address bar. </p><p>To learn more, see Search with the Firefox address bar. </p><p>Change search settings You can change the way Web search works in the address bar. </p><p>Visit Change your default search settings in Firefox to learn more. </p><p>What can I do to get the best results? When you want to go to a web page you've visited before, type a few letters from its web address or page title. Scroll through the autocomplete entries and find the page in the list (type in another letter if you don't see it listed). Press Enter to go to the selected web address. Firefox will give this entry/result combination higher weight in the future. Do not clear the browsing history - usually the richest source of autocomplete entries is from the title/web address combination. Clearing browsing history will remove these entries from the results. Bookmark and tag frequently used pages. The address bar will match on the name you give the bookmark and also tags associated with the bookmark. See the Bookmarks in Firefox article for more information on how to use bookmarks in Firefox. You can improve your autocomplete results by tagging pages with easily-typed tag names. </p> id:1320483,created:2020-06-06 02:51:15 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 02:51:15 -0800,creator:himanshupro0003,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello dj razor,  <strong>With these steps you got your older address bar</strong> The following configuration changes to get the old address bar back: </p><p>Load about:config in the browser's address bar.

This can occur when web font downloads are blocked, or when Firefox is set to disregard page style rules and use a standard set of fonts. Here are some steps to investigate: </p><p>Here are a couple things to check, the details follow: </p><p>(1) Font setting -- are pages allowed to specify fonts to use? (2) Is a setting or add-on blocking downloadable fonts? </p><p>For #1, go to the Options page: </p> <ul><li>     Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li>     Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li>     Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li>     Any system: type or paste about:preferences into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it  </li></ul> <p>In the search box at the top of the page, scroll down to the ""Fonts &amp; Colors"" section and click the ""Advanced"" button. </p><p>Then make sure the box is checked for ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above"" </p><p>Any difference (you would need to reload the problem page, Ctrl+r or the circling arrow button, to see any difference)? </p><p>For #2, some add-ons have a feature to globally block downloadable fonts unless you specially allow them. Do you run uBlock Origin or NoScript, for example? In uBlock Origin, the setting is called ""Block remote fonts"". </p><p>There's also a general setting to block downloadable fonts in about:config, if you think you might ever have changed that: </p><p>(1) In a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful or accepting the risk. </p><p>(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste gfx.down and pause while the list is filtered </p><p>(3) If the gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled preference is bolded and ""modified"" or ""user set"" to false, double-click it to restore the default value of true </p><p>Was it any of those things? </p> id:1320502,created:2020-06-06 03:34:47 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 03:34:47 -0800,creator:mbox.shashank,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi settleman, </p><p>If the bug you wish to report affects Mozilla, Firefox, Thunderbird, Camino, or Seamonkey, you need to go to <a href=""http://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>. </p><p>Hope it Helps.

If the site doesn't work in another browser, check out The problem happens in all web browsers. The problem only happens with certain websites If you see any of these error messages, it might just be a problem with Firefox's cache: </p><p>The connection was interrupted The connection was reset The connection has timed out Try clearing Firefox's cookies and cache Do these steps and then reload the website you're having trouble with. </p><p>Click the Library button 57 library icon on your toolbar.

Below the drop-down menu, select both Cookies and Cache. Make sure other items you want to keep are not selected. Click Clear Now. If clearing Firefox's cookies and cache didn't work, it's probably a sign that there is a problem with the website itself. In that case you'll just have to wait for it to get fixed.

See Firefox and other browsers can't load websites for some troubleshooting suggestions. </p><p>Other, less common problems A website reports that Firefox is outdated, incompatible or not supported - See Websites say that Firefox is outdated or incompatible even though it's the latest version. A plugin has crashed - This means that a plugin which is being used to display content on the current page has unexpectedly quit. See Send plugin crash reports to help Mozilla improve Firefox for more information. Malicious website errors - If you see a ""Suspected Attack Site!"" or ""Suspected Web Forgery!"" warning, Firefox has blocked access to the website you're visiting to protect you from malware or web forgery (phishing). For more information, see Phishing and Malware Protection (<a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a>). Offline mode - If you see a message about offline mode, you may have set Firefox not to use your network connection. Make sure your computer has a network connection and then: Click the menu button New Fx Menu , click Developer and make sure Work Offline is unchecked. The page isn't redirecting properly - This problem can be caused by problems with cookies. See Websites say cookies are blocked - Unblock them for more information. If you get a File not found error, try the troubleshooting steps in these articles: Troubleshoot extensions, themes and hardware acceleration issues to solve common Firefox problems Troubleshoot Firefox issues caused by malware Content Encoding Error - If you get the error message Content Encoding Error or The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression, use these steps to diagnose and fix them: Check the settings of any Internet security applications you use (including firewalls, anti-virus or anti-spyware programs, and privacy protection programs). You should try to remove any permissions those applications have for Firefox, and then add them again. For program-specific instructions for a number of applications, see Configure firewalls so that Firefox can access the Internet. Follow the Standard troubleshooting steps. This address is restricted - This error occurs when you are attempting to connect to a web server on a port that is reserved for another application. If the website you are trying to visit contains a colon followed by a number in its address (for example, <a href=""http://website.com:23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://website.com:23</a>), try removing that portion (<a href=""http://website.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://website.com</a>) or replacing it withÂ :80 (<a href=""http://website.com:80"" rel=""nofollow"">http://website.com:80</a>). If this doesn't work, you may have been given an incorrect address. DNS cache is invalid - DNS is the service that converts a website's domain name into the IP address that Firefox uses to connect to a website. This information is saved to your computer's DNS cache in order to improve speeds. However, if the DNS cache record is corrupt or the website has changed IP address, Firefox may be directed to the incorrect server. The Firefox and other browsers can't load websites article explains how to flush the DNS cache. For additional information, see </p>"

It installed version 77. I have had some difficulty reinstalling 3 of my browser extensions, v. 77 doesn't seem to want them and I need to go through the install routine several times. It's difficult to turn the extensions on and off, too. </p><p>But that's not why I'm here. I'm here because after refreshing Firefox yesterday, yes, a Firefox tab crashed this morning. </p><p>I'm just about done spending any time troubleshooting Firefox.

If you click the Advanced button on a ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"" error page and you see the error code SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER or MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_MITM_DETECTED, it means that the provided certificate was issued by a certificate authority that is not known by Firefox and therefore cannot be trusted by default.  </p><p><strong>The error occurs on multiple secure sites</strong> </p><p>In case you get this problem on multiple unrelated HTTPS-sites, it indicates that something on your system or network is intercepting your connection and injecting certificates in a way that is not trusted by Firefox. The most common causes are security software scanning encrypted connections or malware listening in, replacing legitimate website certificates with their own. In particular, the error code MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_MITM_DETECTED indicates that Firefox is able to detect that the connection is intercepted.  <strong> </strong> Antivirus products<strong> </strong> </p><p>Third-party antivirus software can interfere with Firefox's secure connections. You could try reinstalling it, which might trigger the software into placing its certificates into the Firefox trust store again. </p><p>Here are some alternative solutions you can try:  </p><p><strong>Avast/AVG</strong> </p><p>In Avast or AVG security products you can disable the interception of secure connections:  </p> <ul><li>  Open the dashboard of your Avast or AVG application. </li><li> Go to Menu and click on Settings &gt; Protection &gt; Core Shields. </li><li>  Scroll down to the Configure shield settings section and click on Web Shield. </li><li>  Uncheck the box next to Enable HTTPS Scanning and confirm this by clicking OK. </li></ul> <pre>In older versions of the product you'll find the corresponding option when you go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Components and click Customize next to Web Shield </pre> <p>See the Avast support article Managing HTTPS scanning in Web Shield in Avast Antivirus for details. More Information about this feature is available on this Avast Blog.  </p><p><strong>Bitdefender:</strong> </p><p>In Bitdefender security products you can disable the interception of secure connections:  </p><pre>   *Open the dashboard of your Bitdefender application.    *Go to Protection and in the Online Threat Prevention section click on Settings.    *Toggle off the Encrypted Web Scan setting. </pre> <pre>   In older versions of the product you can find the corresponding option labelled Scan SSL when you go to Modules &gt; Web Protection </pre> <p>In Bitdefender Antivirus Free it's not possible to control this setting. You can try to repair or remove the program instead when you're having problems accessing secure websites. </p><p><br> <strong>Monitoring/filtering in corporate networks</strong> </p><p>Some traffic monitoring/filtering products used in corporate environments might intercept encrypted connections by replacing a website's certificate with their own, at the same time possibly triggering errors on secure HTTPS-sites. </p><p>If you suspect this might be the case, please contact your IT department to ensure the correct configuration of Firefox to enable it working properly in such an environment, as the necessary certificate might have to be placed in the Firefox trust store first. More information for IT departments on how to go about this can be found in the Mozilla Wiki page CA:AddRootToFirefox.  </p><p>For corporate Bitdefender products, please refer to this Bitdefender Support Center page.  </p><p><strong>Malware</strong> </p><p>Some forms of malware intercepting encrypted web traffic can cause this error message - refer to the article Troubleshoot Firefox issues caused by malware on how to deal with malware problems.  </p><p><strong>Missing intermediate certificate</strong> </p><p>On a site with a missing intermediate certificate you will see the following error description after you click on Advanced on the error page: </p> <ul><li><ul><li>he certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown. </li></ul> </li><li>The server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates. </li><li>An additional root certificate may need to be imported.  </li></ul> <p>&lt;/h4&gt;Bypassing the warning&lt;/h4&gt; </p><p><em>Warning: You should never add a certificate exception for a legitimate major website or sites where financial transactions take place â in this case an invalid certificate can be an indication that your connection is compromised by a third party.</em> </p><p><br> If the website allows it, you can bypass the warning in order to visit the site, even thought its certificate is not being trusted by default:  </p><pre>   *On the warning page, click Advanced.    *Click Accept the Risk and Continue </pre> <p><br> </p><pre>I hope to resolve your problem then reply to me . </pre> <p><br> </p><p>Thank you. </p>"

This was one of many FF problems that I deal with constantly.  In addition to this problem, I work on multiple computers and android FF, so syncing has been a part of life since it was introduced and done a good job of keeping me under the FF umbrella. </p><p>Because of the increasing amount of time spent browsing using mobile devices, ff android also became a key need and ff was necessary there because of FF sync.  In addition to this issue, FF Android has several serious issues that I have posted and sent feedback on over the past several years that have never been addressed... one example is a post I made on the FF Android section here that has received zero response compared to the dozen posts here. </p><p>The FF team has recently made significant improvements behind the scenes especially in the area of browser security, however, from a user's viewpoint, I have seen very little response to specific needs and problems such as this one in the user interface arena.  Security is top of the list for me, but, when the interface demands time and effort during every use of the platform, it's time to look at alternatives. </p><p>After reviewing the current browser picture, I decided to revisit Chrome (which I had not used other than single pages that didn't render well in FF for a number of years)  I removed everything that I had setup in Chrome such as bookmarks, history, etc, and accepted Chrome's offer to import from FireFox... and was impressed at how easy it was.  (Among other things I was finally able to capture the passwords that FF had recently locked down despite many users needs beyond viewing only one password at a time) </p><p>That was yesterday afternoon and I was initially switching back and forth between the two browsers on multiple devices and learning and tweaking Chrome's configuration.  As expected, there were a number of ""wants"" such as uBlock Origin not being available on Chrome Mobile and a host of minor irritants that can be challenging such as learning new keystrokes (at my age) but, by this morning, I took the plunge and changed my default browser from FF to Chrome. </p><p>I have been surprised with the relief that came from not having to battle the multiple FF points as I have been doing for years, and the demands of the switch and learning the new UI have been minimal by comparison. </p><p>My hope in posting this dissertation that it might somehow be seen by a Moz decision maker and result in even a slightly shifting priorities in the users direction. </p><p>Again, thanks for all the information and help, Beverly Howard </p> id:1320231,created:2020-06-05 12:36:03 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 12:36:03 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>BevHoward <a href=""#answer-1320147"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> &gt;&gt; reset your customizations &lt;&lt;  Ouch...

This often happens when I cut or paste... I've actually gotten used to this... I have to then navigate back to where I was when those actions were taken. </p><p>I've also seen posts where others (including myself) will highlight something on the screen in an incoming message (such as the now common ""verification codes"") then press &lt;ctrl-C&gt; to copy the code, then toggle to the login screen and paste only to have the previous contents of the clipboard pasted into the field.  That's become so common in GMail that I have learned to &lt;rt-click&gt; and select ""Copy"" instead. </p><p>More clues... I hope.

I started looking for the location of the default css for the browser in the hopes that it would answer this question. However, the answers on the net are anything but accurate and (I think) apply to some older versions of the browser. Is there a specific css file (or files) that contain the default css settings for FireFox, and if so, where is it/are they located? </p><p>I am in the process of converting some older web pages of mine from using font tags to using css instead.

The question had nothing to do with forms, however. It is about the actual size of the FONT size attributes as compared to the H1-H6 header tags. The second answer was more helpful, but still not what I was looking for. I actually did find an answer by searching the web. I found three sites that each had part of the data I was looking for, and I was able to build a table of the results. From that I was able to see that looking at it from the standpoint of 'em's is the way to determine this. I also found that Firefox's numbers are different from the old FONT size and H1-H6 when using CSS to set the size. It's not always much of a difference, but enough to make the page look different. I am using this table as my guide in converting all of my old pages to HTML5/CSS compliance. I would post it in this message, but it is a html document and I don't know how it would display. It also uses the FONT tag for setting the size of the text for comparison to the H1-H6 tags, so I don't know how well that would go over here. </p> id:1320039,created:2020-06-05 07:55:36 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 07:55:36 -0800,creator:anamika02jnv,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>hii wayne </p><p><br> you visit this site for default css settings for FireFox. </p><p>Examine and edit CSS - Firefox Developer Tools | MDN I hope it helps. </p> id:1320036,created:2020-06-05 07:53:06 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 07:53:06 -0800,creator:nfdakash461,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>TheÂ :default CSS pseudo-class selects form elements that are the default in a group of related elements. </p><p>What this selector matches is defined in HTML Standard Â§4.16.3 Pseudo-classes â it may match the &lt;button&gt;, &lt;input type=""checkbox""&gt;, &lt;input type=""radio""&gt;, and &lt;option&gt; elements: </p><p>A default option element is the first one with the selected attribute, or the first enabled option in DOM order. multiple &lt;select&gt;s can have more than one selected option, so all will matchÂ :default. &lt;input type=""checkbox""&gt; and &lt;input type=""radio""&gt; match if they have the checked attribute. &lt;button&gt; matches if it is a &lt;form&gt;âs default submission button: the first &lt;button&gt; in DOM order that belongs to the form.

I've also seen a plugin to ""fix content types"" that shows up on this site, but it didn't change anything.

Very small files (few hundred bytes) are stored entirely in the MFT and can thus always be recovered. Only when clusters that the deleted file occupies are reused to store other data then it isn't possible to recover a deleted file. On FAT32 (and FAT16) file systems this was more difficult, especially when a file is fragmented because on these file systems the bits that represent the cluster chain were cleared, so you had to be lucky that you could reconstruct the cluster chain. On NTFS is such a reconstruction not needed as you would only need to scan MFT. You would have to use a wipe utility on Windows to ensure that files with sensitive data are really gone and also do such a wipe if you would sell the computer.  <a href=""http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtml</a> </p><p><br> thank you </p> id:1319901,created:2020-06-05 04:54:10 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 04:54:10 -0800,creator:pallavikeshri499,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>hello, </p><p>It slows down any other processes which are working with the HDD to a near-standstill whenever it happens, so I have recently started navigating ...

Whenever I open this directory in Windows Explorer, the hard drive goes absolutely nuts and sounds like it's having a heart attack.  Resource Monitor shows that it's due to a roughly 11.5 MB/sec access to the drive's NTFS Master File Table (see below screenshot): </p><p>Indexing has been disabled for this directory, and all its subdirectories, as it is known that drive indexing and large numbers of small files are a volatile combination. Likewise, the directory only contains a couple folders (each of which house a large number of files), so none of the files in question are ever being displayed onscreen.  As such, I am a bit baffled as to why this intense reading occurs. It slows down any other processes which are working with the HDD to a near-standstill whenever it happens, so I have recently started navigating the drive and its contents via Command Prompt/PowerShell, which, for whatever reason, does not seem to trigger the NTFS reading-frenzy. I'm not really a tech person, and so I don't know the details of how Windows 7 accesses drives to display files and folders, so I have a couple questions:  Why is the NTFS Master File Table being accessed, even though none of the files in question ever appear on screen, and none of them are ever being opened? Is it absolutely necessary? If not, is there a way to disable it? If so, what negative consequences would result? Is there a more efficient (in terms of reducing disk wear and unnecessary file table access) way to set up a directory whose sole purpose is to house a large number of files? Additional info: The drive is healthy (no S.M.A.R.T errors, and CrystalDiskInfo says there have been no problems), and is not a boot drive. </p>"

It is made available for free as an open source project, and is contributed to and maintained by OWASP. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a vendor-neutral, non-profit group of volunteers dedicated to making web applications more secure. The OWASP ZAP tool can be used during web application development by web developers or by experienced security experts during penetration tests to assess web applications for vulnerabilities. </p><p>OWASP ZAP Overview The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy is a Java-based tool that comes with an intuitive graphical interface, allowing web application security testers to perform fuzzing, scripting, spidering, and proxying in order to attack web apps. Being a Java tool means that it can be made to run on most operating systems that support Java. ZAP can be found by default within the Kali Linux Penetration Testing Operating System, or it can be download from here and run on OSs that have Java installed. The OWASP ZAP proxy borrows heavily in GUI appearance from the Paros Proxy Lightweight Web Application security testing tool. Kindly see this article for a detailed look at the Paros Proxy tool. </p><p>Launching the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy OWASP ZAP is found by default within the latest Kali Linux 2.0 Penetration Testing Linux distribution. It can be launched by navigating to the âApplicationsâ menu and selecting the âWeb Application Assessmentâ option. A list will appear showing the different tools used for web app security testing. Here we click on the OWASP ZAP tool and wait for it to launch.

Otherwise, continue with the next step.</em> </p><p>(3) On the bar with the preference name, keep the radio button next to Boolean and click the + button to add the preference. Then Firefox should display the new value.  </p><p>(4) If the new preference was not set to true automatically, double-click it to toggle the value to true. </p><p>Screenshot sequence attached for reference. </p><p><img src=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2020-07-05-08-41-48-53626c.png""> </p><p>To summarize the expected result: </p><p>(1) New tab (no customization) </p> <ul><li> browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick =&gt; true </li><li> middle-click opens links in a new tab </li></ul> <p>(2) No effect (partial customization) -- on Windows and Mac </p> <ul><li> browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick =&gt; <strong>false</strong>, [middlemouse.openNewWindow =&gt; false] </li><li> middle-click on a link is ignored </li></ul> <p>(3) New window (full customization) </p> <ul><li> browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick =&gt; <strong>false</strong>, middlemouse.openNewWindow =&gt; <strong>true</strong> </li><li> middle-click opens links in a new window </li></ul> id:1330065,created:2020-07-05 07:09:05 -0800,updated:2020-07-05 07:09:05 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Maybe you have an extension that prevents opening a new tab or your software is blocking it. </p><p>Start Firefox in <u>Safe Mode</u> to check if one of the extensions (""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Extensions) or if <u>hardware acceleration</u> is causing the problem. </p> <ul><li>switch to the DEFAULT theme: ""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Themes </li><li>do NOT click the ""Refresh Firefox"" button on the Safe Mode start window </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems</a> </li></ul> <p>Boot the computer in Windows Safe Mode with network support (press F8 on the boot screen or hold down the Shift key) to see if that has effect. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/</a> </li><li><a href=""https://www.7tutorials.com/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.7tutorials.com/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10</a> </li></ul> id:1330054,created:2020-07-05 05:42:43 -0800,updated:2020-07-05 05:43:51 -0800,creator:pete39,updated_by:pete39,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have exactly the same problem.

You sometimes might need to click this checkbox to clear it and check it again on the Options page: </p><p><br> </p><p>By default, other links open in the same tab.

I don't care, because every time I update, one of the extensions I use every day is disabled without my permission.  How do I get firefox to shut up about it once and for all?  In other words, where is the ""do not check for updates"" command hidden, or, how else can I shut this thing up?  I have, in the past, liked firefox, but it has, over the last few years, supported less and less of features I use daily, at a minimum, many times/day for most. </p><p>So how do I shut these annoying alerts about an update I have NO intention of installing off?  ""You can't"" is not a valid answer.  Nor is ""just upgrade and lose half of the stuff (again) that you use all the time.""  Sorry if I sound angry, but these constant annoyances (and Thunderbird is doing the same---so same question for it here) are really getting on my nerves. </p><p>I have Firefox almost working the way it should.  Still can't click in a bookmark toolbar bookmark and then click on ""add bookmark here"" like I could.  That was one of those I used about 10--30 times per day, depending on what I was working on. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox-680;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1319747;1319751;1319769;1319771;1319888;1319890;1319919;1320158;1320164;1320224;1320307;1320451;1320524;1320572;1320651;1320983;1320986;,jim174,"id:1320986,created:2020-06-06 15:25:38 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 15:25:38 -0800,creator:jim174,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Cool ... that means I can stop watching it, too. </p> id:1320983,created:2020-06-06 15:08:44 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 15:08:44 -0800,creator:the-edmeister,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p><strong>jim174</strong> </p><p>If the <em><strong>Alternative Solution</strong></em> that I brought to your attention did truly answer your original question, please use the ""button"" for <strong>Solves the problem</strong> which is to the right of <em><strong>Does this reply solve the problem?</strong></em> to the lower right corner of my posting so that other users who search this forum to try to solve their same problem can be helped thru this thread, as I helped you. </p><p>And I can stop watching this thread ....  <em>I keep getting it in my ""needs attention"" listing with my Mod log in</em>. </p> id:1320651,created:2020-06-06 07:13:41 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 07:13:41 -0800,creator:jim174,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I have my extensions update automatically---they don't break things when they update, like Firefox and Thunderbird do.

Oh, and some updates, once done, don't let you go back to a previous version, so if the update fscks things up for you, you can't even go backwards to the previous version that worked (that would also need to be in that list of everything that the update would break).  But they don't do that.  So I stay with the version that works for me.   </p><p>Or, in this case, almost works.  I'm still waiting for the ability to create a bookmark in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar directly (used to be called, ""add bookmark here"" and was an extension) to come back.   That was great---have a bunch of tabs of gamedev stuff that I want to bookmark in my gamedev bookmarks toolbar folder (or a folder under that one, or a folder under a folder under that one, etc.)?

The process did however identify some aspects of the fault that may be useful to you. </p><p>Firstly, any activity that involves ""selecting a folder"" causes a ""Firefox not responding"" error. For example trying to change the downloads folder in 'Firefox Options' instigates the fault. Also ""Open File"" from the pull down ""File"" menu instigates the fault (this I think may be particularly significant as this action is not actually trying to download or save any file, one is just trying to select a folder). This, of course, also effects any activity using ""Save As"" or ""Save To"" as well as ""Save Page As"". </p><p>Downloads, for example, work fine if you just ""Save"" to the previously configured download folder, but does not work if the Options configuration is set to ""Always ask where to save"". </p><p>Specifically from the trouble shooting tutorial: </p><p>1) Deleting ""pluginreg.dat"" file made no difference. 2) Deleting ""mineTypes.rdf"" file made no difference. 3) Clearing ALL Firefox 'History / Cache / Temp files etc etc"" made no difference. My Firefox is configured to automatically delete all this clutter on exit anyway. 4) No ""browser.download.*******"" entries in about:config were marked ""user set"". Note: only one of the the entries listed in the tutorial was present, ""browser.download.useDownloadDir"" and this was set to default. 5) Entry ""browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone"" was not present, it wasn't listed in about:config. 6) No additional third party ""Download Managers"" are installed. 7) Also, temporarily disabling my anti-virus protection made no difference. </p><p>As per your suggestion I installed the ""Save Image"" add-on, again any action that involved selecting a folder instigated the fault. In the extension configuration page, I had to resort to manually typing in the save folder, using the folder browse button instigated the fault. I also noted that the radio buttons for selecting predefined folders were greyed out and unselectable. This extension did save ALL images on a page, but I could not find a way of selecting a specific image in isolation, Also any use of ""Save As"" or ""Save To"" initiated the fault. </p><p>With regard to 'plugins &amp; extensions', the first thing I did before posting my original post was to disable ALL plugins &amp; extensions, and also initiate the latest version check function. Again, updating and disabling made no difference. </p><p>In conclusion. it seems that it is the ""selection of a folder"" activity that is the root cause of the problem, not a 'save' issue in itself. </p><p>Note: All other programs on my PC, including Internet Explorer work as expected without issue. At least for as many as I have currently checked. </p><p><br> EDIT 1: Since posting this reply I have done some more checking of my other applications, in the main, all the ""Save As and Open"" functions work as expected. I have however found one non Firefox application issue. </p><p>In Internet Explorer, ""Save As"" and ""Open File"" operate correctly, but if you're on a web page that includes a ""Browse for File to Upload"" button. Say for example you want to use an on-line service to convert a PDF file on your HDD to Word etc. Then clicking on the within web page ""Browse"" button opens the search folders dialogue window that immediately freezes and crashes Internet Explorer the same as it does in Firefox. In all other respects, Internet Explorer (I'm using version 11) seems to be functioning without error. </p><p>EDIT 2: Since I described the Internet Explorer issue in EDIT 1 above, It was clear that the issue affected two browsers rather than just Firefox in isolation. I knew that Firefox wasn't faulty on March 15th (refer to original post), so I thought I would use Windows 'System Restore' to put my PC back to an earlier known good working state. The nearest date available in System Restore database to March 15th was March 17th. At the end of the System restore process I got a message that System Restore had been unable to complete successfully due to a missing file and that no changes had been made. </p><p>I checked the Firefox version and saw that it was still the later version 28 (as expected if System restore hadn't been successful), but also found that the ""save image"" and ""open file"" error had gone away and Firefox was working normally. For how long is another matter. I will be monitoring the situation closely and try a couple of PC re-boots. I have in the past had the situation where System Restore has fixed a problem only to have it re-appear after a re-boot. If the fix doesn't hold I will update this post. If the fix does hold, then I will mark the issue as solved. </p><p>EDIT 3: After a couple of re-boots and a check on Windows Update to ensure all previous updates were still installed. Firefox fix seems to be holding OK. Also, a check in System Restore database confirms that running 'System Restore' did NOT revert PC back to an earlier time just as it reported. </p><p><br> i hope resolve your problem then reply me back. </p><p>Thank you! </p> id:1319757,created:2020-06-04 22:03:04 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 22:03:04 -0800,creator:Dibouski,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Anamika, Please see the reply &amp; image sent to Fred above, there are NO crash ID entries.

1289742,2020-06-04 16:08:03 -0800,2020-06-04T19:06:40Z,SharePoint - Drag and Drop,"<p>My office recently adopted SharePoint to replace our VM Ware servers for storing shared data.  My colleagues are able to drag and drop email attachments and files from FileExplorer into SharePoint, but I cannot.  Finally I realized they use Chrome, Edge, Explorer and other browsers and this functionality works fine.  It's only Firefox where it does not.

First I noticed ads that weren't there before, then it kept opening new windows about just downloading ABP and it won't keep my settings. Last week I wrote an email asking for help and didn't get a reply.  This ABP Plus is a MESS. </p><p>1. It won't keep my settings. </p><p>2. Right now I have no fewer than 5 ""Installation"" tabs in my browser. How do I make them STOP? It started after this last time that I updated your program. </p><p>3. Right now I don't even know if it's working right. How can I go back to the last version that didn't foul up? </p><p>Today, I went to Firefox website and was going to download to plain old Adblock but that page said it was not monitored. see attachment. So I went to the Mozilla website. see attachment. When I clicked on ""Recommended extensions may also be found while browsing with FF...."" it took me to a page that didn't have anything about AdBlock. Over an hour later, I ended up right back where I started from.  I'm exhausted and I give up trying to follow links that take me back again and trying to describe how it's taking me round in circles. How do I go back to the old AdBlock? It worked well for me, didn't make me reset every time I open my browser and actually blocked ads. Firefox, Windows 8.1 latest versions. Please reply in simple English I am a senior and techy words just make my head swim.  If someone replies and I don't reply back, it may be that I can't get on the internet, the wifi here is lousy at best and most of the time, not at all. I try to get on the internet several times a day, if someone replies I will reply as soon as I can. Don't give up on me.

I think most browsers work that way in recent years. Some people have said that sites were using a lock icon as their site icon to fool users into thinking they were secure. Maybe it was that or something else which led to the change. </p> id:1319548,created:2020-06-04 15:08:26 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 15:08:26 -0800,creator:armanmailbox1,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Hello  thalaharate, </p><p><strong>Follow the instructionsÂ :</strong> </p><p>There's no ""cache"" for Favicons. They are saved directly in the places.sqlite file, in your Profile folder, with your bookmarks and browser history. There are a few hidden prefs that deal with Favicons, but those prefs are for the display or not of Favicons in the UI - they shouldn't affect the saving of Favicons in the bookmarks file. It is possible that your places.sqlite file is partially corrupt and is causing that problem, but the ""fix"" involves deleting that file with Firefox closed, so that when you start Firefox a new places.sqlite file will be created. The downside is that all your browsing history will be gone, and all your saved Favicons will also be gone. The bookmark backup file that is used to restore your bookmarks after deleting that file doesn't backup the Favicons. </p><p>From what I have seen with the bookmarks I have saved over the years, like maybe 50% of the websites out there even have Favicons and some websites don't follow the established standards for Favicons. The Favicon may appear in the URL bar and on a Tab, but Firefox won't save it because the Favicon image is the wrong format or it's hidden in a remote file and Firefox can't save it when the bookmark is used for the first time. </p><p>Also, if you are in the Private Browsing mode, Firefox won't save the Favicon. <a href=""http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing</a> </p><p><br> I hope resolve your problem then reply me back.  </p><p>Thank you </p>"

Every time I open Nightly, I go to options, and check to see the default search engine. It's always Bing. So I delete Bing, and change it to Google. Well, when I close the browser, I have a nice surprise waiting for me. Bing.  I've spent almost all day scanning my computer with different anti-virus/malware programs, deleted several viruses (hopefully there aren't any more), and it still happens. I've started Nightly in safe mode with all of the add-ons off, and it still happens. Went to about:config, prefs.js, user.js, and searched for invalidprefs.js (and so on), and nothing worked.  One thing I've noticed, is after having refreshed Nightly (I don't want to go through the whole changing my settings and customization thing again, so no screenshots), the list of browsers had Bing twice. One on top (the one that comes with the browser), and one on bottom (the one that keeps getting added). For this reason, I think it could be malware, or some unwanted program that I, for the life of me, cannot find in file explorer or control panel.

Clearing the icon cache does nothing to prevent this from happening in the future. </p><p>It is not difficult to restore the taskbar icon.  The blank page icon must be deleted, and then I must navigate to the location of the Mozilla Firefox folder under Program Files (x86).  There I can find the firefox.exe file and pin a new shortcut to the taskbar.  Everything will then work fine until the next Firefox update. </p><p>Is there something about the update process that recreates the firefox.exe file making it break the pinned taskbar icon?

1289665,2020-06-04 07:15:25 -0800,2020-06-04T22:57:51Z,Open the payload of a HTTP error,"<p>I'm a software developer working on backend services, always juggling between Firefox and Chrome (because none of them fully satisfy my needs). What I need from them is to behave the way it will be most practical for me, which isn't necessarily aligned with the majority of users. </p><p>My current problem is this. I work with APIs which in my daily work often return various HTTP errors. These errors also contain a payload which describes the problem in detail. I want to be able to see this payload easily in the browser. Yes, I can use other tools like Postman for this (which I do), but for simple GET requests without special request headers it would be much more practical to just use a browser. </p><p>Currently, when my API opens an error (for example a 400 Bad Request), Firefox decides to just silently go back into the previous page (undos the URL change). If I open the Network tab in the Web Developer view, I can however see the failing response with all of its details. Still, this is too impractical for me. </p><p>BTW, the response contains a custom Content-Type which isn't recognized by Firefox by default. But Firefox isn't downloading the payload as a file (like it would usually do for a successful page load of an unknown Content-Type), it just silently doesn't do anything. I've installed an extension to handle my custom Content-Types (called ""Open in Browser""), but since Firefox isn't attempting to open this one, I can't use it in this case. </p><p>So, how can I force Firefox to stay on that URL and show the response payload in the window? If not in vanilla Firefox, any plugins?

There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server. HTTP messages are composed of textual information encoded in ASCII, and span over multiple lines. In HTTP/1.1, and earlier versions of the protocol, these messages were openly sent across the connection. In HTTP/2, the once human-readable message is now divided up into HTTP frames, providing optimization and performance improvements. Web developers, or weboligarchs, rarely craft these textual HTTP messages themselves: software, a Web browser, proxy, or Web server, perform this action. They provide HTTP messages through config files (for proxies or servers), APIs (for browsers), or other interfaces. </p><pre><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/firefox</a> </pre> id:1319253,created:2020-06-04 08:26:52 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 08:26:52 -0800,creator:rtanglao,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi marko.vodanovic </p><p>This forum is focused on Firefox user problems not developer issues. </p><p>Please ask your web dev question  </p><p>1. stack overflow and tag it firefox <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/firefox</a> </p><p>or </p><p>2. discourse firefox dev tools forum </p><p><a href=""https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/devtools/213"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/devtools/213</a> </p><p>Cheers! </p><p>...Roland </p>"

Hi Barry, unknown extensions can creep in when you install other software, so while the symptoms have abated for now, you may want to dig into that a little more deeply when time permits:  (1) Open the Windows Control Panel, Uninstall a Program. After the list loads, click the ""Installed on"" column heading to group the infections, I mean, additions, by date. This can help in smoking out undisclosed bundle items that snuck in with some software you agreed to install. Be suspicious of everything you do not recognize/remember, as malware often uses important or innocent sounding names to discourage you from removing it. Take out as much trash as possible here. If you're not sure, feel free to post program names or a screenshot of the list. (2) Open Firefox's Add-ons page using either:  Ctrl+Shift+a (Mac: Command+Shift+a)  ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Add-ons  type or paste about:addons in the address bar and press Enter/Return  In the left column of the Add-ons page, click Extensions.  Then cast a critical eye over the list on the right side. Any extensions Firefox installs for built-in features are hidden from this page, so everything listed here is your choice (and your responsibility) to manage. Anything suspicious or that you just do not remember installing or why? If in doubt, disable (or remove).  Any improvement?  (3) You can search for remaining issues with the scanning/cleaning tools listed in this support article: Troubleshoot Firefox issues caused by malware. These on-demand scanners are free and take considerable time to run. If they finish quickly and especially if they require payment, you may have a serious infection. I suggest the specialized forums listed in the article in that case. Hopefully that will flush anything on your system and in your Firefox that could rear its ugly head, er, popup... </p> id:1319198,created:2020-06-04 07:10:58 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 07:10:58 -0800,creator:nancypham_,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Nevermind.

Secure Connection Failed A Secure Connection Failed error page will include a description of the error, an option to report the error to Mozilla and a Try Againbutton. There is no option to add a security exception to bypass this type of error.  The error page will also include the following information:  The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.

Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue Certain secure connection failures will result in a Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue error page.  </p><p>Website issues TLS version unsupported Some websites try using outdated (no longer secure) Transport Layer Security (TLS) mechanisms in an attempt to secure your connection. Firefox protects you by preventing navigation to such sites if there is a problem in securely establishing a connection. Contact the owners of the website and ask them to update their TLS version to a version that is still current and still secure.  The following change has been reverted for an undetermined amount of time, to better enable access to critical government sites sharing COVID19 information: Starting in Firefox version 74, the minimum TLS version allowed by default is TLS 1.2. Websites that don't support TLS version 1.2 or higher will display a Secure Connection Failed error page with Error code: SSL_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION and a message that This website might not support the TLS 1.2 protocol, which is the minimum version supported by Firefox. The error page may also include a button, Enable TLS 1.0 and 1.1that will allow you to override the minimum TLS requirement; however, Mozilla plans to remove this option and permanently disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in a future version of Firefox. For more information, see this Mozilla page. </p>"

Search for these two configurations, and set them to false.  browser.tabs.remote.autostart = false browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2 = false You need to double-click to quickly toggle between true and false. 2] Check your Add-ons Start Firefox in Safe Mode and see if the problem disappears. If it does, then you may need to check your Firefox add-ons and extensions. Maybe one of them is causing the crashes. </p><p>3] Downgrade Firefox Version It is possible that the current version has a problem. You can choose to downgrade. Go to the directory of other versions and languages, and choose an older version which worked for you. Post that, make sure to disable automatic Firefox updates.  </p><p>Click the menu button and choose Preferences. In the General panel, go to the Firefox Updates section. Choose the radio button which says âCheck for updates but let you choose to install them.â This will make sure that until you are sure the new update will not have the same issue, it will not update Firefox. This can only be a temporary measure since one must always use the latest versions with all the security and performance updates. 4] Send Crash Reports Type about: crashes. It will list of crash reports.

The new version of the Firefox web browser is a bug fix release that addresses two issues found in previous versions of the web browser. Firefox 76.0.1 is a minor release. Mozilla plans to release it on May 8, 2020 to the public. The release is not yet available officially. Once it is available, users may download the new version from the official Mozilla website or use the built-in updating feature of the Firefox web browser to get the update installed automatically on the device it is run on. Firefox 76.0.1 addresses two bugs. The new version of Firefox is released just days after the release of Firefox 76.0 Stable; this happens usually when major issues, e.g. security issues, crashes, or compatibility issues, are discovered. Firefox 76.0.1 fixes a crash that occurs in earlier versions on 32-bit Windows devices if certain nVidia drivers are installed on the device. The bug report reveals that the issue accounted for about 7% of all tab crashes since the release of Firefox 76.0. </p><p>Firefox was created by Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross as an experimental branch of the Mozilla browser, first released as Firefox 1.0 on November 9, 2004. Starting with version 5.0, a rapid release cycle was put into effect, resulting in a new major version release every six weeks. This was gradually accelerated further in late 2019, so that new major releases occur on four-week cycles starting in 2020.[3] Firefox 77 is the latest version, which was released on June 2, 2020 </p>"

Thanks everyone here for help, hope to resolve this issue somehow. </p> id:1319788,created:2020-06-04 23:24:16 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 23:24:16 -0800,creator:pallavikeshri499,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<ul><li> If a YouTube video, Facebook game, or other media isn't working, try the steps below to fix it. </li></ul> <p>These steps can help for: A video or game that won't load A video or game that's blank A gray box that shows instead of a video or game Chrome freezes or crashes while loading a video or game </p><p>Step 1: Update Chrome Videos and games sometimes need the latest version of Chrome. </p><p>1.On your Android phone or tablet, open the Play Store app . <a href=""http://2.At"" rel=""nofollow"">2.At</a> the top left, tap Menu   My apps &amp; games. 3.Under ""Updates,"" look for Chrome . 4.If Chrome is listed, tap Update. <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyx9zhg-rpAhUNbn0KHVXOCK0QFjAJegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fchrome%2Fanswer%2F6138475%3Fco%3DGENIE.Platform%253DAndroid%26hl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw377-LSdemEdklLi4Jkd5HO"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyx9zhg-rpAhUNbn0KHVXOCK0QFjAJegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fchrome%2Fanswer%2F6138475%3Fco%3DGENIE.Platform%253DAndroid%26hl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw377-LSdemEdklLi4Jkd5HO</a> 5.When the update is done, go back to the site with the video or game.

This has happened numerous times and I am trying to figure out if there is something I am doing to cause it. I am on a Mac PowerBook Pro. I can have several Firefox windows open and something I do by moving my ""mouse"" (the trackpad) from right to left deletes all open windows and resets to my home page, essentially like I have just opened the app. Firefox doesn't quit or anything, it just wipes out all open windows which is very annoying. As it is a trackpad and I am moving my finger across, I am wondering if my thumb is doing something inadvertantly. Is there a ""movement"" or something that is causing this?

Also, the exceptions do not make any difference. Just wondering though, how do i turn off this automatic ""private browsing""??

EV certificates can be used in the same manner as any other X.509 certificates, including securing web communications with HTTPS and signing software and documents.

Of the ten most popular websites online, none use EV certificates and the trend is away from their usage.[citation needed] </p><p>For software, the verified legal identity is displayed to the user by the operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows) before proceeding with the installation. </p><p>Extended Validation certificates are stored in a file format specified by and typically use the same encryption as organization-validated certificates and domain-validated certificates, so they are compatible with most server and User Agent software. </p><p>The criteria for issuing EV certificates are defined by the Guidelines for Extended Validation[1] promulgated by the CA/Browser Forum, a voluntary organization whose members include leading CAs and vendors of Internet software as well as representatives from the legal and audit professions.[2] </p><p>To issue an extended validation certificate, a CA requires verification of the requesting entity's identity and its operational status with its control over domain name and hosting server. </p>"

However, I want to use the headset mic I have plugged in. </p><p>I'm on Windows 10, with a Logitech C920 HD Pro webcam, and using the on-board audio on a MSI MPG Z390M Gaming Edge AC motherboard. </p><p>I know there's nothing wrong with the on-board audio or headset, because I can select and use this mic in Discord and other apps just fine. </p><p>Also, if I unplug the webcam, then Firefox will offer to use the on-board mic, but of course, now I have no video. </p><p>In both cases, it never offers to use the audio line-in, which I've wanted to use to present to a meeting the output from of another device. I've tried installing Voicemeeter, hoping that would solve all my issues, but Voicemeeter's virtual microphone also never shows up in the ""Microphone to share:"" dropdown. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318750;1318752;1318753;1318756;1319540;1320300;,dan125,"id:1320300,created:2020-06-05 15:59:28 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 15:59:28 -0800,creator:dan125,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Aha! I figured it out! </p><p>So first of all, Chrome uses whatever device you selected in the Windows 10 Settings Sound Input device dropdown. That made intuitive sense, and is probably what I'd suggest Firefox do as well. </p><p>But what I think Firefox is doing is asking Windows for its ""Default Communication Device"", which is a concept that is independent of the selected sound input device. Unfortunately, the Windows 10 Settings Sound dialog does not mention the notion of a ""Communication Device"" at all, so it is very confusing that this concept exists. I suspect it is a historical distinction, as I finally found it in the old Control Panel UI, under ""Sound"", on the ""Recording"" tab. This tab lists all input devices, and you can right click any of them and select ""Set as Default Communication Device"". If you then restart Firefox, this device will be the one device that Firefox allows you to choose. </p><p>My suggestion would be to switch to what Chrome does, as it makes more sense to the user. Also, you don't even need the drop-down box if you aren't actually going to provide a choice. </p><p>Alternatively, you could do what Discord does, and just list all the devices, in which case the drop-down box would make a lot more sense. </p> id:1319540,created:2020-06-04 15:01:55 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 15:01:55 -0800,creator:feer56,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>That is a scam phone number.

The console log looks like this: </p><p>ERROR Error: ""Uncaught (in promise): S: {""headers"":{""normalizedNames"":{},""lazyUpdate"":null,""headers"":{}},""status"":504,""statusText"":""Gateway Timeout"",""url"":""https://myurl.myurl/profil"",""ok"":false,""name"":""HttpErrorResponse"",""message"":""Http failure response for https://myurl.myurl/profile: 504 Gateway Timeout"",""error"":null}"" </p><p><br> Replaying request: Very useful feature, however it seems to have an issue with Authentication headers.

Inside of this submenu are options to ""Close Tabs to the Right"" and ""Close Other Tabs"". </p><p>This change was made for the following reasons: </p><pre>   As feature are added and context menus grow, we would like to keep the size of the menu short enough to be read quickly. One of the ways we can do this is to group similar commands. By grouping the commands that close multiple tabs together, we can shorten the height of the context menu by one menuitem. It should be noted that we also do not want to remove context menuitems just for the sake of it because some context menuitems are the only accessible non-keyboard-shortcut way for keyboard-only users to access such functionality as Pin Tab, Mute Tab, Duplicate Tab, etc.    Some users have reported that they accidentally clicked the ""Close Tabs to the Right"" and the ""Close Other Tabs"". While a user has the ability to restore their tabs through the ""Undo Closed Tabs"" menuitem, some data may have been lost as well as potential increased network usage if we are unable to restore the pages from the Firefox cache. We decided that adding a little ""speed bump"" before a large destructive action could benefit users. We prefer this over a modal dialog that requires users to move their mouse across the screen and thus requires more time.    The ""Close Multiple Tabs"" submenu provides us an area to add some extra features that users have asked for over the years such as a ""Close Tabs to the Left"" option. </pre> id:1323569,created:2020-06-13 06:15:54 -0800,updated:2020-06-13 06:15:54 -0800,creator:gershonido,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>MichaÅ KopeÄ has created an addon which (re)adds the option to delete all tabs to the right to the main context menu: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-tabs-right/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-tabs-right/</a> </p> id:1319928,created:2020-06-05 05:22:05 -0800,updated:2020-06-05 05:22:05 -0800,creator:pallavikeshri499,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>The value was already 'false'.

This is a pair of custom style rules that you could apply to Firefox's tab context menu using a userChrome.css file. </p><p>Are you already familiar with userChrome.css from making other tweaks to Firefox's toolbar area? If you aren't, when you have 10 minutes to focus on it, here's how it works: </p><p>This assumes you do not already have a userChrome.css file. If you do already have a working userChrome.css file, you just need to add the rule under (1) to your file. </p><p><br> <strong>1.

Inside Firefox, type or paste about:profiles in the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it.  Click the Create a New Profile button, then click Next. Assign a name like Sept2016, ignore the option to relocate the profile folder, and click the Finish button.  After creating the profile, scroll down to it and click the Set as default profile button below that profile, then scroll back up and click the Restart normally button.  Firefox should exit and then start up using the new profile, which will just look brand new.  Do right-click context menus work any better in the new profile?  When you are done with the experiment, open the about:profiles page again, click the Set as default profile button for your normal profile, then click the Restart normally button to get back to it. </p>"

Doing business online these days IS doing business, and the trusted means by which to measure our results is Google Analytics. Note 1: Both are using the same JavaScript code to gather data, itâs only that Tag Manager makes it easier to customize the code with additional tags. Note 2: We are only going to touch on Tag Manager issues in this post. Tag Manager has a lot of elements that we could get into but would be too extensive for this post. Tag Manager Errors deserve a post all to themselves so maybe Iâll hit that one for you guys next time. A Custom Campaign is a means of uncovering how referred traffic arrives to your site. Using this data you can understand more about the most effective ways to attract visitors to your content. By using the Google URL Builder Tool and the Mobile URL Builder Tool (for mobile applications) you can add âParametersâ (little extensions) to your campaign URLs that lets Analytics identify where your visitor came from. Example: Youâre running an advert campaign on Facebook. To track visitors specific to this campaign you would do the following: Go to the URL Builder Tool Add your unique URL Add âsourceâ âmediumâ and ânameâ (These are required) Add additional parameters âcontentâ and âtermâ if you wish to further identify the campaign. Hit âSubmitâ youâll then receive your custom campaign URL to use in your Facebook Advert. </p> id:1319764,created:2020-06-04 22:30:16 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 22:30:16 -0800,creator:trevorbainbridge,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Your answer seems not to be relevant to the problem. </p> id:1319138,created:2020-06-04 04:25:34 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 04:25:34 -0800,creator:pallavikeshri499,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Hello trevorbainbridge,  </p><p>To stop Firefox opens multiple tabs uncontrollably in Mozilla Firefox, follow ...

I have a second device but for reasons not explained to me I have been logged out of the firefox sync service and I do not have current login details. In my opinion, you are exposing users too easily to the loss of sensitive data. In logins I had, for example, data to log into the account of a financial institution, now it will take me at least a week to recover this data. Well, this will be a lesson for me in the future and I will not be fooled a second time I will not trust free open source software with low quality services.

For testing, I've uploaded a folder that contain multiple MP4's to my Google Drive.  I then Share this drive with my other email.  I then want to download the content of these multiple files to a hard drive folder.  Doing this to test how Download works for Google drive. </p><p>I open my received email and see the Shared invite.  I log into my Google account and select the first file to download (using RT click and Download into a selected directory).  A Save-As folder box opens. Everything works with the file downloading ultimately as a *.mp4 file.  When I go back to the Google drive and attempt to down load a second file, I get the following pop up message... </p><pre>  - You are Not signed in  - You are signed out.  <em>Sign back in</em>, the click 'Retry'....there is a Retry box. </pre> <p>The Sign back in (in the msg) does not work, nor does the Retry box! All that happens is the box refreshes. </p><p>What I end up doing is to close the Google My drive TAB, and re-select the invite email message.  This opens a new tab again that points to my shared folder.  I then select my 2nd file,  and download..everything works.  Now when I try a 3rd file, I end up getting  the same Msg again and need to close the Tab and reload from the email the Google drive. </p><p>I have turned off any AD blocker on the Google drive.  It's almost something is in a cookie or cache.  I don't want to constantly have to reset any of these every time.  Tried once, and made no difference.  Any Idea, maybe something in the FF Settings? </p><p>What I want is to be able to repeatedly pick and download files from Google to my selected folder without having to re-select the email invite. I also notice, that on the second try, I don't get asked for my Google ID/Pass like I did the first time.  It's like I was sent to a third party site (Save-as pop up box) and cannot come back to the folder listing.  It would be nice if the Save-As location could be reused from the previous Save with a check box. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318504;,anuhea55,"id:1318504,created:2020-06-02 15:38:57 -0800,updated:2020-06-02 22:07:47 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Please ignore spam replies about third-party support you may have received earlier and do not call a supplied phone number or send email.<br>This is the official support forum and we do not supply support by phone. </p> <hr> <p>Are you using any extension that deals with cookiesÂ ? </p><p>You can try these steps in case of issues with web pages: </p><p>You can reload web page(s) and bypass the cache to refresh possibly outdated or corrupted files. </p> <ul><li>hold down the Shift key and left-click the Reload button </li><li>press ""Ctrl + F5"" or press ""Ctrl + Shift + R"" (Windows,Linux) </li><li>press ""Command + Shift + R"" (Mac) </li></ul> <p>Clear the Cache and remove the Cookies for websites that cause problems via the ""3-bar"" Firefox menu button (Options/Preferences). </p><p>""Remove the Cookies"" for websites that cause problems: </p> <ul><li>Options/Preferences -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security<br>Cookies and Site Data: ""Manage Data"" </li></ul> <p>""Clear the Cache"": </p> <ul><li>Options/Preferences -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security<br>Cookies and Site Data -&gt; Clear Data -&gt; Cached Web Content: Clear </li></ul> <p>Start Firefox in <u>Safe Mode</u> to check if one of the extensions (""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Extensions) or if <u>hardware acceleration</u> is causing the problem. </p> <ul><li>switch to the DEFAULT theme: ""3-bar"" menu button or Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Themes </li><li>do NOT click the ""Refresh Firefox"" button on the Safe Mode start window </li></ul> <ul><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode</a> </li><li><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems</a> </li></ul>"

Is there any possible way to say 'I never want to see this megabar again in my life'?  Or a way to tell the devs that it should NOT be a default option on new updates?

The PDF file displays OK as a preview within Firefox. However, the PDF itself contains links, and it is these links that don't work. The PDF links work OK (with suitable security warnings) when I view the PDF in the built-in viewers in Chrome or IE11 (although not Edge). </p><p>I've just used the Options page to change the way Firefox handles PDFs from ""Open in Firefox"" to ""Use Windows default application"". Now when I click on the link <em>to </em>the PDF in the web page, the PDF opens in Adobe Reader externally to Firefox, and the links <em>within </em>the PDF work OK. So there is a work-around. However, it would be nice if the default PDF viewer in Firefox enabled link functionality within the PDF itself. So I guess my question is whether I'm missing some option setting that would do this?

1289332,2020-06-02 07:13:18 -0800,2020-06-04T06:32:25Z,Downloading and Opening docx Firefox appends doc onto file,"<p>I am using Hotdocs portal, which is an in-house document assembly tool.  Firefox is the recommended browser, but it is recently handling 2016 docx files incorrectly.  When we choose a file on the portal site (internal site), we go through the interview and are presented with a link to ""download"" the assembled file.  When you click that link, a pop-up appears showing the file name as abc.docx but then says it is a Word 97 - 2003 document, even though it is not. The original template is not.

I am frequently unable to click a link on a web page until I refresh the page 2. Problems completing online forms. For example I just tried to make a payment transfer in Paypal but was unable to type in the amount. When I logged in with Chrome instead, it worked fine. </p><p>Firefox has been my preferred browser for a very long time and I'd like to continue using it as my main browser, but unless I can eliminate these sorts of problems. </p><p>I wonder if anyone has experienced similar problems and if they have found a solution to them? </p><p>Many thanks Jennie </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1318245;1318445;1318470;1318486;,jennied,"id:1318486,created:2020-06-02 14:45:17 -0800,updated:2020-06-02 14:45:17 -0800,creator:jennied,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>With regard to the Joomla issues, I have raised this with Joomla developers on occasions and they haven't been able to duplicate the issues in Firefox.

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las Ãºltimas actualizaciones de Firefox, Ã©sto ha cambiado. Tengo la versiÃ³n 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquÃ­ he llegado. Tengo instalados ademÃ¡s, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montÃ³n de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. SÃ­ que lo veo Ã¡gil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veÃ¡is lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la pÃ¡gina no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayorÃ­a de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas pÃ¡ginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son pÃ¡ginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya cÃ³digo malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesiÃ³n abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histÃ³rico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. TonterÃ­a dirÃ­a yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versiÃ³n prehistÃ³rica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menÃº que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el mÃ³vil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situaciÃ³n cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente serÃ¡ Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;1319551;1319559;,ji.perez.marturet,"id:1319559,created:2020-06-04 15:27:52 -0800,updated:2020-06-04 15:27:52 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hi ji.perez.marturet, I'm sorry, some service company is spamming our forum.

It may have been just my two profiles getting their new instructions. </p><p>If I run Firefox with ""Profile 2"" and then run a second instance of Firefox with ""Profile 1,"" I get two instances of Firefox, as expected. Launching URLs uses ""Profile 2,"" the first instance that I launched (perhaps, the first instance's ""I'm the default"" setting prevails?). Similarly, launching ""Profile 1"" and then ""Profile 2"" results in ""Profile 1"" being preferred for external URL requests. If I close the instance of Firefox that I started first, my next external request for a URL results in the Profile Manager coming up and asking which profile I want to use. If I select the still-running profile, the URL opens in a new tab in the currently running Firefox instance. </p><p>In conclusion, it is a minor annoyance to have to be prompted for my ""Profile 1"" Firefox profile instead of having it as the default. The larger issue appears to me to be that, whatever change was made to how profiles are handled for multiple installations, there is an unintended consequence for regular profile handling introduced in Firefox 67.0. I would like to get to the bottom of it and change the behaviour back (or have a setting to regulate the behaviour). </p> id:1318263,created:2020-06-02 09:16:22 -0800,updated:2020-06-02 10:07:19 -0800,creator:webhelp2,updated_by:,is_spam:true,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you for sharing the details.

Soy Fran, y estoy encantado de poder ayudarte! He leÃ­do tu consulta y te comento, con 200mb de RAM es muy muy complicado de que funcione el navegador bien, ya que un navegador de internet consume recursos que tu computadora no estÃ¡ preparada para asumir.  Igualmente, te voy a pedir que accedas al administrador de procesos (con los pasos que te indicarÃ© ahora) para ver el uso de tu memoria. Necesito que me mandes tantas capturas como procesos haya, hasta que todos se cubran.  Para acceder al administrador de procesos hay varios procesos, los cuÃ¡les te detallo aquÃ­:  <strong>MÃ©todo 1: Abrir el Administrador de Tareas Ctrl + Mayus (shift) + Esc </strong> </p><p>La manera mÃ¡s directa de abrir el Administrador de Tareas es mediante el uso de un atajo de teclado. En este caso, haremos uso del siguiente enlace: Ctrl + Mayus (shift) + Esc. Esto harÃ¡ que de manera automÃ¡tica y directa se abra la ventana de la herramienta Administrador de Tareas. </p><p><br>  MÃ©todo 2: Abrir el Administrador de Tareas desde la pantalla azul. </p><p>Haz uso del atajo de teclado: Ctrl + Alt + Supr/Delete, Esto harÃ¡ que se abra una pantalla azul con varias opciones, entre las cuales se encuentra: Administrador de Tareas, en la que tendrÃ¡s que hacer clic. Esto harÃ¡ que se abra la ventana de dicho administrador desde el que podrÃ¡s realizar las operaciones necesarias.<strong> </strong> </p><p><strong>MÃ©todo 3: Abrir el Administrador de Tareas desde la barra de tareas </strong> </p><p>Con el ratÃ³n y la barra de tareas podrÃ¡s acceder al administrador de tareas con tan solo hacer clic con el botÃ³n derecho de nuestro ratÃ³n sobre la barra de tareas. Esto harÃ¡ que se muestra un menÃº con varias opciones, entre ellas encontrarÃ¡s la opciÃ³n Administrador de Tareas en la que deberÃ¡s hacer clic izquierdo para provocar la apertura de la herramienta del Administrador de Tareas. </p><p>MÃ©todo 4: Abrir el Administrador de Tareas desde la herramienta ejecutar.  </p><p>Puedes acceder al Administrador de Tareas haciendo uso de la herramienta Ejecutar. Para ello solo tienes que hacer uso del atajo de teclado: Tecla de Windows + R. Cuando la herramienta Ejecutar se ha abierto deberÃ¡s introducir el siguiente comando: taskmgr </p><p>Una vez introducido pulsa la tecla Enter para comprobar como de manera automÃ¡tica la ventana de la herramienta del Administrador de tareas se abre en el escritorio de tu ordenador. </p><p>MÃ©todo 5: Abrir el Administrador de Tareas desde el menÃº de opciones avanzadas.(Windows 8.1 y 10) </p><p>Si haces clic  con el botÃ³n derecho de tu ratÃ³n, sobre el icono del menÃº inicio de la barra de tareas en Windows 10 se mostrarÃ¡ un menÃº en el que entre otras opciones encontrarÃ¡s la opciÃ³n Administrador de Tareas, la cual deberÃ¡s seleccionar para que dicha herramienta se abra.<strong> </strong> </p><p>Tras seguir alguno de esos procesos, haz las capturas pertinentes con cualquier app de tu ordenador, o si no tienes app o no sabes hacerlo, debes de descargar alguna aplicaciÃ³n que sirva para hacer las capturas, por ejemplo LightShot o cualquier otra.  Espero las imÃ¡genes. Un saludo! </p>"
