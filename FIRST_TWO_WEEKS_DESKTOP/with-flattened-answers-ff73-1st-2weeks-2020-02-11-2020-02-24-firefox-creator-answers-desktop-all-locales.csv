I understand the desire to make startup faster for most users but it seems like this feature is being discouraged. </blockquote> <p>Yes  -   <strong>userChrome.css</strong> use is being discouraged due to it being hard to learn how use without creating too many support problems here. There was a discussion in Bugzilla before Firefox 57 Quantum was released about blocking userChrome.css altogether or even getting rid of the 3 main ""user files"", but that never came to fruition. But with the now monthly changes as XUL is slowly going away the userChrome.css scripts that people have been using may require attention with every new version that is released.  It is like a ""whack-a-mole"" game from month to month for some users who lack the ability to ""read the code"" and who may even have a rough idea about what each line of script may do or how it affects the user interface mods <em>(beyond me right now, as I lack the patience for dealing with it)</em>,  but for ""the average user"" its gobbledygook and that's where the problems arise. I have reverted back to one-at-a-time small changes or tweaks to the UI. </p><p>Hell, I have been around since Aug 2002 with the 3rd alpha version of Phoenix and have been using userChrome.css since Firebird 0.6 for small modifications and a few years later started using Stylish for more drastic modifications. I cut my use of userChrome.css a lot in recent years though, to spend more time actually using Firefox and far less time actually fixing what got broken way too often. I miss using it, and may return once the elimination of XUL code is completed. </p> id:1318935,created:2020-06-03 15:28:17 -0800,updated:2020-06-03 15:28:17 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>See also: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/what-is-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/what-is-userchrome-css.html</a> </li><li><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </li></ul> <p>In Firefox 69 and later you need to set this pref to true on the <b>about:config</b> page to enable userChrome.css and userContent.css in the chrome folder. </p> <ul><li>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true </li></ul> <p>See: </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-changes-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/firefox-changes-userchrome-css.html</a> </li></ul> id:1318917,created:2020-06-03 14:38:05 -0800,updated:2020-06-03 14:38:05 -0800,creator:themattman18,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Is userChrome being deprecated?

Using (CCleaner),"<p>Initially this may seem the simplest problem but Im not sure it is.  Perhaps due to order of closing session windows. I have this problem once every few years, So far I havent managed to set up anythng that works reliably to get me out of the mess. I use FF and have over 1000 tabs. 99% of the time 'restore session from before' after reboot works automatically great.  Obviously with that many tabs things slow down, I then use CCLEANER to clear up and reboot.Today I forgot I had mutliple unimportant firefox windows open in addition to my MOTHERLOAD firefox window. I closed my session in perhaps some haphazzard order. On restarting I only had my unimportant windows open.  I have not restarted after this Im still sitting in the new session. I have yet to find a consistent way to backup my open tabs. In the past I had an addon which wrote my tabs to a file but that addon got dumped after an update to FF. I REALLY REALLY dont want to lose my list of tabs as I wont be able to get this info back But more that this what is the safest way to back this info up on a regular basis in a way that I can get back to it? The current way is not 100% foolproof. :( </p><p>I have no history showing in FF as CCleaner removes all that (session data isnt removed). I assume I might have restore or previous restore files? Really not sure where to look. Im on Windows 10. Im not even sure where to look anymore for the sessonrestore file. Perhaps it doesnt save it when it isnt the last window to be closed??? Im reluctant to close this session now too. (Hope all my terminology is correct. Is it a window has mutiple tabs, you can have more than one window all of which comprise the session.) </p><p>Any help appreciated.

I can't get the e-mail to appear in the expanded middle pane. I switched to Chrome which is an alternate Browser that I use and I Did Not Have This Problem.

Algunas veces quedaron alfabéticamente y en otras sin ningún orden aparente, pero menos, en el orden en que yo tenía los videos y ello en mi caso es muy incómodo porque yo guardo muchos videos o marcadores en general, dentro de mis carpetas y en ciertos casos les quiero dar un cierto orden personalizado. </p><p>Por último, me parece que este problema se puede estar presentando por la función Sync de Firefox, la cual ya le he deshabilitado casi todas sus funciones, menos la de usuario y opciones.

For this reasons, it is not recommended to use Sync on computers you do not control. </p><p>At least, as Fred says, if you set a Master Password, the next person won't be able to affect your Firefox Account (i.e., if they decide to delete your bookmarks, that won't ripple back to your account and other installations of Firefox) or see your saved passwords. </p> id:1292458,created:2020-02-22 06:04:30 -0800,updated:2020-02-22 06:04:30 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>First, when you leave your computer, lock the keyboard. </p><p>As to Firefox: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-oligarch-password-protect-stored-logins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-oligarch-password-protect-stored-logins</a> Use a Master Password to protect stored logins and passwords </p><p>The password information is stored in two files in the profile folder.

When clicking the icon it bounces once and then disappears from the dock. Honestly, this started happening about August 2018, and in my troubleshooting decided to give the Developer edition a try, and for some reason that one worked so I stuck with it. </p><p>Shortly thereafter (a week or two) whenever I closed down the Mac, Firefox Dev wouldn't re-open. Deleting and reinstalling would work, but I'd have to re-set all my settings, re-activate the theme, etc., and all the browsing history would be lost. So, since then I would rarely shut it down.  </p><p>A few days ago I had to shut the Mac down completely, but this time Firefox Dev wouldn't open after re-installing. Oddly, I tried regular Firefox again as a solution, and it opened this time. I tested it out by shutting the Mac down completely, then restarting, and it retained all of the settings! I was really glad to once again be able to shut down my laptop at the end of the day without the headache of having to reinstall and re-set everything. </p><p>Then this morning, boom - back to the same nonsense, except now it won't open at all. Neither the regular FF or the Developer edition will work. I've done clean uninstalls to see if that was the problem, as in: removed them from the Applications folder, removed them from the Downloads folder, removed the /Firefox folder from user/Library/Application Support/, and emptying the Trash. </p><p>I saw in one Support post to delete the fbplugin file, 'as that had been causing Firefox to crash'. The closest I found to an 'fbplugin' file was a bundle-config.1 file, which contained 'fbplugin' throughout the file code numerous times. I renamed it temporarily, but didn't delete it. That didn't help the non-opening problem either.   </p><p>I also tried installing Firefox v 71, same result as the others. </p><p>Keep in mind after attempting all of these solutions of deleting, reinstalling, changing file names, etc., I did a complete shutdown and restart.  Also, I have not downloaded, updated, or changed anything since last week's phenomenon of regular Firefox beginning to work again.  So I'm completely stumped and would appreciate any help.  I'm currently running macOS Catalina 10.15.3.

I think that currently all (major) websites can be reached via IPv4. When you enable IPv6 in Firefox then Firefox will first try to connect via IPv6 and if that doesn't work (timeout) fallback to IPv4, so if a DNS lookup fails because a website only has a IPv6 address then you won't be able to access this website. There are some IPv6 test sites that can only be accessed via IPv6 and that is it for now. </p> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.test-ipv6.com/faq_avoids_ipv6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.test-ipv6.com/faq_avoids_ipv6.html</a> </li></ul>"

A Firefox Account allows you to use Firefox Sync. Your Firefox profile is simply the folder on your computer where your data (bookmarks, etc) is stored. </p><p>If you created a new Firefox profile, you won't see any of your past data (bookmarks, etc) because a new Firefox profile always starts out blank, with just some default stuff. </p><p>What is likely happening in your case is that you now have two Firefox profile folders on your computer (your original and the one that you created), but the new one that you created is now set as the default profile, meaning that Firefox automatically loads that profile each time. </p><p>This is usually an easy thing to fix.

That means that Firefox's downgrade protection is kicking in. </p><p>If you use a profile on a newer version of Firefox, it's locked to that version or higher. If you then try to update that profile with an older version of Firefox, it will not allow you to and will force you to make a new profile. </p><p>The reason it does this is in case something changes about how your data is stored. </p><p>For example, if Firefox 72 stored your bookmarks in a certain format and Firefox 73 stores in a new format. When updating from 72 to 73, Firefox can convert your old format to the new format. But it can't do the opposite from the new format to the old format. So trying to run that profile in an old version of Firefox could lead Firefox to think the data is corrupt and erase it to start over. </p><p>To fix this problem, you need to find out why your Firefox version keeps getting reverted back to a previous version. </p><p>I common issue, mostly on organization computers, is that the IT department has set a certain version of Firefox to install when you turn on the computer. But if they haven't disabled updates on Firefox, it will be updated while you use Firefox. Then, when you start the computer again, the updated version will be replaced with the version that the IT department has on their software management system. </p>"

I did as you suggested, loaded 68 esr, but sadly to no avail. I have spent the day going back much further until I got my logins/passwords and bookmarks to show. Believe it or not, the 'latest' version of FF that works totally is..... 57.0.4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The upshot of that was in a bit earlier version, I was able to save my logins to my computer to a cvs file. </p><p>Anything later than that password/logins do not show. On the more up to date versions my profile&gt;logins show that my passwords/logins are there (size of file). I have noted that the files of Key4 and cert9 did not update on my recent roll-back, but I assume that they are 'left-over' from my previous attempts to update to the newer version. Unfortunately even though I have now got a saved login/password file, I cannot 'import' as it will only give me a choice of Internet Explorer (which I have never even used) or nothing. </p><p>I have noticed that I have now got 3 profiles, but the default one is the only one that shows my logins and bookmarks? </p><p>I only use a laptop and a desktop.

However, the above method is typically quicker and simpler. </p><p>Once both logins and passwords are saved, you should have both accounts listed when you try to login on the specific website. However, Firefox may not automatically fill in the login details when you first open the page, since now there are multiple accounts for it to choose from and it doesn't know which one you want to select. But the two logins should be available in the drop-down list to select. </p><p>Currently, there's no way to label or colour-code logins, although this actually could be a very useful feature. The only want to tell the different accounts apart is by the login name, which would be different between the two. </p><p>The only other potentially useful alternative I can think of for your situation would be to make two Firefox profile folders: one for you and one for your wife.

This is to protect the profile from any issues caused by changes to the way that certain data is stored. </p><p>As a theoretical example, if the way that bookmarks are stored in version 73.0.1 was changed compared to version 73.0, then downgrading to 73.0 could mean that Firefox doesn't recognize the bookmark format and it might erase the bookmarks and start over in a format it understands. </p><p>Naturally, I've oversimplified it a bit and the above example is purely an extreme made up example, but that's the reason that downgrade protection exists. </p><p>However, you profile isn't ""erased"". What usually happens is that Firefox will detect that the profile isn't trying to load was run on a new version, so it will make a new blank profile for you and set it as the default. The profile and associated data is still on your computer though. </p><p>If you upgrade back to Firefox 73.0.1 you should be able to open the other profile that you were using. You may need to go to the <code>about:profiles</code> page in Firefox to set it as the new default and then restart Firefox. </p><p>There's really no logic reason to downgrade from 73.0.1 back to 73.0, since minor releases typically only include bug fixes. </p>"

In other words, with this feature, if a link is opened from a page in container X, but the link does not have a container associated with it, the tab would open in the default container rather than container X.  To give a concrete example:  My Google searches &amp; news are in a Google container.  When I click a search result, e.g., from a news organization that I don't visit enough to make a container for, I'd prefer it did not open in the Google container, but a different, generic one or No Container. </p><p>I realize there could be some odd side-effects if a site spans multiple domains or hosts if they're not all marked for one container, but as an optional feature I think it wouldn't bother people who don't want to deal with that possibility. </p><p>Another way to do something similar would be to allow users to mark a container as ""exclusive,"" meaning any link not in the sites assigned to that container would automatically go to No Container in the absence of an assignment.  These two options also be implemented and work together. </p><p>Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this or if there's already a way to do this that I just haven't found.

For example, a Gmail  alias for mymail@gmail.com could be mymail+firefox@gmail.com. </p><p>I would agree with possibility that a spammer was randomly generating email addresses if the email had been sent to my regular email address instead of an Gmail alias address.  Why would any spammer generate emails to Gmail alias addresses when they can just as easily send it to the root email address?  The recipient would receive the email regardless whether an alias was used or not.  If the spammer was sending emails to generated aliases, I would have received an email for each alias address he generated but I only received one email for the alias email address I use explicitly for Firefox.   That is how I know that company that sent the email got it from my Firefox account. </p><p>Still, I appreciate your effort to help resolve the issue.  It is only after we eliminate all other possibilities that we can figure out how this happened. </p><p>Thanks </p> id:1291561,created:2020-02-18 17:09:34 -0800,updated:2020-02-18 17:09:34 -0800,creator:rblariyap+ffx,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>jscher2000, Thanks for taking a look at this and suggesting a possible cause.  I do appreciate the effort you made. </p><p>As for the Alias, Gmail allows you to create an alias by adding a plus sign and any characters of your choosing to end of you email ID.  For example, a Gmail  alias for mymail@gmail.com could be mymail+firefox@gmail.com. </p><p>As for the malevolent extension theory, the few (5) extensions I have installed are pretty common (Facebook Container, uBlock, Evernote, etc.).  Besides, I would expect that the extensions are sandboxed so that they don't have access to your Firefox account information.  For example, would an extension have access to the passwords you store in your browser, if you use that feature of Firefox?  I would expect, by design,  that extensions would not have access to Firefox account information.  If the Firefox browser does allow that,  then I think that is a problem. </p><p>Thanks again. </p> id:1291548,created:2020-02-18 16:02:25 -0800,updated:2020-02-18 16:02:25 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><em>GeezerGeek <a href=""#question-1280189"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> </p> <blockquote> Today I received an email from Transit App sent to <strong>my Gmail alias email address</strong> that I only use for signing into my Firefox account. </blockquote> <p>Is that something like ""myfirefoxaccount@gmail.com"" that gets delivered to ""myactualusername@gmail.com"" ? </p><p>Do you have any unexpected devices on your account at <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/settings/clients"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/settings/clients</a> ? </p><p>Do you have any untrustworthy extensions on your Windows installation of Firefox (or any other installations)?

In fact, they are the same domain (<code>www.asna.ru</code>), just two different pages on that domain. </p><p>While Firefox does treat two separate subdomains (for example, <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>admin.example.com</code>) as two different websites, multiple pages on the same domain will share the same saved logins because they are the same website. </p><p>The reason for this is because some websites may allow users to login from any page on their website via a header or something of that nature. Tethering specific logins to specific pages of the same website would generally make for a bad experience when trying to log in. </p><p>That said, you could still be able to save multiple logins for the same website, they will just both be displayed on both login screens. The only exception for this would be if both logins are the same username but have two different passwords. In that case, Firefox will think that you have changed the password for a single account and it will ask you to update the saved password. </p><p>In that situation, a decent workaround would be to save your username with an additional character at the end. For example, <code>username</code> and <code>username2</code>. Then, both logins will be displayed for you to select and you will just need to remove the extra character once it's been filled into the login window. </p><p>You could add this new login by adding the extra character on the login window and attempting to log into the website. Naturally, you won't get logged in because the username is invalid, but it should prompt Firefox to ask you to save the password. Alternatively, you can <a href=""/en-US/kb/add-login-firefox-lockwise-desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">manually create a saved login and password using Firefox Lockwise</a>. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

I was able to click as fast as I could and it would close the tab. The exception of course being directly after selecting the tab. For example, you can't triple click an unselected tab (1 to select it and 2 to close it) to close it. There's a small waiting period after switching tabs where the double click feature will not close the tab.

The only way to get round it is in two steps as follows  a) set up 2-step verification for the email account on the gmail webmail page (sign in -&gt; click your name at top right, -&gt; ""Manage gmail account"" -&gt; then on the left ""Security"" -&gt; set up the two step verification which unfortunately requires your phone number. They will send a code in the form of G-123456 (i.e. six numbers). When entering the code in the field, leave off the G- part, just enter the numbers. b) When that is set up, you need to use their App Password function. You can give your app or program any name (Use ""Other"") if it's not in the dropdown list, such as ""TBird-My-email"". Click the Generate button and it shows you a small window with the Password code at the top right. Mark it and copy it then paste it in your Thunderbird -&gt; Security -&gt; Passwords -&gt; Show Passwords page to replace your previous password. (Maybe make a note of both the old and new passwords somewhere). This at least works with Mailwasher and Thunderbird. The problem I am currently facing is, I have two gmail accounts, both listed in Mailwasher and TBird. Using the so-called App Password on my PC I can download my main account's emails into Tbird with no problem, but when I select ""Get Mail"" for my second account in the list, I am immediately taken to some blasted ""One log in for all, set up your Google account now"" sort of page. I don't WANT to set up a one-for-all Google account....

If there was tabs you wanted to delete you could click on it with your mouse's right button.

Task Manager also only lists the processes, no applications. This process is very hard to kill, Task Manager can't end it, nor elevated rights Command Prompt TASKKILL with /FE, NirSoft NirCmd nor PSTools pskill64.exe nor Process Explorer. I have also tried ending all the other processes first I can think of, including explorer.exe, does not help.

For couple of weeks ago it updated with a new user interface and installed new components. To test that, I tried to uninstall Avira. Each component needs to be uninstalled separately using Windows Programs and Features: two components uninstalled cleanly, one component left an open minimized window that one couldn't pop open nor close. Antivirus and VPN do not uninstall: after you are asked do you want to uninstall and answer YES, nothing else visible happens. If you try to start another uninstall job, you get a window telling you can't start another as one program is already being uninstalled or changed. And waiting doesn't help. I have a support question about it in Avira forum. </p><p>Also last week, Flash Player installation failed with 89% done, tried twice and with same result. And the newest GeForce Graphics adapter drivers installation failed also. Both of those usually always install succesfully. </p><p>Microsoft System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW does not find problems, nor does Windows disc chechker tool. I also run: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab and Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Avira support recommends the Install and Uninstall troubleshooter to get rid of some old Avira rubbish. Also compared Windows folders rights to default rights listed in some web site: did not find differences with the couple of dozen folders I compared. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) according to Process Explorer is enabled looking at Firefox.exe process properties. I know command lines to change DEP settings and found it in System Performance Properties settings also, but have not touched it. </p><p>I've removed Firefox and Thunderbird parent.lock -files, with Firefoxilla both from profile folder C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME and temporary folder C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox before trying to start Firefox again.

Well, opened only the process in my case. </p><p>There are no previous session related saves (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js) in the profile folder any more, and the sessionstore-backups folder is empty. </p><p>I removed the Firefox installation, rebooted, and installed the 73.0 version 13.02.2020.

Firefox doesn't open application window in Windows safe mode either, also tried to run it as administrator option, and pressing SHIFT key, but neither helped. The newly created profile folder only has one file: times.json. </p><p>When installed Firefox again, it wasn't a clean installation: the Firefox folder was empty of files, but I did install into the same folder. Also did not edit register nor delete the profile folder. Which is what I'm gonna try next. However, Thunderbird does not use Firefox's profile, so why does it stop opening the application window same time with Firefox?

Koska itsellä Firefox ei toimi, en ole omalla koneellani, kun täällä foorumilla olen. Joten jos tähän viestiin automaattisesti jotain tietoja lisätään... tulee väärästä koneesta. </p><p>Vajaa viikko sitten Mozilla Firefox ja Thunderbird lakkasivat aukeamasta: vain prosessi - Firefox.exe tai Thunderbird.exe - käynnistyy (näkyvissä Tehtävien hallinnassa (Task Managerissa)) mutta sovellusikkuna ei aukea, eikä myöskään ole listattuna Task Managerin sovelluksissa. Prosessi on myös vaikeasti tapettava: sitä ei saa lopetettua Task Managerista eikä ohjelmilla jotka on tarkoitettu prosessien lopettamiseen: järjestelmänvalvojan oikeuksilla avatussa komentokehoitteessa TASKKILL PID /FE, NirSoft NirCmd ja PSTools pskill64.exe tai Process Explorer. Vaikka käynnistysongelma on molemmilla Mozillan ohjelmilla, olen koittanut ratkoa sitä lähinnä Firefoxin kanssa. </p><p>Ympäristö: Pöytäkone, Windows 7 PRO 64bit eng. kielinen, AMD:n Phenom II prossu, GeForce 1050Ti näyttis, ja kaksi järjestelmänvalvojan tason tunnusta on joilla olen hommaa ratkonut. </p><p>Virustorjuntana Avira Free Antivirus, joka voi olla jopa syntipukki. Siitä tuli nimittäin viikko-pari sitten uudella käyttöliittymällä oleva päivitys, jossa oli muitakin uusia komponentteja. Olen koittanut poistaa sen asennusta, mutta kaksi komponenttia siitä ei suostu Windowsin Programs and Features -asennuksen poistolla katoamaan: Antivirus ja VPN. Tukikysely siitä menossa Aviran foorumilla. </p><p>Viime viikolla epäonnistui myös Adobe Flash-player asennus (pysähtyi 89% kohtaan) sekä GeForce näytönohjaimen ajureiden päivitys uusimpaan versioon. </p><p>System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW ei löydä ongelmia, eikä Windows levynkorjaustyökalu. Kokeilin myös Microsoftin työkaluja: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab sekä Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Install ja Uninstall troublesooter -työkalulla koitin poistaa myös mahdollisesti wanhojen Aviran asennusten jäämiä (Aviran tuki suosittelee myös niin tekemään). Vertailin myös Windows kansioiden käyttäjäoikeuksia alkuperäisiin (Netistä löytyi sivu jolla niistä on listaus) enkä havainnut erilaisuuksia niissä muutamassa tusinassa jonka tarkistin. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) näkyi olevan Process Explorerin mukaan olevan päällä (Enabled) Firefox-prosessinkin ominaisuuksia katsoessa, en ole siihen itse kajonnut, löysin kyllä sen asetuksen Windowsin järjestelmän suorituskyvyn ominaisuuksista, ja komentokehoiteohjeet, jos nyt siitä kiikastaisi.   </p><p>Firefoxista ja Thunderbirdistä olen poistanut parent.lock -tiedostot, Firefoxilla sekä profiilikansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME sekä väliaikaistalletusten kansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox ennen kuin olen käynnistänyt selainta uudestaan, ja koska prosessia ei saa tapettua, se tarkoittaa siis että aina koneen uudelleenkäynnistymisen jälkeen. </p><p>Löysin neuvon avata Firefox klikkaamalla kuvaketta ja pitämällä SHIFT-näppäintä pohjassa, mutta sillä ei ollut eroa mun tapauksessani: vain prosessi käynnistyy. </p><p>Profiilista olen poistanut edellisen istunnon tiedostot (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js) ja sessionstore-backups kansio on tyhjä. </p><p>Poistin Firefoxin asennuksen, boottasin ja asensin uusimman 73.0 version 13.02.2020. Sama ongelma jatkui senkin kanssa. </p><p>Lisäsin kuvakkeeseen käynnistyspolun perään -P argumentin, ja Windowsin SAFE-modessa sillä sai käynnistymään ikkunan jossa voi luoda uuden profiilin ja valita mitä profiilia käytetään. Jos käynnisti Windowsin normaalisti, niin tuokaan ikkuna ei aukea. Firefox ei kyllä käynnistynyt Windowsin SAFE-modessakaan. Kokeilin myös Run as administrator ja SHIFT-napin kanssa, mutta ei käynnisty. Uuteen profiiliin tuli vain yksi ainoa tiedosto: times.json. </p><p>Kun asensin uuden version Firefoxista, se ei ollut aivan ""clean Install"", eli asensin saman nimiseen kansioon, joka kyllä oli tyhjä tiedostoista, enkä käynyt rekisteriä läpi, enkä poistanut edellistä profiilia. Mikä lieneekin seuraava yritys. Joku neuvoi myös place.sqlite -tiedostoa poistamaan/uudelleennimeämään, jota voin kanssa kokeilla. Tässä on nyt kuitenkin huomionarvoista se, että Firefoxin lisäksi Thunderbird alkoi samalla hetkellä käyttäytymään samalla tavalla. Ja sehän ei ilmeisesti mitenkään Firefoxin profiilia käytä, joten epäilen kyllä Aviraakin enemmän kuin että Firefoxin profiili olisi tähän kaikkeen syypää. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,fi,"",pelihemmo,""

It used to work fine for years until a certain point, but I cannot pinpoint when it went wrong and the possible whys.

But when moving it to the other monitor/ opening a new window on the other monitor it would not scale properly, but render according to the scaling factor of the other monitor. So, e.g. when moving from the internal to the external screen it would only render to the top left quarter of the screen, while the application was actually being the right size. At the same time the input mapping was according to the actual window dimensions, and not according to the visual rendering of Firefox. This would also happen the other way round, with Firefox then only rendering the top left part of the web page to the entire screen. </p><p>You can see this well on the attached screenshot, but notice that sway is a tiling window manager, so Firefox should actually be exactly the same size as the terminal next to it. Firefox also renders like this when the scaling factor was changed at run time, so the issue seems to me that Firefox on Wayland checks the scaling factor on startup just once globally and does not realize when it was changed or that it can be different on different monitors. </p>",firefox-740;beta;desktop;fix-problems;linux;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1300595;,freddy.wiehl,"id:1300595,created:2020-03-27 00:40:11 -0800,updated:2020-03-27 00:40:11 -0800,creator:freddy.wiehl,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Just as a general update, this this is not fixed in firefox up to 75.0b2.

Then I believe you would not run non-free non-trivial javascript on your computer and Facebook would then also not be able to track you. </p><p>This is probably only true if you are using an open free hardware and and open free operating system too. Otherwise the malware (non-free hidden) might track you anyway, of course. </p><p>For ""Companion for Reddit"" by OinkAndStuff it is is certified as 100% Free of malware by Softpedia Labs so this not working is a clear sign of malware obstructing it. </p><p>Come back to us and tell us if this solved your problem! </p>"

I only tested these 2 after I did the fixes so I don't have a high sample size to say if it mostly works or mostly doesn't.

I lost bookmarks and my search engine. I could also not use Options. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and all the usual tricks, but nothing worked. All I could do was use Windows 10 system restore to get FF 72 back. I even tried updating again, and the same thing happened. On my 2 laptops running  W10 I had no problem. I hope this problem can be fixed soon. In the meantime, I'm not updating FF until a new update is released, hopefully with a fix for this problem.   </p><p>NOTE: If you use the system restore trick to get back to 72.0.2, be sure to disconnect your Internet cable or wi-fi.

I think the larger vendors see the payment vehicle as a profit center, and so they try to cut it out.  Smaller vendors will take anything.

Let me count some of the ways...</strong></em> </p><p><strong>(1) If you are visiting the site in a private window</strong> </p><p>Cookies are not written to disk in private windows, so whether they are session cookies or have an expiration date after we're all gone, they will evaporate when the last private window is closed in your session. </p><p>The two ways a site could open in a private window are: </p><p>(a) Creating a private window in a regular session (for example, Command+Shift+p or right-click &gt; Open Link in New Private Window) </p><p>(b) Setting Firefox to use automatic private browsing on the Preferences page -- </p> <ul><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it </li></ul> <p>In the left column, click <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, then scroll down to the <strong>History</strong> section. Either of these will invoke automatic private browsing: </p> <ul><li> Firefox will: Never remember history </li><li> Firefox will: Use custom settings for history + ""Always use private browsing mode"" </li></ul> <p><strong>(2) If Firefox is set to store ONLY session cookies, and you have not made an exception for the site.</strong> </p><p>You can check for this on the Preferences page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, Cookies section. Make sure you do NOT have a checkmark for ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"". If you do, you need to create ""Allow"" exceptions for sites where you want Firefox to accept persistent cookies. </p><p><img src=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2019-05-01-08-10-39-73a6c7.png"" width=""500""> </p><p><strong>(3) If Firefox is set to Clear History When it Closes and that includes Cookies</strong> </p><p>Most people do not have this setting, but you can double-check here: On the Preferences page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, History section: make sure you do NOT have a checkmark for ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". If you want to use that feature with <em>some</em> types of data, use the Settings button to the right of it to confirm that Cookies are not being cleared. (Also, do not clear Site Preferences if you have made exceptions.) </p><p><strong>(4) If you use an add-on that modifies how cookies work</strong> </p><p>There are extensions to manage cookie lifetimes and removal, including some that expire cookies for inactive tabs. There also are extensions that isolate pages in a container, which creates a separate cookie jar for the pages in that container which are invisible to pages outside that container. </p><p><strong>(5) If you logged out of the site</strong> </p><p>The cookie identifies you to the site, but if your session ended, the site isn't going to start a new one automatically. So if you logged out on the site -- highly recommended for sites that have sensitive data or accounts you can't afford to have taken over -- then the site <em>might</em> pre-fill your user name on the login page, but you will need to sign in again. </p><p><strong>(6) If external utility or privacy software cleans browser cookies</strong> </p><p>If you use CCleaner, Advanced SystemCare or other third party programs that touch browser data, set them not to touch Firefox data. </p><p><strong>(7) If your IP address is unstable</strong> </p><p>Some sites link your identification to your IP address and require a new login if that changes. To minimize the potential for changes, you can check your Firefox connection settings on the Preferences page.  </p><p>In the search box at the top of the page, type <em>proxy</em> and Firefox should filter to the ""Settings"" button, which you can click. </p><p>The default of ""Use system proxy settings"" piggybacks on your system settings (for example, Windows/IE ""LAN"" setting). ""Auto-detect"" can lead to a flaky connection. You may want to try ""No proxy"". </p><p>Does any of that help? </p>"

But windows users continue to see changes to default app settings happen at every minor Windows update.  When they press the issue, MS goes strangely silent.

Firefox Sync <u><strong>is not a backup service</strong></u>. It was never designed to be a backup service and it doesn't function as a backup service. It's designed to make sure that your data (bookmarks, password, etc) are the same between multiple devices. It doesn't necessarily have a complete or permanent copy of your data on the server. </p><p>Furthermore, if you reset your Firefox Account password before logging into your computer after the Windows reset, the Firefox Sync data on the servers gets erased. The data is encrypted using the password for your account, so when it's changed that data becomes unusable. </p><p>If you used the <strong>Reset this PC</strong> option in Windows rather than resetting by reformatting the drive, you may be in luck. Windows will sometimes move your Firefox data to the <code>windows.old</code> folder in the root directory of your drive. </p><p>Sometimes, you can find the <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox profile folder</a> in the application data in that folder. </p><p>In the future, you should <a href=""/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">make a backup of your local profile folder</a> <u><strong>before</strong></u> resetting your computer so that your data can easily be restored. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p>"

Trouble is, the other two addys were sub accounts, one was a Business Account so much of the info was quite detailed but the same.   But these days, data breaches are so comon (yawn?) it's almost not shocking.  But 8 ?  Yikes.  Here's the thing, I thank you for the alerts, but you scare me to death then leave me hanging.  I have no idea which 5 sites had the same PW  (huh ?). I supposed over 20 years online and at 2500 logins, at some point my brain ran out of creative unique login's. I use a Password Program but it doesn't catch 3 email addresses that may share a common PW.   Any suggestions how to ""Resolve"" those breaches which I can barely remember where I've left my britches ?  Thanks.   5/2500  = .002 %  P.W.s repeated , not the worst odds in the world.

Was there some performance or functional reason for taking away the little arrow in the address bar for most visited sites???  So now what used to be a simple single click is now a minimum of a click and a keystroke.  And that's better?  It's a different sequence and takes an extra action, so it's double the effort to get the same behavior.  If you use this function a lot, which I do, those extra keystrokes add up very quickly and it's just very annoying because it used to function perfectly before.  So this is an improvement how???  Was it change just for the sake of change?  That was one of the features that brought me back to firefox from chrome.  Chrome didn't have (and still doesn't have) anything like it.  Had to use an extension to get that functionality.  So now I have to get an extension for firefox to make it do something that it used to do perfectly well before it was summarily removed???!!!

It also could occur if memory is so full that Firefox doesn't cache everything it is supposed to. </p><p>If we assume this is how the server wants it -- you could compare Microsoft Edge to see whether the same thing happens there -- the best workaround is to open listings in a new tab. For example, using one of these methods: </p> <ul><li> right-click &gt; Open Link in New Tab </li><li> middle-click the link with the mouse scroll wheel </li><li> hold down the Ctrl key when clicking the link </li></ul> <p>After you close the new tab, Firefox should switch back to the main list. </p><p>(2) Firefox may be restoring your location on the page too soon </p><p>Some pages contain images or embedded sections that load after the rest of the page content is displayed. Firefox may jump to the saved location but it's wrong because the embedded content hasn't loaded yet. </p><p>Usually, this leads to Firefox showing the bottom of the page, not the top, so I think #1 is more likely in your situation. </p>"

The dialog window still shows up with the ""open with / save file"" options, but before, once I picked ""save file"" it did remember the last choice and had ""save file"" choice set on concurrent downloads - now it does not, it defaults to ""open with"". Now, when I un-register the eg. rar extension in Windows, and Firefox does not know what to open it with, it will remember the ""save file"" choice. As soon as I register the file type ( rar, 7z, zip.... ) it starts defaulting to ""open with"". It becomes a pain and adds one more step to the file download to set ""save file""... It is also easy to just click ""open"" and instead of the download going to the desired directory, it opens it with the application it 'knows'. It is often far from the desired behavior, and it changed on 12FEB2020 when FF got updated to v73.

I am an old FF Windows user, but faced something new since moved to FF on Mac.  It does keep previous session when I try to troubleshoot - so I mean starting it, opening couple of tabs and trying to restart -  but unfortunately it does not if FF kept opened for days or weeks.  That's a pain, as lot of pinned tabs collected to the moment and I simply do not remember what was that weeks ago and it's not so easy to search throughout the history.  </p><p>Of course, Startup set to Restore previous session and History set to Remember.   I am aware there might be sessionstore.js or something like this, but might be there is some additional magic option to be set to avoid the issue?  I am aware of that ""last window to close - the only to remember"" problem. This is not the case.  </p><p>Just one window. Only pinned tabs. Clean window on start. No option to restore previous session (it's empty). </p><p>Appreciate any idea.  Thanks.  </p><p>P.S.

I don't know whether there is a general workaround for that other than making sure your main window is open when you choose Firefox &gt; Quit. </p><p>Second, you can check whether Firefox is still recording session history by looking at the timestamp on the <strong>recovery.jsonlz4</strong> file.

I can't complain about that -- at least, not until some problem pops up for me as a result of it -- but it is obscuring the control to allow Flash to run, and by the time I got the new drop-down cleared the control did not allow Flash to run and I had to reload the page. </p><p>However well-intentioned the developers are, I still maintain that they should -- until Flash officially deprecates at the end of the year -- allow a decision made by the user to allow Flash at a specific website to be saved by Firefox and eliminate the daily hassle of re-authorizing.  ESPECIALLY SINCE NOW THAT OTHER ENHANCEMENTS INTERFERE WITH THE FLASH ALLOWING DROP-DOWN. </p><p>This is my ongoing request, which will be made on every new release this year until the developers understand that they are making the experience of using Firefox less user-friendly.

I am trying to be rational about this while still expressing my deeply rooted opinion that the developers should have dealt with this incrementally instead of implementing the most user-intrusive method.  (I won't repeat myself, because I see you have acknowledged that in your replies ... I will simply thank you again for understanding.) </p><p>As to <strong>why</strong> I believe the developers should backtrack, <em>McCoy</em> is right about telling the sites to update, but realistically they aren't listening to us and probably will wait until the last minute.  There are only three sites left for me that are problematic, and those are where I have my daily sessions with Hidato, Sudoku, Jumble and my crossword puzzle.  All three are sites from reputable businesses like UClick but I imagine it is a colossal pain for them to retool those for HTML5 without losing the familiar interface for the users.  (And knowing that, I hope <em>cor-el</em> can understand that yes, I did indeed know that my decision to allow Flash does hold for a particular site until I close Firefox but that it is very unlikely I would need to revisit any of those a second time in a session.) </p><p>I am not leaning toward embracing the temporary downgrade idea (it's bad enough that I am still on Win 7 Pro, and I can only do that for three more years before Microsoft ends support for Security Essentials) nor do I want to keep track of a second version of Firefox. </p><p>I really think <em>McCoy</em> was on to something in the suggestion he made in the bug report, especially as an about:config option would be easily eliminated in the first release after Flash really has deprecated, but he is also correct that it isn't going to happen because as I said ... the developers have a ""we are gods"" complex and believe their decisions and actions can never be wrong.  (I will refrain from what I am thinking on a political level as I write that.) </p><p>Again, thanks for trying.

That means the passwords are still in Firefox, but the Firefox Lockwise system can't access them. </p><p>The most common cause of this is disabling the multiprocess feature (e10s) in Firefox. Some users went to extreme lengths to force Firefox to disable e10s, even though it's not recommended because it breaks core functionality in Firefox. Essentially, it prevents Firefox from opening the process it needs to access sensitive data, like your saved passwords. </p><p>I believe the most common working way that people disabled e10s was by adding the <code>MOZ_FORCE_DISABLE_E10S</code> environment variable to their system and giving it a value of <code>1</code>. If you've done that, you need to remove that variable and reboot your system. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p> <blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't forget to change the <code>signon.management.overrideURI</code> preference back to the default when you are done so that you get the Firefox Lockwise interface back.</blockquote>"

Traditionally, to increase the readability of text, Firefox has disabled background images when High Contrast Mode is enabled. With today’s release of Firefox 73, we introduce a “readability backplate” solution which places a block of background color between the text and background image. Now, websites in High Contrast Mode are more readable without disabling background images.""  This ""upgrade"" has made unreadable many webpages. I have - for years - used a high-contrast screen color set-up: black background with white letters. I used to be able to control the on-screen colors of visited and unvisited links. That control went away a few ""upgrades"" ago.   This most recent upgrade, make all e-Bay pages unreadable: there are huge white areas, which used to be black.   How do I undo this ""upgrade"", so that Firefox no longer wrecks my screen-color set-up.   Note: I will not - under any circumstances - address a problem created by an upgrade, by changing my computer's settings, e.g., by editing registry files, etc.   <em>jscher2000 <a href=""#answer-1289822"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></em> <blockquote> Hi Jay, support forum volunteers do not decide what features are turned on and off.

Já bych řekl, že to píšu srozumitelně, ale nedostávám odpověď na podstatný problém a to, že po aktualizaci = automatické aktualizaci FF na ver 73 došlo ke zničení profilu a smazání dat. Nepomohlo ani nahrání POUZE příslušných 3 souborů do updatovaného profilu, stejného původního profilu, jelikož žádný nový se při updatu nevytvořil, takže ani to nevedlo NIKAM pořád byla stejná chyba.  To další bylo všemožné zkoušení a není to podstatné, to není problém, problém je ten jak se jmenuje tento příspěvek/otázka.  Nechci slovíčkařit, ale když napíšeš ""neměl si nahrávat do toho profilu celou tu složku, ale jenom její obsah"", tak je to de facto úplně totéž. Obsah složky nebo stejně pojmenovaná složka je totéž. Ale to si tím říci nejspíše nechtěl, jak jsem napsal nepomohlo přepsání logins.json a key4.db a key3.db, nepomohlo přehrání záložního stejně pojmenovaného profilu, nepomohlo ani vytvoření nového profilu a nakopírování logins.json a key4.db a key3.db. Nebo dokonce přepsání nového profilu starým. Vždy buď nebyla data i když v profilu byla, nebo to hlásilo uvedenou chybu, nebo to, že si musím udělat NEW profil. Vše se změnilo až potom co jsem kompletně odstranil aktualizaci, tedy všechny soubory poznamenané verzí 73.  Takže asi tak. Problém vyřešen nebyl, příčina nebyla nalezena a odstraněna, vyřešil se pouze následek. Pomohl jsem si zálohou starého FF. Zakázal jsem aktualizace a budu doufat, že další FF mne nebude nutit jako většina současných programů a služeb se někde registrovat a někde něco ukládat nedej bože sdílet, protože tahle globální hloupost a posedlost je zhouba.

This can occur when web font downloads are blocked, or when Firefox is set to disregard page style rules and use a standard set of fonts.

(2) Is a setting or add-on blocking downloadable fonts? </p><p>For #1, go to the Options page: </p> <ul><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options </li><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences </li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it </li></ul> <p>Scroll down to the ""Fonts &amp; Colors"" section and click the ""Advanced"" button. </p><p>Then make sure the box is checked for ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above"": </p><p><img src=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2020-02-12-11-27-10-40ffbb.png"" width=""500""> </p><p>Any difference (you would need to reload the problem page, Ctrl+r or the circling arrow button, to see any difference)? </p><p>For #2, some add-ons have a feature to globally block downloadable fonts unless you specially allow them. Do you run uBlock Origin or NoScript, for example? In uBlock Origin, the setting is called ""Block remote fonts"". Since you already tested in Firefox's Safe Mode, that shouldn't be the explanation. </p><p>There's also a general setting to block downloadable fonts in about:config, if you think you might ever have changed that: </p><p>(1) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk. </p><p>(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste <strong>gfx.down</strong> and pause while the list is filtered </p><p>(3) If the <strong>gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled</strong> preference is bolded and ""modified"" to false, double-click it to restore the default value of true </p><p>Was it any of those things? </p> <blockquote>By the way, the automatically add button below this page doesn't work.

I want it to autosave most passwords, and it had been doing that fine. Then I noticed saved passwords were being rejected by sites, and when I clicked on 'view' to see what the saved password was that had been autofilled, it wouldn't be right. It would be a different login and password for a previous site. For instance, firefox was trying to autofill my college login with my personal email and a different password, not my .edu email. I haven't changed any behavior or gone into settings or done anything that seems likely to trigger this issue. Also can't find anything about it in search.

I have used this forum for more than 18 years and this is the first time this has happened, The site is a respected one, and a search for 'MSDN Forum' would provide a link(s) to my problem site. After a LOT of work trying to find what has happened has resulted in my finding that scripts and CSS seem to be skipped from being loaded by Firefox reporting the error message I mention in the title. These errors are MANY thoughout the incoming data. I subsequently tried to pursue Mozilla articles on Mixed Content Blocking, which seems to say Ishould have an option to 'disable' Firefox security with respect to the above via clicking on the 'sheild' icon and follow through to where there is supposed to be am option to 'stop/disble' - but there is no such option here so I can't check if that option is a cause of my issue. This issue is very severe as it disable ALL of the needed buttons - such as Reply, Quote and Post New Question - for a Forum, that is indeed severe! Now, I don't know if this whole issue is a fault with either Microsoft (who seem to be serving faulty data, or, Firefox for being overly coseting) I attach an image showing a portion of the errors (they extend throughout the entire list). Patricularly, the line at the top saying the Style Sheet could not be loaded summarizes the whole issue. Is there any other way I can get to disable Firefox being overly protective - I do know how to use the About:Config etc., but lack the ability to find anything relevant to this issue in any of the content there. </p><p>A further snippet of information: amongst other things, I reinstalled Window 10 and used Edge immediately after install had completed - same issues (suggesting that either both browsers are overly protective, or that the issues stem from Microsoft). I have tried most/all of the things likely to be suggested here suxh as using Safe Mode, no Extensions etc. </p><p>To save readers from becoming bored with this long essay, I'll stop here - if further info needed, just ask. </p>",firefox-730;websites;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,websites,en-US,1289487;1289908;1289924;1290123;1290743;,leshayathome,"id:1290743,created:2020-02-16 07:13:06 -0800,updated:2020-02-16 07:19:22 -0800,creator:leshayathome,updated_by:leshayathome,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Hi </p><p>OK, I have found the source of my problems. </p><p>My ISP had introduced a new feature they call Web Protect.

When an upgrade is available and I try it, I always(?) get a message saying that the Firefox Upgrade failed and that I should download and install the latest copy.  Can you guess why I now know to avoid that suggestion? ... </blockquote> <p>Download and installation of a new version of Firefox shouldn't affect the user Profile at all; same for the automatic updates. A user shouldn't need to backup their Firefox Profile on a regular basis. <em>Regarding Fred's advice; my advice is to take it 'with a grain of salt'. He brags repeatedly about using an old, legacy version of Firefox rather than using a Quantum version. I wonder how much experience he has had with the Quantum versions? Or is he providing advice as a by-stander? And his mention of MozBackup is reeeeal dated; that extension died like 6 or 8 years ago as far as being compatible with a current version of Firefox. IMO, living in the past rather than dealing with the present state of Firefox.</em> Don't get me wrong though, doing a backup of your Firefox Profile won't hurt you, but it's no magic elixir either.  </p> <hr> <p>One thing that is causing minor problems for some users is changes made with a major Firefox update that can affect <strong>userChrome.css</strong> customizations, which seems to be a ""constant"" for the last 4 or 5 Firefox versions. The user interface is being slowly changed, <em>(moving from XUL to HTML a step at a time)</em>  major version by major version, which may require the user to search out how to fix what got broken. </p><p>IMO, the biggest problem with userChrome.css changes seems to affect users who insist upon using userChrome code for moving the tab-strip to the top of the browser. And many of the codes that are being used are over complicated and thus more vulnerable to getting broken more frequently. </p> <hr> <p>That said,  your thread over here - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1264110"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1264110</a> - from 7 months ago mentions the Beta build. That is a slightly different situation than when using a Release versions, whereas the Beta receives many more updates that the Release versions receive; along the lines of 12 to 16 <em>(or so)</em>  updates over the 6 week Beta cycle [which is now reduced to 4 weeks]. </p><p>IMO, if you aren't <em><strong>testing</strong></em>  the Beta version to help with the development of Firefox and reporting the faults that you find with the ""next upcoming Release version"" - DON'T user the Beta version and thus increasing your frustrations with Firefox unnecessarily. I has been hard enough dealing with a Release updates every 6 weeks <em>(not counting the ""chem spill"" minor version updates between the major versions)</em>, but with the new 4 week Release schedule in 2020 it will be worse with ""stuff getting broken"" for users who use userChrome customizations. </p> id:1289345,created:2020-02-12 04:00:48 -0800,updated:2020-02-12 04:00:48 -0800,creator:My_Cheese_Is_Slippin,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>Good advice, FredMcd. </p><p>I backup my Profiles weekly and I keep an eye on the <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">Release Calendar</a>. </p> id:1289284,created:2020-02-11 20:56:31 -0800,updated:2020-02-11 20:56:31 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes2,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p><a href=""/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">Back up and restore information in Firefox profiles</a>.{web link} I use an add-on that makes backups of my user profile, Just In Case.

Firefox had no right to impose the verification email without letting the customer make sure his email can still recieve verification codes.

You click to start the verification process. The Firefox Account system sends a randomly generated code to the email address that you have on your account. You enter the code that received in your email (or click the link in the email that has the code included) and the Firefox Account system compares that to the code that it sent to you. if it's correct, you're verified.

In fact, many stolen passwords come from lists that can be purchased by attackers online. </p><p>For example, if you have an account on Company A, your login information is stored on Company A's system. What often happens in the technology industry are data breaches. This is when attackers manage to download a copy of the account information for a large portion of users. </p><p>Assuming hackers manage to break into Company A's system, they can download a copy of passwords for a lot of users. These passwords are usually the hashed version of the user passwords. In simple terms, the password the user enters is run through a complicated mathematical formula to produce what looks to the be random text. That's what's saved to Company A's system. </p><p>When you log in, the system takes the password that you enter, runs it through the same math formula and compares the result to what's saved in their system for your account. If it matches, they will let you in. </p><p>If hackers have access to that hashed password list, they can make unlimited guesses using their own automated systems. They will essentially try a variety of techniques to attempt to guess the right password. They will just run their guess through the same math formula and repeat until they get something that matches what they see on the list they stole. </p><p>The reason this is a problem is that many users online do something called ""password recycling"". It's the bad practice of using the same password on multiple accounts. </p><p>The reason this is an issue is that attackers can take the email address and known password they stole from Company A and attempt to login with the same information on Company B. It's not always successful, but if a user shares the same password for both accounts, that means the attackers now have access to both accounts. </p><p>And because the actual guessing of the passwords is done entirely on their own computers, the attackers don't need to make multiple guesses on a login page, so it can look just like a regular user logging in. If the website gets suspicious, they just change their IP address and now they just appear as a new device. </p><p>All that above is not to mention the relatively simple alternative methods that attackers can use to get the login information for your account. For example, installing a virus on your computer that uses a keylogger to track every key that you press on your keyboard. </p><p>As unlikely as it may seem, it happens... a lot. According to statistics, more than 2.5 billion accounts on the internet were hacked in 2018. More than 20% of internet users get hacked. It's an unfortunate reality of the internet. </p><p>This is why identity verification is <strong>very</strong> important when it comes to accessing sensitive data. This is why you won't be able to fully access the secured parts of your Firefox Account unless you are able to complete the verification process. </p> id:1289298,created:2020-02-11 21:44:43 -0800,updated:2020-02-11 21:44:43 -0800,creator:simon42,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes0,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>I believe if your company can’t provide knowledgeable and user friendly technical support on the issues of their customers, that company should abandon that business all together, our market is in so much need of carpenters and painters.

I am amazed that people haven't objected to Telemetry before.  I can truly understand why Mozilla developers would want Telemetry. A tool which is able to provide statistical information would be invaluable at pointing to bugs. My objection, however is about choice. If I turn off Telemetry then I don't want to have my Firefox do anything about collecting information for Telemetry. I don't want to collect it then discard it.  To get around this control we have another control called archive the Telemetry which just stores it locally so it can be sent later. After all a future update may temporarily turn on Telemetry, even if its only while it updates. Its is so Google and Microsoft.  Then there are pings. It doesn't send any information only that Firefox has started or ended or run first time etc. It is a really good way to time things so developers can make sure  results of their changes are as they expected. Hmm...pretty harmless.  I just snoop on a network and look for those pings. I can automate it and work out when that particular IP pings Mozilla.  That tells me when that particular Firefox was started and finished and that the owner is on a PC or MAC so that probably says when the computer is occupied. Paranoid? probably, but read the Facebook &amp; Google Privacy policies and if that doesn't scare you about your security/privacy then you are very naive. </p><p>By the way here is a shout out to all the moderators of these pages.

As a general rule, like most open source projects, there will be a fair number of Google, Microsoft, Oracle etc employees who are part of the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Companies or individuals are quite entitled to have an input, it is open source after all. </p><p>However, I do understand that something like a web browser used to generate money (adds, sale of data, (with or without permission), user preferences data) have different priorities to what the community at large expects from web browsers. </p><p>Generally Chrome has followed innovations made by Mozilla and Mozilla has followed innovations made by Chrome. </p><p>This is entirely appropriate. The only caveat I would put on this for Mozilla is they tell their users. </p><p>So the question still remains does Firefox collect any ""profile"" information on websites (apart from cookies &amp; history ) and if they do is it being disguised as Telemetry data? From the article linked above  .....as well as Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals....... The worrying part of this is the bit is  ...........or our partners such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals........ </p><p>That seems to suggest what I thought was Telemetry is really data about search engine  interactions.  </p><p>Isn't the result of ""search engine interactions"" the very data that google is using for their data mining for advertising preferences etc?. </p><p>So if I turn off Telemetry, none of this will be sent.

I finally did a System Restore to get back to version 72.0 and that fixed Firefox. I am unwilling to try updating to version 73.0 again.

I fixed that by re-installing Thunderbird, but it was an early version, so I went to Options and got the most recent Thunderbird update.

Neither backing up the bookmarks as .json file nor backing up HTML bookmarks allows me to recover. Is there any file I can save to ensure the favicons are backed up. At one time there was an add-on, ""Favicon Restorer"" that worked resaonably well but it has not been available for some time. Restoring favicons manually is an extremely time consuming process and is no guarantee the they will not disapper again. Any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-720;desktop;windows-81;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1288971;1288992;1288997;1289074;1289204;1289216;1289217;1289225;1289315;,Ulysses41,"id:1289315,created:2020-02-12 00:07:55 -0800,updated:2020-02-12 00:07:55 -0800,creator:cor-el,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes1,num_unhelpful_votes0,content:<p>favicons.sqlite stores favicons data.
