I'm sure they discovered the deficiency and happily, knowingly or unknowingly (most-likely the latter), accepted the Firefox developement-stated-plan(1) to specifically eliminate the hosts file from DNS resolution.  As you may guess, the tools I used largely revolved around the hosts file which I really liked as it was the least invasive, took so little additional CPU cycles (vs other solutions which I found unacceptable) as to be unnoticable, provided logging (allowing my wife and I to act as parents and address infractions), and was effective until the Firefox development team gave children better access to porn. </p><p>(1) - ref: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1453207"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1453207</a> ""Technically speaking, none of those entries *block* the name, they provide custom IP addresses for them.

A ""pointer to null"" is a block and/or trash-bin.  Technically speaking, viagra was a drug to help people with heart problems.  How many people know that?

Instead, when Firefox sends DNS requests to your operating system, your OS integrates the hosts file. Maybe you can guess my next comment. If you switch Firefox to using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) the DNS requests are not sent to your system for valid domains, only domains that the new DNS resolver doesn't recognize. So your hosts file never comes into play with that setting. Could that explain the problem, or is DoH off? You can check the status on the Preferences page.

This is my first ever attempt to get help, and I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. I noticed that Firefox now has a channel-app on Roku. But I only connect to my Roku Ultra streaming device using Ethernet. The Firefox browser which I use is located on my laptop, running Linux-Mint-Mate, distro 19 and it's also connected only by Ethernet to my network: My Roku device and my laptop are connected to the same Ethernet-only home network. The reason I cannot use wifi is that my wifi is too slow - Router is 16/4 and I think I'd need a new, much faster router 32/8, or better. But my laptop is very old and it's unlikely it can transmit wireless signals fast enough for a reliable HD signal anyway . . . I would like to be able to send streaming videos from my laptop, to my Roku Ultra - to my TV. (It is not a smart TV - it's just an old Panasonic Plasma HD TV). I have an NBC Sports Pass Gold - Cycling Pass subscription account which (because of their app's. limitations) cannot play all of the available videos from its Roku channel app, because their ROKU channel app's videos are limited to just the most recent 90-day posted events.  But all of the older videos from the earlier part of the season can always be played from their website, directly from my NBC account,  which is located only on my laptop. -So this means that I can only watch these older videos on my laptop. My Linux operating system is running on an older HP Elitebook laptop with a duel-boot setup with Windows XP.  If it is not possible to send these website-only videos across my network via Ethernet to my Roku Ultra device to my TV, could you tell me exactly what hardware devices etc. I would need to buy to do this successfully using wifi?  My wifi speed to my apartment is very, very fast - it uses Comcast's fiber-optic service.  Please note; I am only be able to follow very simple, step-by-step answers. I am elderly and I'm just a novice with computers etc.  Thank you very much for any help with explanations, and options that I might have to accomplish this.

Firefox no longer seems to support casting - the 'browser.casting.enabled' preference has been removed from the about:config list. The only exception seems to be Firefox for Android, a great mobile device browser imo, which works with the Chromecast device. Whether it supports Roku too I don't know, but it would be easy to try - if you have an android device. 2. Linux Mint will allow you to install other browsers besides Firefox (and alongside it). I understand that Chrome supports Roku though don't have chapter and verse for that. You would have to install it from the Chrome website but there are instructions out there on how to do that. Linux Mint will probably offer to install Chromium for you, which is the open source base for Chrome but I'm not sure if it supports casting in the same way as Chrome. Given that it's easy to install and uninstall in Linux my personal approach will be to just try it and see. 3. The 3rd point is the fact your PC doesn't have a wifi connection. I'm pretty sure the Roku works in a similar way to a Chromecast, which uses a system called wifi direct, in effect bypassing the network setup and transmitting device to device. However, it's possible that this will cope with an ethernet connection and simply use the wifi connection at the point in the chain where it starts to be used - the router in the case of your PC. Again, trial and error may well be as quick as deep research. </p><p>Sorry to leave so many open ends but the one thing that is sadly clear is that cannot currently at least use Firefox to cast to your Roku. I've no idea why that should be the case but it's a definite downside to using Firefox and I hope Mozilla are able to do something about it soon. </p><p>Good luck with your Roku.

In the question title, I incorrectly used the term ""push"". The term I intended to use (and hope is correct) is ""cast"". I have edited the title to correct the error. I am very sorry for the confusing error. What I'm trying to find out is whether or not it is possible to use the Ethernet connections currently in use on my network for my laptop and Roku ( the TV, has no Ethernet connection or wifi capability), to view videos on a TV that are only available to watch on my old laptop.  My laptop does have an HDMI connection but it will not work for connecting the TV to it as a second monitor, because my laptop's installed NVIDIA graphics hardware is too old to support the 2HD content of the NBC Gold Sports Pass Video. The NBC website video's even display poorly and choppy on the laptop, and it's connected by HS internet. Also there appears to be no way to reduce the video quality, so that it might stream properly. I can play YouTube standard HD videos with no problem.  . . . I'm guessing that the only practical option (one I can't afford) might be to get a new smart TV: maybe with some kind of built-in high speed - Chrome Browser? thank you for your help.

Mozilla seem to have decided that Firefox should give the impression of being slow or even reluctant to integrate with the platform it runs on. Either that or they've been dragging their feet for 10 years before even starting to implement features considered standard on the platform they've chosen to release for, like pinch-to-zoom. Even after a decade the feature is still so broken in Nightly that the competition was significantly better at it 5 years ago. Not to mention every other missing integration, like system text utilities like replacements and spell checker, access to system services in context menus, system picture-in-picture support, etc. I can't imagine that going from Nightly to Beta could possibly be anything other than going from bad to worse in this regard, and I just don't have the energy to keep reading bug reports to determine whether fixes for the latest features (from ten years ago) are present in the Beta channel as well.  </p><p>Even using Nightly for the remote chance of receiving an update that doesn't use 5x the energy of other browsers, and thus making Firefox an option when on battery power, would be worth it.  </p><p>Nightly is a tiny sliver of hope for the features I would otherwise be waiting, who knows, another ten years for. To me it's basically Nightly or no Firefox at all. To even be able to use it properly I have to edit config files just for the privilege to not be nagged about updates every five minutes, and I've just now realized that it wants to take away my decision of which version to use in the backward direction as well. If someone who is babysitting their browser to this extent can't simply downgrade without having the application intentionally throw roadblocks in the way then I think that's my cue to reevaluate the alternatives. </p><p>And that's why Nightly is (was) for me. </p><p>I wanted to see it succeed, so it's a bit sad to have to admit to myself that what I currently believe in most about Firefox is its market share.

En netflix por ejemplo me salen dos errores relacionados con el streaming y con html5 y me recomiendan instalar el media feature pack de windows, el cual ya tengo instalado, de hecho mozilla me lanza un mensaje cuando entro al netflix recomendandome que lo instale aunque ya esta instalado. Youtube, para los videos de streaming tambien me lanza un error relacionado con html5.  He probado con el microsoft edge y sin problemas.  He intentado reinstalar firefox y utilizarlo desde 0, sin plugins, y nada. He intentado reinstalar el microsoft feature pack y nada. he instalado paquetes de codecs y nada. Tanto firefox como windows como el feature pack estan actualizados a la ultima version, también adobe media player.

I tried navigating to Pinterest directly, through the Search bar, and couldn't do it - I got the usual list of sites but clicking on them did nothing.

I should add though, for others, this problem which is sites not loading and, more specifically, commercial sites (like phone companies, cloud security services, stores); they had all, somewhat recently, updated their sites to better suit phones and tablets. In some cases the sites, simply, did not load -- blank page. In others, the site looked fine but the login windows/frames were either non-existent or they didn't work. Also, a lot of the links did not work...and other small things. So, I will cut to the chase now. The culprit was an extension that Firefox has sanctioned for a long time, so I didn't consider it -- that extension is called 'NoScript' -- has never caused a problem in the past but something needs to be updated in it now -- my guess.

Using <code>max-height</code> has the same effect as setting the <code>height</code> manually, in this case. </p><p>Of course, you can adjust the transition duration if you want. I've set it to <code>5s</code> in this code, but it can be anything. You also need to set the <code>animation-delay</code> value to match whatever the <code>transition</code> time is. </p><p>One thing I also fixed in your code is the <code>overflow</code>. Having it set to <code>show</code> when hovering on the window causes some issues showing the drop-down menu from the address bar. Changing the <code>overflow</code> value to <code>unset</code> is a better option because it will restore that value to it's default when you are hovering and will allow the drop-down to be shown. </p><p>That's why I had to use an animation (the <code>@keyframes</code> part) to essentially delay the <code>overflow</code> value from applying. Because you can't really smoothly transition from a hidden overflow to visible overflow, you will get a pop-in effect when your mouse goes back on the screen. The animation stops the pop-in. </p><p>Hopefully this works for you. </p> id:1307173,created:2020-04-19 19:55:58 -0800,updated:2020-04-19 19:55:58 -0800,creator:rgrdgls69,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thank you Wesley Branton for your fast response. Your method worked perfect for what i wanted. The only other thing that would make this complete for me is to add a 5 second transition to the hide when the cursor leaves the window.

This userchrome.css plus the ""Youtube full windowed"" addon is ultimately what i did this for, so i can watch youtube videos fullscreen windowed with ease. The only issue i've had is when i hover between bookmarks on the bookmark toolbar, there is a 1 pixel line(not visible) that acts as if i move my cursor off the browser and everything quickly hides then unhides.

On the switch to Quantum, I felt the loss of Session Manager in particular, and finally settled on OneTab. On my work machine (Windows), I make semi-regular profile backups, and every once in a while I archive the current backup. On the upgrade to FFX 70 in October 2019, I lost all OneTab entries. (I apparently was not alone.) I immediately archived the most recent profile backup. I have tried a couple of times since then to figure out how to retrieve the OneTab data from the profile archive, but have always failed. I tried again this week, and am still failing. I contacted the OneTab development team via their website, but they never responded. Their information at  <a href=""https://www.one-tab.com/firefoxRestore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.one-tab.com/firefoxRestore</a> is outdated. </p><p>In the archived profile, under browser-extension-data\extension@one<a href=""http://-tab.com"" rel=""nofollow"">-tab.com</a> I find the file storage.js.migrated, which was created when the extensions changed their storage location to the IndexedDB. It is dated to March 25, 2019. I could retrieve entries from that file, but I would not recover the many tabs saved between March and October 2019. </p><p>This week, I uninstalled Firefox, set the current Firefox profile aside by renaming it, extracted the October 2019 profile to make it the current profile, went offline, installed Firefox 69.0.2, started Firefox, and displayed the OneTab overview page. Unfortunately, it was empty, so I restored the current FFX version and profile. </p><p>After more research, I very hopefully reviewed the instructions given at: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1275126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1275126</a> </p><p>I then performed them carefully using the folder from the archived profile, but on restarting Firefox, I got the same result, an empty OneTab overview page.

When I open it in an editor (like Notepad++), it does contain text snippets recognizable as references to many of the tabs I had stored. </p><p>How can I recover the information from this profile archive? </p><p>My desire to use OneTab faltered after this incident and their lack of support, but I have been putting off reducing the number of open tabs until I recover my lost tabs.

What is great about it is when you go to a page with a video like youtube a small box will appear on the top right outside the video asking if you want to download it and will give you a selection of options on resolutions and formats that are available. But it will download a whole website like I said or you can select pic formats or text or whatever you want on the site. Try the trial version. Think it is full trial for 21 days. You will be impressed. Before I discovered Internet Download Manager I did not have good experiences with anything with the name youtube downloader in it. Usually full of third party malware.

With this I get the permission popup for the microphone and everything works fine. 74.0 and now 75.0 does not popup the permission query but a box appears stating Firefox wishes to make changes to Windows Firewall. Even if I select allow it does not fix the microphone problem. Imaging hd back to 73.0 fixes the problem but at what cost over time? I do have Windows Firewall set to block incoming and outgoing traffic on Domains and Private networks and Public is set to default. I also have Local Security Policy set to treat any connection as Public and cannot be changed by user. So what has changed from 73.0 to 74.0/75.0 that my firewall settings would now impede Firefox from allowing the microphone to work or even producing the popup permission query? Running Win 7 x64 all updated. I am image obsessed and they are all clean and updated with no programs on them. 73.0 and previous work fine with my firewall settings. Firefox-1.png shows 73.0 working properly with Hangouts Firefox-2.png shows 75.0 wanting to change firewall settings which doesn't help and no microphone query. </p><p>Thanks for any pointers.

I did a clean install of firefox and upon importing my bookmarks backup via html some bookmarks failed to update their icon even though it was showing properly on the tab. Even with an identical address it would still be a globe. I tried everything from refresh, clear history, deleting and changing the name of favicons/places sqlite. Nothing worked. Again, this was a clean install. All other firefox sytem folders were also removed prior to re-installing. Program files, appdata, etc. all deleted prior to installing.  </p><p>After trying some things with no luck I found out that If you import your firefox bookmarks to chrome and re-load the bookmarks in chrome the icon refreshed to the correct one. I did that for all missing icons. I then exported the bookmarks as html, but before I imported them back into firefox i completely removed history and all bookmarks once again, and then restarted firefox. </p><p>Once firefox opened I imported the bookmark html from chrome and sure enough it worked. The bookmark icons were back to normal. To test i reloaded the page and even restarted firefox and they were all still ok. There is def an issue in firefox that prevents bookmark icons from refreshing properly. Hopefully the team will take a look into this and get a patch to firefox.  </p><p>I already fixed the issue but I wanted to post here to report my findings in case this was a bug?

Since then I have had trouble viewing ebay items.  After you do a ebay search a list of items show up.  When you open an item from a search list, you get a photo of the item usually on the left side and a description below the photo item.  However, below and after the description everything including other seller photos and text are on the left side of the page.  Normally they are across the page from the left side to right side.  But now the layout is all on the left side.  Everything is against the left side only and very hard to read.  For many years I have never run into this problem before.  I signed off and restarted Ebay with same problem.  Looked at my son's computer and the ebay layout looked correct like like mine use to.  I also opened up my google chrome browser and signed onto ebay.  The ebay photos and text were correctly located on the page.   So it appears that the recent update to firefox will not display the correct layout format in ebay.  Can I download to the previous version of firefox?  I 'm using latest Firefox browser 75.0 and running Windows 10.

On the first point: I checked the article.  This is a new set up.  And I have a Trend Micro running on the computer.

You can view, disable, and often remove unwanted or unknown extensions on the Add-ons page. Either: </p> <ul><li> Ctrl+Shift+a (Mac: Command+Shift+a) </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Add-ons </li><li> type or paste <strong>about:addons</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return </li></ul> <p>In the left column of the Add-ons page, click Extensions. </p><p>Then cast a critical eye over the list on the right side. Any extensions Firefox installs for built-in features are hidden from this page, so everything listed here is your choice (and your responsibility) to manage. Anything related to downloading, that looks suspicious, or that you just do not remember installing or why? If in doubt, disable (or remove). </p><p>Third, some malware may install its own copy of Firefox to sneak traffic over the network. If you have exited out of Firefox but you still see it running in the Windows 10 Task Manager (after allowing a half minute for it to complete its shutdown), we can suggest ways to investigate why that might be happening. </p>"

Of course, no other major browsers do this; my Chrome browser just opens up the pinned tabs from the previous session (only). But for some illogical reason, FF is different in that regard.

As far as I can tell, Firefox will write the PDF to its disk cache and retain it for the period allowed by the server. </p><p>I opened a PDF file URL in the viewer, and based on the date/time stamp and file size, discovered its file name in the cache was 9CA9415C5FC148EE9C3758B4A63AA9BD8D374573.

So based on that little test, anyone with the right tools and physical access could get the file. </p><p>If you control the server from which PDFs are being accessed, you could send a no-store header to prevent disk caching. Otherwise, I think it would be difficult to control what happens in Firefox or any other browser. </p><p>Alternately if your sites uses its own PDF viewer (similar to the one Outlook Mail uses for Firefox) then the PDF is never sent as a single file to Firefox, and the cache contains fragments of content as with other HTML pages. That would make recovery of the PDF content much more difficult. </p> id:1305970,created:2020-04-15 13:08:48 -0800,updated:2020-04-15 13:08:48 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I am glad to hear that your problem has been resolved.

I still have the backups so I'm wondering if the Lockwise and password information is located in another folder that I can copy and migrate.  Can anybody help me with this?

When I look at the SSL certificate that is being rejected, it is the old one from the old host. On my mac I also have Windows 10. The site opens fine on there and the certificate is correct.

Was there some performance or functional reason for taking away the little arrow in the address bar for most visited sites??? So now what used to be a simple single click is now a minimum of a click and a keystroke. And that's better? It's a different sequence and takes an extra action, so it's double the effort to get the same behavior. If you use this function a lot, which I do, those extra keystrokes add up very quickly and it's just very annoying because it used to function perfectly before. So this is an improvement how??? Was it change just for the sake of change? That was one of the features that brought me back to firefox from chrome. Chrome didn't have (and still doesn't have) anything like it.

It's just not the same list of sites that I previously got when I clicked the arrow.  If the url isn't highlighted when you click in the address bar, try double-clicking or triple-clicking.  You should be able to click and get the entire thing highlighted and with no need to backspace.  Even if I don't have the url highlighted, when I click on one of the items in the drop-down menu, it still goes to the new site. </p><p>In order for you to get Google back in your drop-down menu, you will need to follow the suggestion someone else posted to my question.  You need to open a new tab page first and it should show ""Top Sites.""  (If you have changed the new tab setting to a specific site, you'll need to temporarily change it back to the ""Firefox Home Default"" in your Options under the ""Home"" section.)  Find the three dots at the top right corner of the ""Top Sites"" section.  When you hover over it, it says ""Menu.""  Click that to get the Menu.  There you can see an option to add a Top Site.  You'll need to type the url or copy and paste.  Once you add the new Top Site, it is pinned to the page.  It will also be at the top of your drop-down menu when you click in the address bar.  You can pin multiple sites.  (If a site you want to pin is already listed on the page, just drag it to the top row and it will be automatically pinned.) </p><p>This isn't as good what we had before they took away the arrow, but at least it gives us some of the sites we want to quickly reach.  For the others, save them as Bookmarks, or even use the Bookmarks Toolbar.  Then you won't have to be typing so much in the address bar.  Years ago, I used the Yahoo Toolbar until it was no longer supported.  I added the sites to the Bookmarks Toolbar as a substitute.  So I have my Yahoo Mail page, Facebook, Google Maps, and a couple of other pages listed at the top of my browser in the toolbar; all I have to do to go to the page is click a button.  (The only downside is that the old Yahoo toolbar used to notify me when I had new mail. Now I have to visit the page to check.) </p> id:1321068,created:2020-06-06 23:38:42 -0800,updated:2020-06-06 23:38:42 -0800,creator:cspsound,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>jscher2000, </p><p>I think that you have missed the point/problem that others have asked and as of today (7th June) I have had the same problem and it is most annoying and should be fixed by Firefox immediately. </p><p>To try and explain in the words of a non IT person (simply a long time Firefox user). </p><p>Before today when you opened Firefox and your home page loaded, at the RH end of the URL bar was a small inverted triangle.  </p><p>If you clicked on this triangle it brought up a drop down list of your most visited sites which in my case are/were (hotmail, Google, ebay, my business URL, local weather bureau, MSN news, etc), then all that you had to do was to mouse click the site you wanted to visit and it appeared in the URL bar and you were straight to it, then once in that site if you wanted to visit another frequently visited site you repeated the process again by clicking on the triangle and then from the drop down list mouse click the new site. </p><p>Since the upgrade today this triangle is missing and the only way to get to the drop down menu is to highlight what ever URL is in the URL bar and use the ""Backspace"" key to clear the URL bar, then place the mouse in the now empty URL bar and the menu box appears and then you have to mouse click the one you want. </p><p>You now have to repeat this process for every frequently used site that is in the menu box list. </p><p>If the selected URL is very long so that it extends past the end of the URL line, you might have to highlight the showing part of the URL and ""Backspace"" it and once that part is cleared highlight the next part and clear it and so on until the URL bar is completely clear. </p><p>For example if (say) <em><strong> <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> </strong></em> was showing it would take one highlight and Backspace operation but if (say) <em><strong>.9news.com.au/national/four-children-killed-in-townsville-road-crash-one-injured-queensland-news/59bb839f-e0e9-437b-8c2b-6bdcf03dbe04 </strong></em> was in the URL bar it would take a number of highlight/Backspace operations to get to an empty URL bar. </p><p>Removing the triangle button surely could not be considered by any sane IT person as a good and/or progressive move and I am sure that if it is not rectified very soon (preferably within the next 48hrs), me along with many other long time Firefox users will start looking for a more logical browser. </p><p>If you can think of any way to bring back the triangle feature or remove the latest upgrade so that all of the features that were in the previous versions can be restored (and simply so that users like me can easily understand the process !!!) it would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Also for some reason my most visited site and the one that was at the top of the drop down list -- Google -- is now completely missing from the list and the only way to get to it is to completely type in its URL address every time --- this more than annoying, but I can't use the words I would like to be able to use. </p> id:1313003,created:2020-05-15 19:39:12 -0800,updated:2020-05-15 19:39:12 -0800,creator:jscher2000,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<em><p>ajpeavler <a href=""#answer-1312991"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>I did now change the options for my ""top sites"" to be 2 rows instead of 1 row; that added more sites to my new tab page, but they still don't show up when I click the address bar. </blockquote> <p>For the drop-down, there's currently no way to increase beyond eight Top Sites. </p> id:1312991,created:2020-05-15 18:22:26 -0800,updated:2020-05-15 18:22:26 -0800,creator:ajpeavler,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Thanks.

You can check this by going to the Firefox options page and selecting <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> from the sidebar. If you scroll down to the <strong>History</strong> section, you should uncheck the <strong>Always use Private Browsing mode</strong> option, if it's visible and is checked. If you uncheck it, you will be asked to restart Firefox. </p><p>Their other observation is that you have a file called <code>user.js</code> in your Firefox profile folder (the place where your Firefox data is saved). There's a variety of reasons why that file might be there, but it can often cause issues with certain Firefox add-ons or even Firefox functionality. </p><p>The easiest way to check this is to go to the <code>about:support</code> page in Firefox and select the <strong>Open Folder</strong> button in the <strong>Profile Folder</strong> row of the <strong>Application Basics</strong> table. That opens the aforementioned profile folder that your Firefox data is saved to and where this <code>user.js</code> file is saved. </p><p>In that folder, you can find the <code>user.js</code> and what you want to do is make it so that Firefox doesn't open this file anymore. That will help determine if that file is causing any issues. There are two common ways to do this. You can either rename the file to something else, like <code>user-old.js</code>, or you can move the file somewhere else, like to your desktop instead. Either way, Firefox won't be able to see that file anymore, but the file will still be there in case removing it breaks something else in Firefox (which is rare). That's why we rename or move the file instead of deleting the file completely, because if you delete it, it's gone. </p><p>Once you've done that, restart Firefox and see if you can get the extensions to work again. </p><p>The final thing that Cor-el suggested, should nothing else work, is to delete the files that Firefox has saved on your computer to keep track of what extensions you have installed. It's not very common, but sometimes these files get damaged and Firefox has issues reading them properly. </p><p>To see these files, you need to open the profile folder (just as we did above). You are looking for any file that's just called <strong>extensions</strong>. There can sometimes be a couple, so you will want to delete all of them (or move them to your desktop). However, you should not delete/move files called something else (like <code>extension-preferences</code> or <code>extension-settings</code> for example) and you should not delete the folder called <code>extensions</code> or anything within that folder. </p><p>Cor-el has also suggested deleting (or moving) the <code>compatibility.ini</code> file from your profile folder (if you see it). All the information that you are deleting is recreated by Firefox when you open it up again. </p><p>Then you should open Firefox again and see if the problems that you were having are now fixed. </p> <blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> Firefox should be closed before removing or moving any files. Sometimes your computer will not allow you to do that when Firefox is open.</blockquote> <p>Hopefully I've not an adequate job translating what cor-el has wrote above for you and, more importantly, hopefully it fixes the issue for you. </p> id:1308454,created:2020-04-25 09:14:23 -0800,updated:2020-04-25 09:14:23 -0800,creator:Sin_Shadow_Fox,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Ok so i don't understand cor-el's post and i haven't heard anything from him in 2 weeks so if any one would like to attempt to translate what he said for me or who knows whats wrong with my firefox then feel free. </p>"

There appeared what they call a Reader View icon (that I learned about through my searches) that turns blue when clicked on. Also when I click on the address bar and/or the search bar it illuminates outlined in red. Did Firefox do this? Or have I been hacked?

I'm not tech savvy enough to try your solution. I'd probably end up breaking Firefox somehow. I wish it was simpler. In other answers that I had found, it said you could press and hold the icon and a menu would appear and choose remove, but I don't get that option. The red or pink that appears is a thin line that lights up when I click on the address bar and search bar. I didn't choose any themes, so I hope I'm not being hacked. I'll take your word for it that it's Firefox. You gave quite a professional answer to my query.

I clicked on ""confirm"" and nothing happened.  I clicked on it 2 or 3 more times, and the next thing I knew, FireFox took over my machine by infinitely creating new tabs.  I'd close it and it would immediately pop back up to the top of the stack, preventing me from doing anything else.  The Task Manager couldn't kill it.  I eventually managed to uninstall it, and frankly, at this point I'm not sure I want to reinstall it.  What the devil was this all about?

I've had two gmail accounts for years, and for years I've been able to log into both of them at the same time (so simultaneous gmail accounts in the one Firefox window is not new - it's just the ability to separate them) and have both accounts open at the same time.  I usually have both of them pinned.  I figured that containers would continue to allow this, but separate them into containers for privacy.  Apparently not successfully.  It logs one in to it's container perfectly, pinned and all, but the second one continually requires me to confirm that I'd like it in it's container and ONCE AGAIN, click 'remember' (I click that each time), and repin the tab.  It KNOWS which container I want, but still needs to actually ASK, and it unpins my tab every single time I open Firefox.  This is a pain in the arse.  It was, quite frankly, more convenient pre-containers.  Pre-containers, they both logged in automatically, Firefox opened with  and pinned fine.  It does appear to keep them separate, but with added inconvenience of having to redo it every time I open Firefox. </p><p>The reason I wanted containers was to separate work surfing and personal surfing, since Google is also attached to Youtube etc, so that I can keep my searches at home separate to those at work (my workplace doesn't need to know which games I play, lol!)  I'm really reconsidering whether I should just have a whole new Google address for work that I just have for work searches and not use it at home at all, and dump containers, however I do need to use the gmail account at home, too sometimes, so I'd have to log in and out to check it. </p><p>Is this a bug that is actually going to get fixed?  Is there a work around.  I'm pretty tired of opening Firefox, going straight to the second gmail address, confirming that I'd like it to open in the container that it ALREADY KNOWS I want to open it in, ticking 'remember' (again), and REPINNING my tab.  It's like it just won't save my decision. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p> id:1304933,created:2020-04-11 19:31:36 -0800,updated:2020-04-11 19:31:36 -0800,creator:ComputerWhiz,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:2,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Unfortunately, at the moment, it's not possible to automatically separate two accounts on the same website into different containers.

1284190,2020-04-11 03:05:47 -0800,2020-04-12T22:37:02Z,Problem turning off URL-bar auto-suggestions in Firefox,"<p>(I remember posting this before, but I am unable to find it anywhere. Perhaps it wasn't stored. I apologize in advance for duplicate posting!) </p><p>I use Firefox 75.0 (64-bits) on mac OS X Catalina for browsing. It gives me the following issue. When I start typing a youtube… URL in the address bar, a specific sub-page to the YouTube domain pops up first. It refers to s specific clip on youtube. While I’m typing, in front of it a grey star appears, such a marking a favorite. However, it’s NOT in my favorites.  The auto-suggestions do not come from other opened tabs. This option is turned off.  I don’t use any Firefox subscription account services for storing favorites online. Suggestions from search engines are also toggled off.  I’ve tried all remaining suggestions on the following pages to get rid of this issue: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions</a> 1st method for clearing a single item didn’t work; 3rd method to clear my browsing history didn’t work. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978</a> I have turned off browser.urlbar.autoFill = false. Toggling this option, at least, got rid of unsolicited suggestions from the worldwide web such as <a href=""http://youtubemoneycalculator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtubemoneycalculator.com</a>. It’s a partial success! </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1213978</a> keyword.enabled is set to false, but toggling this won’t make any difference. browser.fixup.alternate.enabled is set to false, but toggling this won’t make any difference. </p><p><br> The only method that makes a difference is to turn off Addres bar suggestions from Favorites (in about:preferences#privacy). But then I don’t get any suggestions at all… </p><p>This example merely illustrates the issue with youtube… domain names, it happens with any address that I start typing in the address bar. Peculiarly, addresses that ARE stored in my favorites, do not appear first in the suggested domain names. Okay, I’ve done my homework! </p><p>My conclusion/question: Some (former) favorites are stored in a location that I have no access to. I would like to receive suggestions as to where I can find these. Preferably, I do not want to delete every single one of them one by one. </p><p><br> Bottom line: It would be nice if I had some sort of control over my favorites. The suggestions appear to be totally random. If the most recently or most frequently visited favorites would appear first, that would make sense. Or if the main page would appear first (<a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>) and not any other subpages. Does anyone know if this is possible and then, how to achieve this? </p><p>Lastly: I don’t understand why a browser that claims to be so concerned about my privacy allows for so many unwanted options. Also, it is a nuisance if these options are actually reset with every update Firefox installs. I have the impression that this happens. I did notice that now and then additional search engines are added to my one-click-search engines (about:preferences#search) without my prior notification.

So perhaps the printable page version is intended for browsers that do not support print media style sheets (or JavaScript)? </p><p>If your intention behind opening the printable version is that it will save more cleanly, you'll have to continue working around the script, or use an add-on to strip the script. (I don't think completely disabling JavaScript would be a workable approach.) But if you are just looking to print, I think you can use the main page. </p>"

Have you already found the new approach to taming the enlargement? </p><p>It involves creating a <strong>userChrome.css</strong> file to modify the appearance of the user interface area. Your first time, please set aside 10 quiet minutes to go through it since there are several steps. </p><p>(For anyone who already has a working userChrome.css file set up, you just need to add the rules you downloaded under (A) to your file.) </p><p><strong>(A) Download a rules file</strong> </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/samples/userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</a> </p><p>Use the downloads list on the toolbar to open the downloads folder directly to the new userChrome.css file. (See attached screenshot) </p><p>Minimize that file browser window for later reference. </p><p><strong>(B) Create a new</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder in your profile folder</strong> </p><p>The following article has the detailed steps for that (#1, #2, and I recommend #3) </p><p><a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html</a> </p><p><em>I have videos for both Windows and Mac in case the text is not clear.</em> </p><p><strong>(C) Move the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file you downloaded in Step A into the</strong> <code>chrome</code> <strong>folder you created in Step B</strong> </p><p><strong>(D) If you do not already have a</strong> <code>userChrome.css</code> <strong>file, Rename the</strong> <code>userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css</code> <strong>file</strong> </p><p>Highlight userChrome-ZeroEnlargement.css and choose Rename (using whatever method Finder offers).

I find I have to use an alternate browser to get to the connection page because Firefox refuses to load it. Basically, I get the message that I have to login to the network; I click the ""Connection"" button, and a page loads that tells me the wifi login page isn't secure. I click the ""Advanced"" link, and I can then either 1) Cancel, 2) View the Certificate, or 3) Proceed at my own risk. I choose 3, and Firefox does nothing. I click the link, and the link seems to be dead ... it literally just does nothing. </p><p>This is really annoying. I connect to this network daily. I understand the network isn't configured properly, but I'm not the admin and I can't do anything about it. I resent FF for preventing me from connecting while seeming to give me the opportunity to connect. I've tried changing settings in about:config, but nothing works. I end up loading Chrome just to get to the login page for the network, where I then connect, and then immediately kill Chrome and go back to whatever I was trying to do. It's so annoying I have considered just abandoning Firefox, but I've been using it since 2005 and really don't want to use Chrome. </p><p>How can I get around this behaviour and connect to the wifi network using Firefox?

As opposed to serving up from my website at localhost, I didn't check to see if ""file:///"" would display the thumbs from their current file system location. </p><p>As an aside, I use the domain name www.moo.cow for my local site, registered through the ""registrar"" in the hosts file! </p><p>I am looking for a way to reduce the font size of the titles.  I used to have an 18-inch widescreen and now a 27 inch widescreen monitor, so I don't need the large fonts.  Made no difference when I went into preferences and reduced the size of displayed fonts for web pages, which setting is overridden to let web pages specify fonts and sizes.  ""YouTube"" reads out as ""YouTu..."" at current size. </p><p>Need info on resizing the displayed font in Top Sites and I should be all cleaned up on this topic. </p><p>Also, please, some guidance on how to start a new topic here?  I go through the ""Need help"" box and used to be at the bottom of the list was a place I could ask my question.  I would check through the suggestions and then as needed ask a new question.  I had a question about Thunderbird here I would like to get some guidance on. </p><p>Thank you! </p> id:1304221,created:2020-04-10 01:54:17 -0800,updated:2020-04-10 01:54:17 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello  Linux_Mint_Firefox, </p><p>When you hover over the upper right corner of such tile,  you'll see three dots.

After upgrading to 75.0, my containers are getting confused. </p><p>On my Linux, since I have two Office365 corporate email accounts, I usually open them in different containers (Default Container and Work Container) to be able to open them at the same time.  Since this morning, when I try to open my email into the ""default"" container, it keeps auto-switching to the ""work"" container.  It is not letting me open my Office365 into the ""default"" container.   The reason why it started to happen this morning even though Firefox upgraded 4-5 days ago, it is because I just rebooted my laptop this morning.  It was not rebooted for a week, so this bug did not show up earlier. </p><p>As far a Windows10, since it is a Virtual Machine, I noticed it immediately when Firefox auto-upgraded last week to version 75.0 (since I reboot it all the time, so issue showed up upon first reboot).   In the case of Windows 10, I have several Gmail accounts (One for myself, one for daughter, one for son, etc...).  So my Gmail is in the ""default"" container, my son is in ""son"" container and daughter is in ""daughter"" container.  Immediately after the upgrade to Firefox 75.0, whenever I try to open any Gmail (from any container ... no matter which container it is), it auto-switch to one specific container (Let's call it the ""yellow"" container).  I have tried from 6 different containers, and it always goes to the ""yellow"" container.   What's even worse, it is not opening anymore my Gmail anymore, even in the ""yellow"" container.  The only way for me to open my Gmail at this moment is by opening it in a ""private"" window.   When I tried to roll-back to 74.x, whenever I open Firefox, it asks me to create a new profile (a blank one) and it is refusing to use my normal profile (the one containing all my bookmarks, my tab, my configuration).  It states that ""things"" got upgraded to a new format (or something like that).  The only way to be able to open my ""normal"" profile is to upgrade again to v75.0. </p><p>That's definitely a bug with Firefox 75.0 because I have been using this Containers settings since Mozilla implemented the containers features N years ago.  So for several and several versions of Firefox, it has been working without an issue, but the bug only showed in v75.0 </p><p>Please note that I already reported it as a feedback last week as soon as I noticed it.  But I guess this was not the proper place to report it then. </p> id:1304416,created:2020-04-10 12:24:27 -0800,updated:2020-04-10 12:24:27 -0800,creator:asanchez1234,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:1,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I'm new to the forum, so question on the resolve.

Is that just something in the new version, or is there another adjustment to make to get that arrow back. </p> id:1304197,created:2020-04-10 00:02:05 -0800,updated:2020-04-10 00:02:05 -0800,creator:were_cat3,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>@cor-el @philipp </p><p>Setting ""browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus "" to false fixed the problem.

I know that I can probably go in the printing setting to change it for that page and that might fix the problem. But for my project, I need to do this nearly 150 websites everyday. So fiddling around with every other website and Firefox print setting is not an option. I have attached a sample print to PDF to show the problem. When I print, half the content is hidden. In contrast, whenever I use Google Chrome, I never have this issue. The default printing settings just work, every single time in Chrome. I don't want to switch to Chrome because I want to support the Mozilla/Firefox mission. But the minor issues in Firefox are frustrating. </p><p>Between the lack of a translation tool that can translate the webpage and the poor default printing setting, I am nearly ready to switch. Firefox developers, if you're reading this, please fix this printing issue. While you're at it, please add an inbuilt webpage translation tool. Nobody want to copy and past webpages to translate them. I really want to stick with Mozilla, but you have to improve these little features within the browser.  </p><p>Actually never mind, cannot attach the pdf to show the issue in this forum. FANTASTIC (sarcasm)! Here is a sample screen shot instead.

What that means is that there are multiple processes running at a time. When it was first added to Firefox, this feature was called <em>Electrolysis</em> or <em>e10s</em>. This allows Firefox to separate certain tasks and has various security and performance benefits. </p><p>For example, the main Firefox program runs in a process, your browser add-ons run in another process and the websites you visit run in their own process as well. </p><p>Now assume that a website you visit freezes. In the past, when Firefox was just running in one process, that may have crashed the entire browser. But now, you would most likely get an error message that says the tab has crashed and it would allow you to reload that tab without having to restart the entire browser. </p><p>The Mozilla blog post <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/04/11/the-why-of-electrolysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">The “Why” of Electrolysis</a> from April 11, 2016 does a good job explaining the benefits of having a multi-process program, as does the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox/Motivation"" rel=""nofollow"">Motivation for Multiprocess Firefox</a> page on MDN. </p><p>Many other programs, including other internet browsers are multi-process programs. </p><p>If you go to the Firefox settings page and scroll down to the <strong>Performance</strong> section, you can uncheck the <strong>Use recommended performance settings</strong> option, which will give you a little more customization. There you can set the <strong>Content process limit</strong>, which will restrict how many processes Firefox can use for displaying the websites that you visit. See <a href=""/en-US/kb/performance-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox's performance settings</a>. </p><p>However, it's generally recommended to leave the <strong>Use recommended performance settings</strong> option checked and allow Firefox to adjust the settings on it's own based on your system. </p><p>Hope this answers your question. </p>"

But today I need to reboot my computer due to things getting slow. Once I rebooted I had noticed when I had opened Outlook Email in my Firefox Browser the ""Junk E-mail Folder"" had disappeared. I immediately went to my standby browser on 'Edge' and checked to see if things had also changed on my Outlook E-mail account, it was all good nothing missing or changed.

Sometimes an existing tab will freeze, demonstrating the page until I scroll, whereupon new parts scrolled to of the page are just gray, and even old parts that have been scrolled off-screen come back gray, and the page is effectively an image since it's unresponsive, and even typing a new page into the URL bar doesn't do anything. </p><p>What makes this particularly disruptive is that by seemingly random chance and independent of the site being visited, the tab will be useless.  The tab can't be made to work again, it will be frozen until closed and another tab created.  This happens more than 50% of the time and either has gotten worse or more annoying to me over time.  Usually I will middle click a link ten times and open one of 1-3 tabs that worked.  Recently I closed several tabs but wanted to restore one, so I spammed Ctrl+Shift+T, but half the tabs were broken and irrecoverable (except through History). </p><p>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I reset firefox and updated everything for this post.  I have no addons installed, and the plugins are OpenH264 (1.8.1.1), Shockwave Flash (32.0.0.344), and Widevine Content Decryption Module (4.10.1582.2).  There are no recent crash reports in about:crashes. </p><p>Super looking forward to fixing this, the browser is unusable in its current state.  Worth mentioning, this also happens on my Windows machine, but I'd like to fix it first on Linux unless Windows is helpful for diagnosis. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;tabs;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1303510;,helasraizam,"id:1303510,created:2020-04-07 21:29:00 -0800,updated:2020-04-07 21:29:00 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:1,content:<p>Are you using the browser from Mozilla or Linux? </p><p><br> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">Start Firefox in Safe Mode</a> {web link} </p><p>A small dialog should appear.

The unusual memory use may be due to add-ons, hidden tabs, malware, etc., that persisted or were reintroduced after his Firefox Refresh.  </p><p>Perhaps the Safe Mode test -- if he tries it -- will help provide more information to eliminate potential causes and reach a solution.

Why does Sync not preserve the separate windows?  With well over a hundred tabs open, this makes recovering/accessing this information very tedious - as all the tabs have to be opened individually, and then sorted into separate windows again, to be bookmarked in their search subject categories/windows!  Was this just an oversight, or is it technically not possible to preserve separate windows in Sync?   </p><p>If it is technically not possible to preserver multiple windows of tabs in Sync, it would be much more workable if it were possible to mark these tabs in Sync to re-open them, rather than have to open them individually or all of the tabs at once from that other machine.

This is not a ""backup"" question.  I had a windows install that ""died"" and was not longer able to boot.  I had a bunch of research in many Firefox windows, each of them a different facet or subject, with a bunch of tabs in each window.  </p><p>Using Sync on another machine, I no longer have the delineation of subjects (separate windows); but rather just a whole bunch of tabs - all mixed up now. </p><p>If Sync does not keep separate ""window delinations"" of a Firefox session, then Sync is not very useful.  I understood it to have the purpose of having your present Firefox session (including of course settings, previous bookmarks, etc.) available to you where ever you could log on to your account, i.e. working at the office, then continuing your work later at home.   </p><p>If Sync won't keep separate windows of tabs, then yes, bookmarking and backup up on portable media is the only way to take your ""work"" with you to another machine.  So why even have Sync?  Just always backup and write to portable media to take it with you!  Sync is only slightly more useful as it will communicate your settings, bookmarks, etc. for use in a different location and machine.  And as in this case, when a machine is no longer functioning, at least tabs of your previous session are accessible.  But this is certainly not ideal - as it would be having your session available exactly like it was, with the windows preserved. </p><p>You still haven't answered my questions about ""why"" this is.  Perhaps you don't know, and if so, a simple ""I don't know"" would be appreciated.  The questions again are ""why"" does Sync not preserve windows?  Is it technically not possible?  Is this ""function"" an oversight?  Is this function possible in the future?  Or is there some reason it would never see the light of day? </p><p>In addition I asked: when restoring Sync tabs, why is it not possible to choose/mark as a group those that you want to restore, instead of having to open them one-by-one (very time consuming with a high number of tabs!); or the only other alternative is to open ALL of them at once from another machine, and possible overwhelm this iteration of Firefox now being used on another machine (which might have less RAM/slower cpu/slower internet speed)? </p><p>Thanks if you can directly answer these questions.
