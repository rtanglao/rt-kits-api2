</p><p>Months ago I learnt the Firefox geolocalize you by using Google's API, and that if you want to get a fix position, then you have to change the geo.wifi.uri property to
</p><pre>   ""data:application/json,{""location"": {""lat"": your_lat, ""lng"": your_long}, ""accuracy"": 27000.0}"".
</pre>
<p>A month or two months ago I remember I used google maps and was working as expected, with the coordinates I put in geo.wifi.uri. Today I was very surprised to find that Firefox was giving me my real coordinates even that geo.wifi.uri hasn't changed. I haven't changed my ISP provider, and the updates haven been the normal ones, for Windows 10 and firefox. Now I'm using Firefox 74.0 (64-bit). What's happening here?
