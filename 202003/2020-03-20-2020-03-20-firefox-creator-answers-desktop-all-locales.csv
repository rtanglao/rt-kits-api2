Why ?,"<p>Resume :  </p><p>All info (password, historic, favorites, everything) stored on a new sync account was lost.  </p><p>Before the problem :  </p><p>I made the new account, syncronized it with my current cookies, once saved i formated the pc. THen logged and did a syncronization on the new distro's firefox, and everything (cookies) was loaded perfectly. That was months ago. The account remained logged this whole time. </p><p>( account maded on ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, and logged on lubuntu 19.04) </p><p>Problem : </p><p>Now i re-made this whole process (formating the pc and loggin on this same sync) , but this time there was no data at all. Was like a new account. Maybe even worse, because a new account should have at least one historic page. But this account's historic was  totally erased.  Even if the account was not syncronizing and saving my cookies after i've logged on the new distro, it did saved the cookies from the old distro, so at least these cookies  should be there. </p><p>(account loaded on lubuntu 19.10) </p><p>After the problem : </p><p>After the loss of its data, the blank sync account have beeing sucefully sycronizing (loading and saving) new cookies, but never the old ones.  </p><p>What i tried : </p><p>Re-syncronized. Re-logged on other devices (android and linux). re-installed firefox. Redifined the password.  </p><p>Why its unlikly i made a mistake : </p><p>I'm a old user of firefox sync (in other accounts) on a live-linux distro, so i'm constantly loggin into my other Sync account and syncronizing my data.  And never i had a problem were i losed my saved historic/favorites/passwords. Anything. So is very unlikely that i made a mistake ... I even have old confirmation emails, proving the account was created on a device, and then logged on a new device, wich required a confirmation password. </p><p>My conclusion : A sync Account was created, cookies were saved into it, then they were deleted and the browser  stopped saving new cookies on the account. I didn't realized because the cookies were alredy stored on my local drive. When i made a new logging, the browser started to save cookies again, and those weren't remains, because they weren't deleted.  </p><p>Could it be that firefox's servers had a malfunction and my data were lost ? Nothing else make sense to me now. </p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>",firefox-740;sync;desktop;linux;,firefox,sync,en-US,1298994;1299016;1299362;1299363;,eliasbenin

Firefox does not supports this feature.. Why? Question number 2: After setting up master password when I want to save any login info and pass it wants master pass, if I want to view my saved login info it also wants pass. Isn't it annoying to enter pass again and again? So why do you guys add features like Google chrome did? (adding Windows hello feature). It is more comfortable don't you guys think the same?

This is directed to Firefox as an organization. I DEPEND on Firefox. I have 90 - 100 tabs open in multiple accounts, I bought into ""if it doesn't run in the browser"" - I don't want it. Last week, Firefox stopped loading Gmail. Not Gmail Contacts or Calendar - just Gmail. But Gmail worked in if opened in a private window, After much anguish for days, I learned that Right Clicking on a working web page (in the Private Window) allowed me to delete Cache and Cookies FOR JUST GOOGLE. I did it and signed in and whuddaya know, Gmail works again. OK - a blip in the force. Now Slack doesn't work. Exact same symptoms - just non responsive to <a href=""http://slack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">slack.com</a>. Ah Ha I said. Firefox 74 is NFG. Let's just reinstall 73. Ooooh - the miracle minds at Firefox NO LONGER ALLOW DOWNGRADING - BECAUSE (wait for it) - ""most of these problems are not due to an upgrade"". Really? Most? This is not about being polite. This is about allowing a user to revert to a working version when a problem hits. Firefox is losing market share and if you want to know why. Well - here it is. It's unreliable. BTW: I was able to revert Gmail because I had other tabs signed in. I only have 1 Slack tab. I tried using the Private Window tab - nope. I USE Firefox to (1) make my life easier and (2) be more productive than my cohorts. Fail on 1 of those: not good. Fail on both: hello Chrome or any other browser that just works. P.S. I've been using Firefox for...hmmm I'm 70 and its unlikely there was a whole decimal digit in front of my starting version. C'mon guys. </p>",firefox-740;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1298788;1298836;,garylaverysr
