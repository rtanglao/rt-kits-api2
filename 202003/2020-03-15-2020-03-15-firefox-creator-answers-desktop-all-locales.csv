I've searched the web as to how to do this with firefox.  I've tried to simply use the instructions for chromium but change things over to  firefox, but I'm not sure what the equivalent paths/files are in firefox.
</p><p>I've got a VM (to test with) and got the chromium setup working (just so that I know X and openbox are behaving).  Here is where I'm getting stuck in /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart:
</p>

<p>sed -i 's/""exited_cleanly"":false/""exited_cleanly"":true/' ~/.config/chromium/'Local State'
</p><p>sed -i 's/""exited_cleanly"":false/""exited_cleanly"":true/; s/""exit_type"":""[^""]\+""/""exit_type"":""Normal""/' ~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences
</p><p>chromium-browser --disable-infobars --kiosk '&lt;http://your-url-here&gt;'
</p>
<h6 id=""w__2"">===</h6>
<p>I'm not at all sure where the equivalent of ""~/.config/chromium/""Local State"" would be for firefox.  Surely under the ./mozilla/firefox directory, but I know not where.
</p><p>Same thing for the second sed line, no idea about the equivalent.
</p><p>The actual command I presume is 'firefox --kiosk 'url of choice'
</p><p>I've commented out the 'sed' lines and get firefox to start ONCE, but it alwasy exits X uncleanly and times out with getting a lock on .Xauthority.  If I remove firefox and delete the .mozilla folder and then reinstall firefox, it will again work only once.  When it does work like this, it takes about two minutes for firefox to come up as compared to the chromium setup that only takes several seconds.
</p><p>Any thoughts or help would be VERY appreciated.

When I follow the link to unsubscribe, I'm prompted to log into my account. When I log in, I'm prompted to confirm my account via a verification link sent via email. However, that email to my iCloud account never arrives. I've tried repeatedly to have it resent without success. I've had a case escalated via Apple support up to their engineering department, and they say the email isn't getting filtered by them but in fact never reaches their servers, so there's nothing they can do. So now I'm stuck on this mailing list because I can't access my account. Blocking me from leaving the list seems illegal per the CAN-SPAM act. Even being able to log in here seems short-lived, since it appears that tomorrow (16 March) my Mozilla support account will be merged into that same Firefox account that I can't access. Unbelievable, really.
</p><p>The irony isn't lost on me: I can't stop getting email from Firefox because I'm not getting the verification email from Firefox. I see the dark humor, but this is a problem that needs to be resolved. I don't know where else to turn for help, so hoping someone here can provide some guidance. The real ask here is not to just get off the mailing list (I could set up a filter to automatically delete it, though I shouldn't have to do that) but instead to be able to receive the email to verify my account or, barring that, get help changing the email address on the existing account to one that can actually receive the email, e.g. my Gmail account.

1282027,2020-03-14 16:21:18 -0800,2020-03-15T11:22:31Z,A Firefox update disabled/killed the Firefox on my Desktop... Twice.,"<p>I'm fed up with the lack of support from Firefox. This issue has been going on for three weeks.
The last Firefox update crashed TWICE!
When I opened a Google/Firefox, An Update window popped up. Since I normally let them download or whatever they do, I wasn't concerned. Then it showed an ""Error"". I didn't see an ""Error Code Number or Name"" as it disappeared quickly. I tried to open Firefox/Google. To my surprise, all I got was a Blank Window. I tried clicking on the ""Home Icon"". Nothing changed. I tried my Bookmarks. No affect. I WAS Signed In. I tried finding the Fictional ""Firefox Support"". I got nowhere. I would've Googled the issue, but I couldn't even use that. Nothing Worked.
I finely decided to download a NEW Firefox/Google. Once I did, it worked fine all day. 
The next day, I opened the newly Downloaded one. Again I was greeted by the Firefox ""Update"" It started, then showed an Error. 
Again, I tried to open Firefox/Google. I got the same blank page as before. I decided to Remove, ALL Firefox/Google. from my Computer. Then I download another New Firefox. I made ONE change. I stopped Firefox from Updating Automatically. 
Day three, I opened Firefox, I opened  normally... Almost. Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. If I let it Download, it may Crash again. I lost ALL of my Bookmarks too. I went to the Recommended Firefox Site to retrieve them... It was a LIE!
Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. I have NEVER missed an Update 
Let me guess what Firefox is going to say. That is IF they reply at all;
No one else reported this issue. ( And I have Ocean front property in Arizona).
Make sure your operating system is up to date. 
(I must be too stupid to keep my system up and maintain this Machine).
I should upgrade to the (The Digital Pile of...... that goes by the name) Windows 10, and (The Garbage called) Google Chrome.
(Why would I Downgrade to one System that didn't work when it was released, a Browser that was Garbage when it was offered the first time (In 2008), and they WON'T Fix? I'd be better off taking a hammer to my PC. and my own head).
</p><pre>Just a quick note. When I first signed up for Google (Prior to the 2008 Google Chrome fiasco.) my Gmail stopped working. I could receive Mail, but I couldn't Open, Read, Delete, or anything else. This lasted for Five Years. I tried getting Help. I never got a reply from anyone. Then it started working. No explanation from Google. 
</pre>
<p>Don't bother telling me ""Well... It is Free"".  It isn't.
