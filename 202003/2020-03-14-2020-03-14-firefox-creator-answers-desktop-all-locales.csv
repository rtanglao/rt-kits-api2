This is rather a request for advice than an issue report.
I' ve learned about the facebook container add-on and wanted to know if there is a need for it if someone was making sure to exclusively open <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a> in its own profile. 
Say you set up a profile(from about:profiles) namely ""BIg Brothers"" for notorious trackers like google, facebook , twitter etc so they can perpetually track each other with simple rules to observe like :
- Never open an external(shared) link 
- Never access any other website through that profile.
</p><p>Is there a particular feature the add-on is bringing up that the native interface is missing ? The other reason is add-ons are great but they tend to bloat the system impeding the browsing experience. I am the kind of guy who opens 7 concurrent tabs each running heavy js code so the lighter the better.

When I try to export, it just makes me open it in a picture program on my computer. I can't keep this sucker enabled as it seems Firefox doesn't want to save and apply it. I have gone all over the settings about light, dark, and other themes. Nothing should be causing this. Uninstalling the Firefox Colors, reinstalling it, and redoing the ENTIRE theme all over again has only resulted in it not being saved and me going through Firefox Colors every time just to get the theme I want.
