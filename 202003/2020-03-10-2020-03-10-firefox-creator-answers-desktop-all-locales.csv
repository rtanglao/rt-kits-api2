</p><p>I like to work with side-by-side Firefox windows, with one of the windows being far slimmer (horizontally) than the other. Since I updated to Firefox 74.0 today, I can't resize the windows as I like to do. I can resize them, but it's like there's a minimum fixed size to what I can resize it to and then it locks and doesn't go any slimmer from there (maybe so the browser controls don't overlap?). That fixed size is far too big for my use case, i.e. I absolutely need it slimmer. I'm not entirely sure if the previous Firefox version contained a fixed minimum size, but if it did, it was much smaller (it allowed controls to overlap, which wasn't a problem for me)
</p><p>Is there a setting that I can change in Firefox 74 so that I can make the windows as slim as I require again?

I went on line at the end of February early in the morning 3;30am say and I am getting ready to log into my facebook account and it is looking for me to prove my identity.  I pick the right people, the right posts and it tells me that I am wrong and that I have to send in my ID.  Now this is not the first time but before my ID was actually in my account.  This time it is no ware to be seen zero response from Facebook, so I look into my log ins and it turns out that I was logged into my account in another city and the email for me to get back into my account was a fake link.  It was a good think I take screen shots because if you look at my login information the city that had my account was not listed, the emails disappeared from my email account like it never happened.  I also think they got access to my laptop as I had passwords in my account that were only these long numbers for website info and if you went there was nothing. I did delete these as there were about 6 of them.  I am very security conscious so this is truly freaking me out.  I can't contact Facebook they just don't care and they hae zero way for you to contact them.  Thank you for listing to me.

I never log into youtube so restoring that session is the only way to get the algorithm to recommend the random junk I like to watch lol.

When maximizing a window I get a large white bar blocking the entire header-menu area of the browser. Have attempted cycling the browser through fullscreen with F11 and Dev mode with F12. Have completely restarted the browser in and out of SafeMode with the same issue present. Additionally I can interact with the webpage however I cannot interact with any of the menus in the white bar in fact I actually select the icons on the desktop behind the bar. My computer is setup with one 1080p monitor and one 1440p monitor; this bug only appears on the 1440p screen. Going to restart and see if that solves the issue however I wanted to make a note of this error as it appears to be recurring throughout the past few years. Last detail is I am running Windows 10 and all drivers are up to date. Pictures show the browser in maximized SafeMode and after restoring view the bottom pop-up desktop menu.

Often when I start it I am told that I need to wait to use my computer because firefox must update itself. Annoying, presumptuous, but expected. Cut to 30 min ago when I start up firefox to do a task on my computer and it of course does an update before opening. When it does open, none of my settings are there. No bookmarks, no passwords no toolbars or buttons.
What I do see is a page saying something about profiles and syncing and this new version of firefox which I don't need and don't want and if I had a choice would not have installed.
So instead of going on my pc and performing a simple task that takes about 90 seconds, I am stuck trying to either sort of this mess that has been dropped in my lap and sync my settings and hopefully be able to get back everything I can't access right now. Or I can go dig up the hardcopy of my usernames and passwords that I need to complete my work. Guess which one I'm going to choose.

When I look to see what it is that is keeping them writing, it is almost always Firefox ""profile cache2 entries""--even when I am not actively browsing. Is this really necessary?
One example: AppData/Local/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/s5pokyxp.default-1557535245311/cache2/entries/etc.  Any ideas?  Thanks.

</p><p>2. Beforehand if there were issues it would take a few seconds to load the tab, now it just instantly crashes.
</p><p>3. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing, clearing everything, turning off add-ons, and changing options and nothing has worked. At best, I've stopped it from crashing on launch and disabling add-ons.
</p><p>4. This issue does not happen on other browsers, nor has my computer shown any unusual behavior.
</p><p>5. It did not start immediately with the new update, which I got the 20th. It started occurring a week or so after.

- strong encryption of passwords and cache.

- workspaces and a portable version like an opera (there is plenty of room for this on the work panel) (portability and mobility are great)
- synchronization (I want to see the browser like you left it in another place, in another OS, on another PC, or after the portable version. If I consider it necessary to separate something, then this should be offered to be solved by synchronization settings, or workspaces)
