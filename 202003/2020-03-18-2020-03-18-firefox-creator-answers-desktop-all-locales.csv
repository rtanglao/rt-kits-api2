Device name has mysteriously changed...,"<p>Firefox is my preferred browser, and I have all my bookmarks etc synchronized between laptop and phone. I've just had to install Chrome (unwillingly!) on my laptop, and so I exported all my Firefox bookmarks across to Chrome so that I could also use them there if necessary. The problem now is that I cannot delete certain old and out-of-date bookmarks on Firefox. I just went into the Sync settings of Firefox and saw that my device name is now ¬Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÆ’Ã‚
I don't know how long it has been like this, but I suspect that the exportation to Chrome may have something to do with it. I have temporarily dis-activated the Sync function.
So two problems: how can I delete obsolete bookmarks in Firefox? And what has happened to my device?

Fix?","<p>As the question says. I updated my Mac (2018 MacBook Pro) to the most recent OS (Catalina), I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox like 6 times, cleared my trash and any and all Firefox files, and deleted all profiles, made a new default one, and then deleted that one when it still wouldn't start, and restarted my laptop more than once. I cannot seem to get it to start no matter what I do! I've tried every fix I can find online. Every time I try to launch Firefox, it appears in the dash for a second and immediately shuts down. Trying to start in Safe Mode doesn't work either. Firefox used to work, but then I force quit it *once* because I was quitting all applications I wasn't using. Now it won't work at all no matter what I do. How do I fix this?

I don't know if my question is kind of simple, but I've tried everything and I'm still having the problem that Firefox doesn't remember any of my accounts and its passwords. If I want to log in, the auto fill works, but every time I open WhatsApp Web, Youtube, Gmail and other tabs I have to log in again. At the images you can see that YouTube, for exaple, says it has my account saved, but when I open it I have to log in. Thank you!
Note: This just happens when I close Firefox, might I turn ""Save cookies after closing Firefox"" on?

Or, Firefox doesn't recognize the element as an &lt;a&gt; tag; however, 1) I checked and the site is using &lt;a&gt; tags and 2) the same behavior is observed in Chrome. I can't figure out how the site is doing this. Any ideas on how the site is disabling the status panel and how to prevent the site from doing so?
</p><p>Repro steps:
1. Create a free account on Quip (<a href=""https://quip.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://quip.com/</a>)
2. Create a new document
3. Paste a url into the document and press enter
4. Hover over the url with the cursor
</p><p>Expected result:
The status panel is displayed with the url.
</p><p>Actual result:
The status panel is not displayed.
</p><p><br>
Note: Some links do result in the status panel being displayed, but as far as I can tell it's only links to other Quip pages, e.g. if you insert a link to a folder with @&lt;folder-name&gt;

</p><p>I never signed into their network, the computer is NOT Pepperdine's, has never been touched by their IT staff, and has nothing to do with them. Ever since my visit, any attempt to sign into a Google account via Firefox (and ONLY via Firefox) always takes my to that WiFI login page. I've tried going to ""<a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a>"", clicking the ""Sign-in"" button on the main Google search page, or navigating to ""<a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>"". Everything works perfectly fine on any other browser (Chrome, Edge), and I can get to gmail if I open it in a Private Window in Firefox. I've tried:
</p><p>1) setting network.dnsCacheExpiration to ""0"", 
2) I've rebooted the PC and restarted Firebox many times (and I was in Pepperdine over 2 weeks ago). 
3) I've nuked all cookies for both Pepperdine and Google. 
4) nslookup indicates that the correct IP is returned form the expected DNS server if i do a lookup manually. 
5) There is nothing interesting in the hosts file in Windows.

Click on ""+"" sign next to the last open tab simply produces no reaction, and the same is with ""Open Link in the New Tab"" command from the right-click menu. When restarted, problem disappears, just to reoccur a few minutes latter. This has started to happen about a month ago, all of the sudden. Has anyone experienced something similar? I'm on Win7, using the latest version of Firefox. I have tried to start Firefox with all the plug-ins disabled - nothing has changed. Thanks in advance!
