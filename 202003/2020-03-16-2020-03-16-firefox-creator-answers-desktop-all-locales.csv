So I uninstalled FDE and then re-downloaded it, reinstalled 75.0 since I do believe that the update to 75.0 had hung up on this particular device a week before. So then a day later my other two devices started having issues, so I tried to sign into another Firefox account, that didn't work so I did a reinstall and it seemed fine for a minute until I realized all my passwords/logins/history were gone, so I tried to sync again and then it gave me the message to set my oligarch password, so I tried and kept getting the 'Cannot change oligarch password' error. I have reinstalled twice and create a new Firefox account, tried to sign into an older one. I know someone will say just use the regular Firefox, but I use the FDE because my other Firefox browser is set with a work account that I keep to backup user data at work and I cannot use for my personal device.

</p><p>As the title suggests, none of the images on websites are shown after the 74.0 update. I have tried disabling all add-ons, started in safe mode and the images are still not displaying. I have also found that FF is now using 90% of my i9 and a lot of the sites are in perpetual loading mode. I've tried installing an older version and everything's fine, but after updating to 74, the same issue. The other web browsers are displaying images just fine.

Once again, the developers who believe themselves to be gods do not think users should be allowed to set Firefox to allow Flash on specific sites without asking EVERY SESSION, somehow believing that inconveniencing the users is somehow going to force website admins to move away from Flash before the announced deprecation at the END of the year.
</p><p>Now one of my daily-visited sites (the one for Daily Jumble) will not wait for me to enable Flash, and when I do enable it I then have to refresh the page to make it work.  It is obvious that if what I have been asking for all along -- being able to tell Firefox to enable Flash always FOR THIS SITE ONLY -- would alleviate the problem, but since the gods cannot see through the eyes of the users, I am now further inconvenienced by their decision.
</p><p>I maintain that they moved too quickly and too drastically to implement this change, and I have no reason to believe posting this will make any difference, but I again want them to know that instead of Firefox being the most user-friendly browser in the world (as it USED to be) it now has enough user-UNfriendliness to be as despised as Internet Explorer was.
</p><p>I do not believe it to be an unreasonable request to allow this, because they could simply put that functionality in, then take it out along with all Flash support in the first release of 2021.  But they think they know better.  Sorry, guys, but you DO NOT.

I don't actually 'know' CSS but searching has found the code to copy into my userChrome.css and then edit the colour values for almost everything. I've changed the toolbar, tabs toolbar, url bar, bookmark bar, menus, context menus, everything I wanted ... except one thing. The background colour of the active tab (just the actual tab in the tabs bar) is stubbornly staying the colour it gets from the Mozilla Dark theme, and I want to change it to the (slightly different) shade of grey that I've changed the toolbar to. Can somebody please tell me what the lines are to put in userChrome.css to change the background colour of the active tab? Thanks.

i use this link dragging almost everyday, dragging the lock symbol from the url entry line to a folder in my file browser. this always worked and stopped since updating firefox to 74.0.
</p><p>now the really weird stuff:
when i drag the link to a explorer window (i mean the windows file browser), it works.
when i drag a link first to explorer and then the same link from firefox to total commander it works.
when i drag a link that i never dragged to explorer to total commander, firefox UI becomes inresponsive, downloads hang, i can't change tabs or even click the close-windows-x. i can only quit firefox by right-clicking its icon in the windows task bar and select quit firefox there. even more interesting: when firefox is then quit, the .url file has been successfully created in the folder where i dragged it. also on resuming firefox, all tabs are successfully restored to where i just left it.
</p><p>summary: my work flow: i drag a link using the lock icon in firefox to my file browser to store the url in a "".url"" file. explorer works. total command not. this bug probably got introduced in firefox 74 (i didn't update total commander recently).
</p><p>i hope you can reproduce this bug (total commander is free for testing at <a href=""https://www.ghisler.com/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ghisler.com/index.htm</a> ). it might not hit many users, but it hits me several times per day.

</p><p>I also have pages that were the current page before Firefox was relunched, that don't load at all, but they have addresses in the navigation bar.  If I relaunch the browser again, sometimes the page comes back.  However, If I try to refresh the page before relaunching the browser, the address disappears, the page cannot be recovered, and is not listed in history.
</p><p>Also, I have random addons that have been reset to default at different times.  I thought it was my imagination at first.  That I must have forgotten to customize them, but it keeps happening, so far to at least 6 different addons.  The time period is hard to gauge because I don't notice until I see things no working right.
