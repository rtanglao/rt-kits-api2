Next, I found the places.sqlite file will update automatically without shutting down Firefox (most likely when the computer is put to sleep and then awakened). A warning about this little known file updating would be helpful to those who learned about their lost history, but choose to wait until later, like recovering it prior to shutting down, but they will have lost the opportunity when the places.sqlite file self updates itself automatically (who knows exactly when or why)  I'd like to see this important information placed your answer on this same (above) troubleshooting page, because when I loose history caused by a proper shut down, I'll need to your page infor to remind me what to be cautious about. And I don't believe you have created a back up file to places.sqlite to which I can recover and rename yet, because I believe the closest name to it has very little memory in it, but I could be wrong.

The way that New Window is inherently clumped together with the Homepage seems to make it impossible to separate the two in the Options settings. 
</p><p>What is the logic behind this? Why have a separate setting for New Tab, but not New Window? I like having Firefox open up multiple tabs as my homepage when I first boot up Firefox, but if I want to open up a new window just for screen management space with Ctrl+N, I really am not interested in my homepages being re-instantiated, as I already have them open on my first window. 
</p><p>I really want my Homepages to remain a custom mix of tabs with any New Tab and New Window opening up to a Firefox's default new tab page. Is that not possible? I can't have a custom Homepage without also having a custom New Window configuration?Â :( 
</p><p>It just seems like an arbitrary distinction. What can I do to make this magical world of separate Homepage and New Window settings happen?

Ever since the latest Firefox upgrade I can't properly watch or listen to a YouTube video unless I just play one video in a single tab and do nothing else with my browser or computer, otherwise the video is choppy and crackles loudly in my speakers, it pauses, and crawls like my computer is out of memory resources. In fact, sometimes even watching a single YouTube video in a single tab with no other programs running or tabs open is problematic. Nothing on my computer has changed except Firefox; why can it no longer handle activity in multiple tabs or in conjunction with almost any other program running simultaneously? This was never an issue before and it's very agitating. Do I need to switch to another browsing platform to regain a smooth viewing experience?

After upgrading to an ethernet cable and getting much faster internet speeds (around 70mbps on the speed test), I've noticed that for whatever reason, Firefox is actually running slower than it did when I had worse internet connection through Wi-Fi signal. Websites can take minutes to fully load. When checking the task manager, it shows that Firefox's network speed is either 0.1mbps or 0mbps. This can be somewhat inconsistent, for example YouTube's homepage is able to load somewhat quickly, however videos can take a few refreshes. This is also sometimes a problem on a few other programs like Discord, but it's never been a problem on Edge (which is where I'm writing this). Is there any way to fix this?
