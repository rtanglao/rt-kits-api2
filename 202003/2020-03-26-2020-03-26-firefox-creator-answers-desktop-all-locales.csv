It has been momentarily freezing/lagging whenever I view 1080 HD Youtube videos, or whenever I view a graphics intensive site, or sometimes even random close out a tab. And when whenever I view Images in a tab, after the crash happens, some times the grey background behind said image is ALL black and when I zoom in and zoom out, there is still a zoom in image glitch behind the real image when it's zoomed out. </p><p>And now whenever I view a site, namely one that is on a <a href=""http://PJJ.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">PJJ.cc</a> server... A chatroom which I own seems to be glitching on Firefox and not on any other browser as far as I know. On the side panel, is supposed to have a background JPG which is a brick wallpaper, but it's all black... However, when I either shrink the browser, or switch over to another tab and back to that one, it appears loaded in. </p><p>I tried refreshing the browser, that didn't work. I tried uninstalling and doing a clean install... that didn't work either. </p><p>Can someone tell me WHAT is exactly going on and if this can be fixed, or if it will be fixed during the next update? </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;escalate;bug_1;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1300334;1300347;1300349;1300431;1300491;1300556;1300577;1300583;1300697;1300780;1300841;,Yautja_Theide

The reason BTW is that the failure to open at the extreme right makes tab management VERY difficult and I often have to remove tabs by closing them manually, rather than ""closing tabs to the right"".
