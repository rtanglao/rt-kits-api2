But some pages never stop trying, and it overheats my computer -- this can be happening on tabs that are not ""on top"" and I have no way of FINDING the problem. </p><p>In 2015 there existed an addon that would allow me to stop scripts on the open tab: <a href=""https://www.ghacks.net/2015/01/15/disallow-scripts-temporarily-on-web-pages-in-firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ghacks.net/2015/01/15/disallow-scripts-temporarily-on-web-pages-in-firefox/</a> </p><p>&gt; One of the best extensions to deal with scripts is the NoScript add-on for Firefox. While powerful, it is rather complex and difficult to get right after installation thanks to its default script blocking configuration and the need to distinguish between good and bad scripts. </p><p>Disallow Script Button is another Firefox add-on that you can use to turn off scripts temporarily on sites you visit in the browser. </p><p>It is useful in situations where you are stuck on a website, say one that loads popup after popup, or redirects you all the time around, or prevents you from leaving as you can hit the button it makes available to block all scripts running on it. &gt; </p>",firefox-680;desktop;fix-problems;mac-os;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1299736;,s1s1s11

I've looked up a few fixes before posting and they didn't work: </p><p>- Tried booting FF on safe mode and it didn't fix the issue - it clearly isn't caused by an add-on (and I've never had this issue in my previous browser with nearly the same add-ons installed). - other people seem to have had the exact same issue multiple times and it's lasted for years, so it's clearly a problem on FF's end. </p><p>Here is the issue described more specifically: Copying things from a tab from FF and into the online version of Word does not work - when I try to, the intended selection:  - disappears a few seconds after I've pasted - or it does not appear at all - or when it does, it erases the entire sentence it was pasted next to it, which you can imagine is absolutely bothersome. </p><p>I've also tried to copy/paste statistics from a site called <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org"" rel=""nofollow"">archiveofourown.org</a> onto another FF tab. - What ended up being copied is only the last character of the entire content I was trying to paste, which I think suggests there's some issue with what's contained in the clipboard. </p><p>I'm mentioning these two websites because I'm guessing that something about them is probably conflicting with the copy/paste feature, however I'm hoping no one will have the gall to tell me it's those websites' faults and that I should just stop using them. </p><p>When pasting (while having hopefully copied the former selected content- and no, it wasn't the case), it always pastes the content which was last copied into the clipboard prior to that very attempt, which shows that the clipboard's content was not refreshed with the last selected copied one. </p><p>I'm surprised to see that FF has had such a glaring issue for years and for many other users, and updates have never given a fix for it. I'd like this issue to be fixed properly, because I'd hate to have to switch back to my previous browser. FF sports so many nice features that other browsers don't have, and it'd be a shame to ruin the experience with a bug so basic as the copy/paste feature being broken. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1299677;1299705;,yumiifmb
