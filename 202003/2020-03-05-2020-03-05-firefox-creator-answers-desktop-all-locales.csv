</p><p>As you scroll down the page, the video positioned at the top of the page appears as a pop-up in the lower right of the screen and stays there as you scroll down.  This is annoying to me for several reasons.  First, it seems like every time there is a FireFox update, they change how you stop video autoplay.  So, many times when I scroll, that pop-up video starts playing and I don't want it to autoplay.  Second, many times I click on the ""X"" to close the thingie, scroll down some more, and, it pops up again - some times playing again.  Third, I seem to have no control of this type of thingie and I don't know what possible damage it can do to my computer.  And, yes, you will see this thingie on certain types of web sites where the semi-naked girl rolls up from the bottom, dances, and, then rolls away.
</p><p>I am a novice/intermediate web developer, so, I am familiar with what HTML and Javascript can do.  I use ADBlock Plus in Firefox, but, when I try to block that element, it doesn't seem to be able to identify it.  I am guessing that this type of thingie is a Javascript script, but, looking at the page's source code, I can't identify what is producing this effect.
</p><p>Other than calling it a generic ""pop-up"", does this type of thingie have a name (so that I can research further with Google)?  How is it generated?  How can I identify it in the source code?  What can I do to control, stop, or, block it?

Using the profile manager does not get any better results. I am also having problems with the home page, I have set a custom page but 73 often resets this to a blank page or sometimes the default home page.
I have had to resort to a 'portable' version as 73 constantly resetting things was getting so annoying but the portable does not work well as a default browser.

</p><p>I had to reset my PC tonight and forgot my password for my Firefox account, luckily I have a recovery key. My issue is when I reset my password, the field is missing to enter the key. 
</p><p>The recovery instructions state: 
</p><p>If you forgot your password and need to reset it, follow these steps.
</p><pre>  1. Click the Forgot your password? link on the sign in page.
  2.  Check your email and click the password reset link in it.
  3.  Enter recovery key.
  4.  Create a new password.
  5.  Create a new recovery key. 
</pre>
<p><br>
If I try to enter a new password will the recovery key option appear after? My fear is I would reset my account accidentally and unable to revert afterwards.

All the other questions I've found about this are from 2013 or earlier.

</p><p>I've recently installed version 73.01 of FF and have been trying to import all my Chrome data into it. The online instructions are using an old UI, and I cannot find ""Import"" under any bookmarks pop out menu or toolbar. I have tried searching setting for ""Import"" to no avail. Has import been removed with this version or am I looking in the wrong spot?

Once restarted, I tried to open Firefox a pop-up claimed the profile was missing or inaccessible, but I could find it easily in its normal place.

It appeared to have worked as they were staying put. I closed the browser to do some other tasks and when I reopened the browser again everything was back to its chaotic state as if I hadn't touched it. This started on its own a few days ago and I need it to stop immediately as its driving me nuts not being able to quickly find the ones i need and use regularly. Please help!
