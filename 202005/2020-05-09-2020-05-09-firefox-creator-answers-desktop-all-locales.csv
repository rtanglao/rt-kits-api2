For now I've disconnected both, after also unchecking bookmarks from the sync in both etc. But I still want to get my bookmarks onto my phone from my PC, and I've read sync is how you do that. And this attempt did not sync any bookmarks onto android. </p><p>Edit: tried again the next day, signed in on PC first and then on android, with only bookmarks checked under sync options on both devices. This time it did work, and my PC bookmarks are all on android under ""Desktop bookmarks"". So that's cool. </p><p>Since my first try yesterday I had deleted my few default android bookmarks so that that one was empty. And I backed up and restored my PC bookmarks and tried a couple things. So this time around I don't currently have any ""mobile bookmarks"" folder on PC. I've added a couple bookmarks and subfolders on the mobile bookmarks on Android, hasn't popped up on PC yet. </p><p>Also a minor note, for some reason the ""bookmarks menu"" part was minimized after I first tried syncing, so for a bit I thought my bookmarks just weren't showing in the ""all bookmarks"" menu. So that wasn't an issue. </p><p>Anyways, still figuring out a couple things on the android side, folders etc. How they work differently than on PC. On PC you can have folders mixed in with bookmarks, but on android all subfolders appear at the top of a folder, instead of interspersed the way I placed them on PC. So that can mess with organization for me. And stuff like that. But mostly it's sorted out. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-7601;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1311743;1312093;,groovyxo21

Do note that my second question has NOT received A SINGLE REPLY from anybody. I have now updated to version 72 and then subsequently to version 76.0.1 (which the latest one at the time of writing this question. I am still suffering from the same problem of stuttering 1080p 60fps YouTube videos due to frame drops, <strong>especially using the VP9 codec</strong>, although other codecs also drop a few frames. Do note that the audio works just fine in real-time without any lag, and this problem exists ONLY for 1080p @ 60 fps, not for any other resolution or frame rate. I have referred to the following links to try and solve my problem:- </p> <ol><li> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8qhbhg/h264_1080p_60fps_stutter_youtube_vimeo_etc/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8qhbhg/h264_1080p_60fps_stutter_youtube_vimeo_etc/</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277519"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277519</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0.2/releasenotes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0.2/releasenotes/</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608485"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608485</a> </li></ol> <p>The Firefox version 72.0.2 release notes categorically state that the issue has been resolved and even points to the bugzilla page for the same. But it still exists even in version 76.0.1, which is surprising. I have tried every possible combination I can think of, from setting <em>media.media-capabilities.enabled</em> = <strong>false</strong> in <strong>about:config</strong> to disabling specific codecs and hardware acceleration, none of which solved the issue permanently to my satisfaction. A few settings, at times, improved the issue slightly but there was no permanent solution, even though this has been alluded to in a previous release note. Do note that my graphics drivers are updated and this issue is Firefox-specific, i.e other browsers work just fine. Even the older versions of Firefox work fine, as stated earlier. I would like to state that I prefer using the VP9 codec because other codecs take a toll on my relatively low-bandwidth network connection and this leads to longer buffering times (VP9 does not have this problem). I humbly request the community members and volunteers to help me in this regard, <strong>and if need be, point me to the proper channel for lodging a bug report directly to Mozilla</strong>.  </p><p>Thanks and regards,<br> Preetodeep Dev. </p><p><em>P.S:-</em> If this issue is not resolved, then I will have<strong> no choice but to go back to Firefox version 62.0.2</strong>, which works just fine with all the default settings. </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",preetodeepdev
