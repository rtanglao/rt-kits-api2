I get nervous when I read this paragraph below.  I stay away of storing anything on the cloud, only on my computer do I want passwords stored.  Actually, I have Lockwise disabled for now, only because I have to enter oligarch password everytime I want to view a sites password.   I like the old way where I enter oligarch password once and can view all site passwords and better manage.  Other than that Lockwise looks fine, thought about reverting to it, but this breached password checking raised a red flag.   I know I can turn it off.   </p><p>Starting in Firefox version 76, Firefox will also check to see if you’ve reused  any of these potentially vulnerable passwords with other logins you’ve saved to Lockwise. The browser does this by creating an encrypted list of your breached passwords, then checking it against all saved passwords. Firefox does not keep logs of your plaintext passwords or know them. </p>",firefox-750;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1311007;,diverjer
