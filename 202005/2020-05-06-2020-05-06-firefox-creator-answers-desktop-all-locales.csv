Navigate to the “Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/” or “Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles” folders inside your user folder. You will find a folder named “Bookmarkbackups” inside a profile folder with a random name. Copy the most recent “.json” file from the folder to your external hard drive and use the “Restore” option in the Import and Backup menu to import it on the other Mac."" But, unfortunately, both in my new Mac and in the TimeMachine backup the mentioned pathnames are missing. Under the ""Library-Mozilla"" folder there is only a file named global.regs. Under the ""Library-Application Support"" there isn't any ""Firefox"" folder, only a ""Mozilla"" folder containing another folder named ""Extensions"" (having 3 subfolders, all of them apparently empty) Someone can help me to find and replace my profile?
