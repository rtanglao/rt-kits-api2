I had never saved explicitly my bookmarks so I do not have any html or other kinds of backup files. From the TimeMachine backup I have, I would like to get out my previous Firefox profile and put it in the right place on the new Mac. I found these instructions, that seem exactly what I need: ""You can also copy Firefoxâs bookmarks from its profile folder, if you cannot open Firefox on the old Mac or just have access to backups. Navigate to the âLibrary/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/â or âLibrary/Application Support/Firefox/Profilesâ folders inside your user folder. You will find a folder named âBookmarkbackupsâ inside a profile folder with a random name. Copy the most recent â.jsonâ file from the folder to your external hard drive and use the âRestoreâ option in the Import and Backup menu to import it on the other Mac."" But, unfortunately, both in my new Mac and in the TimeMachine backup the mentioned pathnames are missing. Under the ""Library-Mozilla"" folder there is only a file named global.regs. Under the ""Library-Application Support"" there isn't any ""Firefox"" folder, only a ""Mozilla"" folder containing another folder named ""Extensions"" (having 3 subfolders, all of them apparently empty) Someone can help me to find and replace my profile?
