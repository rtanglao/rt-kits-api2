Threat model: one of my extensions gets a rogue update and puts up a screen that looks just like a screen (e.g., the login page) of another extension (e.g., my password manager). When the extension name is too long, Firefox currently displays:  Extension... <last word of extension name> To be secure I currently need to click on the above so that it expands, in order to verify it's the correct extension. Can this be done in CSS, or would a feature change be needed to Firefox? ",firefox-680;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,en-US

I had a pop-up to set up onedrive and it sounded like a good idea since I am not sure my backups are working.  Now html files won't open in firefox at all.  I can right click the html file and open with Chrome, view the source, but have to manually select all, copy and return to FF to finish updating my website.  I believe this may be a Microsoft issue.  I wondered if there was some solution to do this on FF.  My next consideration would be to uninstall OneDrive, but don't know the ramifications to other applications.  The path for files got all messed up when I installed OneDrive.  I want my life back.  I have spent hours on trying to find a solution.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
