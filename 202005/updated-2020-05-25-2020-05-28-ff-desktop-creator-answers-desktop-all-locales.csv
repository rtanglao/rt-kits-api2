Usually with other apps you can bring the program to the correct monitor and close it there then it opens there as well. I move FF around from time to time but my main monitor gets the most use. To test this weird issue, I moved FF to the second monitor and tried printing there, the dialog shows up on my main LOL. What causes the print dialog to show up on the wrong screen, or even why does it always choose another screen other than the one FF is being displayed on? Is there a setting or option to correct this? The reason this is problematic is I don't always turn on the second on, so if i want to print a receipt or something I have to turn on the second monitor(which for me takes a bit, first the main blanks out then second turns on then first ""catches up"").
