Can this be fixed?,<p>I purchased a Dell computer for Windows 10 and just got a Dell monitor.  The computer has no DP port and I had to use the VGA cable.  But internet using Firefox just doesn't work well because some pages (especially FaceBook and Gmail) don't appear like they did on the old monitor that used VGA.  I'm wondering if there might be some kind of fix in Firefox.  Since I'm in my 80s and not a computer geek I hesitate going through all the steps advised to find a fix that may not exist.  Thanks so much for any help - even if it's to let me know that no such fix exists.  Also - I tried to take a screenshot of Facebook and a blank page comes up.   And everything is fine when I use Windows Explorer.  Jacquie Never mind - I think I fixed it to my satisfaction on my own.

I would like to merge them all without losing any data, but I don't want to just blindly create a mess.  </p><p>So what happens when I log into same Firefox account across these devices?

I logged into my FF account and everything synced, bookmarks, add-ons, etc. But every time I restart the browser, even after a couple of seconds, my Matte Black theme changes to a theme that I have NEVER applied, made, nor even seen in the theme catalog, even on my previous Ubuntu installation. I tried running FF in Safe Mode and ""Refreshed Firefox"" but the problem occurs after a minute or two after starting the browser afterwards and the theme changes again. I deleted the profile .js file for a new file to be created, but that does not work. It's as if the Sync didn't sync the new changes made to the browser. </p>",firefox-7601;customize;desktop;firefox-760;linux;,firefox,customize,en-US,1312623;,live.by.moment.813

A couple months ago my Firefox started to behave a little weird on opening new windows. At work I have to use our Ticket-System. When there is a Ticket I have to open it by double clicking. The window will open in a new window. This window always gets a weird position on my second screen and it looks like it would be zoomed, but it isn't. Here a Screenshot (left = MacBook, right = external 4K Monitor). I have a the same behavior when working in our CMS. </p><p>What I did for troubleshooting: </p> <ol><li> Command + 0 to make sure it's really not zoomed (btw. if it would be zoomed there would be a % mark right to the URL). </li><li> Close all windows and restart Firefox </li></ol> <p>Based on <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172141"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172141</a> </p> <ol><li> I deleted xulstore.json </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings</a> </li><li> finally I create a new clean profile and completely deleted the old one </li></ol> <p>None of the above changed the behavior. I have no clue what to do. Any ideas/help is appreciated.
