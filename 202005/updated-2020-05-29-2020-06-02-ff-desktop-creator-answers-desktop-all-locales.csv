(I've searched the web several times for articles to help, too).  </p><p>I'm having a problem with emails coming to my Comcast/Xfinity email from <a href=""http://zillow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zillow.com</a>. I can open the email, but if I click on a link inside for a property for sale, the content gets blocked by Firefox. Additionally, the email then stops me from further navigating to my other emails, repeatedly, even after I delete the email, coming up no matter which other email I select to open. I can only view my other email by closing the email program and restarting my email program again.  </p><p>I've cleared my Zillow cookies cache as was suggested as a solution by an archived question, but that also did nothing.

I just had an immediate reply with a phone number to call to help with my question. I called, and no answer. I was immediately  called back from a completely unrelated phone number by a fellow who said he was both Goggle and Firefox support. This raised my concern level, but after asking about the different phone numbers, if there was a charge, etc., I told him my problem, which was exactly as stated here, so no secret. He wanted to gain remote access to my computer to take a look at the problem, and I declined. I've done that before with support services I have called with no problems (note *I* called them), but this felt questionable. He even offered to call back from the number I had called in the effort to prove he was who he said he was. I declined and hung up. Maybe my B.S. detector is set too high, but no thanks. If Firefox routinely does this it does not engender confidence. He called me again twice while I was typing this.

History problem),"<p>Hi. </p><p>I love Firefox specifically because it lets me use Ctrl+Shift+N, i.e. reopen a closed window. I have this one window with several pinned tabs (Facebook etc.) and a few other open tabs (some reseach, YouTube etc.) where I keep things that I need to return to. I essentially NEVER close this window without reopening it, because it has the most important things I need. Sometimes I open a second/third window to work in (I had an online exam the other day, so I opened that and my materials in a separate window, so I can cycle through them more easily). </p><p>When I open this second window, sometimes I close my main window (it has quite a few tabs so it slows Firefox down). I then always reopen it using Ctrl+Shift+N and never had a problem. Well, I closed it now (then opened one or two other new windows), but when I wanted to reopen my main window back up, it just refused to. It's gone from ""recently closed windows"". Interestingly enough, at least two other windows I closed BEFORE it (one from yesterday, that I did unrelated googling in; the other was closed a couple minutes before the main window, it was an emoticon set that pops up from one forum) were possible to reopen, but not my main window. Now I can reopen just 3 windows, and I don't understand where they are (there used to be up to ~10 or so).  </p><p>I want to know why I was able to reopen windows I closed long ago, but not the most recent one, and whether there is a way to fix this and get the main window back. I have effectively lost ~40 tabs that I had open (some research articles, pinned social media, some stuff I wanted to read etc.) that I can't even reopen unless I find them through my History (and hoo boy, that'd take a while). </p><p>Thanks for any info. Have a nice day. </p><p><br> SOLVED - EDIT: The amount of windows that can be reopened can be fixed as mentioned below. Lost window probably cannot be restored, sadly. EDIT 2: Actually it can be restored! See the answer to find out how.

I was a graphic artist for decades, and it makes no sense to have the tabs all the way at the top, because your eye has to jump up to the top, away from the window itself, every time you want to move between tabs. It makes no sense, but so far Firefox has ignored these complaints (I'm not the only one) and has not offered a simple toggle in preferences or somewhere to move the tabs where they should IMO be. </p><p>I seem to have lost the instructions to do my own coding to move the damn things, and I would really appreciate if someone could tell me how I can move them back where they belong.

However I Note there is something seriously missing here from a usability point in the Browser caused by lack of settings in the Home Section. </p><p>In Firefox, Options, Home Section you have only 2 choices  a Section Called ""Home Page and New Windows"" and ""New Tabs"" this is the area that needs to be fixed and here is why. </p><p>The Choices in the Home Section, New Windows and Tabs should have a 3rd New Option added called Simply ""Startup Pages"". The new Home Section would have 3 options as listed below. </p><p>""Home Page"" (an option to input a Single URL) ""New Windows and Tabs"" (again an option to input Single URL or an option for a Radio Button to ""Use Home Page Settings"" A new One Called ""Startup Pages"" ( An option for user to put in a Single URL or Mutliple URL's seperated by a PIPE simple for Multiple Pages. This new Option called Startup Pages should only load When you Start Firefox by clicking on the Desktop Firefox ICON of the ICON for the Firefox Program) </p><pre>Case In Point. When I startup Firefox I want to have it open Multiple Pages so I have what I need, this saves me time and avoids me opening what I want loaded EVERY TIME I use Firefox. You give us that option currently in a setting called ""Home Page and New Windows"" However you also use this when a user clicks on the Home ICON on the toolbar or open a New Window. </pre> <p>I and others do not want multiple pages to load each time I select the Home ICON as they are already open and most users want those STARTUP Pages to remain Open while they Browse. I also do not want my Multiple Pages to Open when I select a new WINDOW or new TAB. in the current setup you can quickly have the same pages open many many times based on the current interface options in the Home Section. </p><p>When a user wants to open Multiple Pages at Startup, they Most Generally do not want their multiple pages set in Firefox Options, Home, Home and New Windows to reopen when you want a simple NEW Window or Select the Home Page ICON. Most Users, myself included, want only a single web page to open when selecting the Home Icon in the Toolbar or When Selecting to Open a New Window, and generally users want it to be a Search Engine Page or Firefox Default Web Page. The new Microsoft Edge Browser also has issues with this type of operation and omits settings to accomplish my request.  </p><p>Unfortunately GOOGLE CHROME does have options to achieve the Settings Separately and they have settings for Show Home Button, which let's you set a URL or New Tab Page, if New Tab Page is selected it simply Opens Up the Google Search page, Startup Page(s). They also have an Option and settings for On Startup where you can set a single page or Multiple pages. In Google Chrome if you want to open a new Window it simply opens the Google Chrome Search Page.  </p><p>In closing I really like the new Firefox, You have done a Great Job and it is Light Years better than the New Edge Browser or Google Chrome, however to make it Really Rock and BEST IN CLASS for Operations I am hoping you can make changes to the Firefox Options, Home section to allow a more flexible and sensible operation of the Firefox Browser for Home, New Window or Tab and Startup, this would be Awesome and I do not think it would be a Major Change in the Code by adjust the Home Settings and adding a new Option </p><p>Thank you for Consideration of this Feature Request, please keep up the Great Work. </p>",customize;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1317426;,brent.ruggles

Pinholes make p.poor peepholes.  You have no idea the rage such stupidity can generate in such a mild guy as I (I actually am, but I have limited tolerance with stupidity).  That means others will be even less pleased and you'll  miss seeing the large astronomical body heading for your head. First, let me clue you in that e-mails sent via FF. aren't as wide on the right as e-mails sent via M.S.  It took years for me to realize that that was the reason why certain e-mails to the VA weren't working!   In all other matters I was happily using ver. 75 (?) for many, many years.  Then, through a less than clear process, I ended up with version 76!  Trying to ape the ""cool"" crowd is usually NOT a good idea!  Stick with building an easy to use and solidly better product that works.  Forego the flim-flam ""cool"" crap of your competitor and people will beat a highway to your door!  Which brings me back to v. 76..... After considerable effort it finally was beginning to show some promise, but trying to make adjustments, starting with the tiny, tiny print was becoming an exercise in frustration, fury and futility!  Who in your organization is stupid enough to think this is OK?  I suggest you collect their belongings immediately and escort them to the door!  I was trying to customize that work (v. 76) in progress, but ........ I give up!  There's no useful assistance info either, not even something a masochist would grudgingly use!  I'd be happy to be able to return/revert to v. 75. Just show me the way.  I can even learn to live with the level of 'ads' in e-mails that v. 75 has.   This was the original poison in the well, and they weren't winning.   So, it's up to you.  I detested µSoft from their beginnings in chicanery and still do, but if I have to deal with that cesspool, I'll just get a bigger nasal clip and do the best I can. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1317273;,bytedog1

1288885,2020-05-29 21:47:35 -0800,2020-05-30 15:03:52 -0800,Once again... Updating to new FF r76.01) crapped all over my settings and tossed my add-ons.,"<p>How do I go about restoring ALL of the settings I had in FF r76 or whatever was current ten days ago? Settings includes add-ons that were installed as well as whether or not they were enabled as well as the individual settings for each add-on. </p><p>In other words, I would truly like to avoid updating Firefox unless I have at least a couple of days to waste.  When I used to have things set so I would merely be informed when a new FF update is available whenever I start or restart FF, it seemed that FF was so unhappy with me not paying attention to it that it would cause problems with other applications or system utilities. </p><p>I have no reason why something caused FF to break other things just because I might have decided not to update it more than once a week.  I cannot see how any new release short of Ff r68 (or whatever the point of no return with Quantum was) or a bug fix of epic proportions that I should be eagerly awaiting should mess things up if I decide not to bother with it immediately. </p><p>The deleted add-ons and strange new settings/configuration situations caused by FF upgrades could be easily remedied without causing users much if any stress if they had an option to make a full backup of the current FF installation with all installed add-ons (active or not), settings, etc. to a user-specified directory and filename. </p><p>That way, users could always revert back a release or three if they found something horribly wrong with the latest update that they did not notice in the previous recent update(s). </p><p>What would make things much easier for me and many others I am sure would be upgrades that changed no user custom configurations back to some defaults that render the UI almost unrecognizable and initially useless without a lot of restoration work.   For example, why do the text menus I often use keep going away after updates occur?  Why do I have to avoid following links to what might be interesting Web sites because all the the security and privacy enhancement add-ons I trust and know how to use from long experience have gone missing? </p><p>For me, a Web browser is the home of my UI to the Web and most of the tools, accessories, and links I find most useful on the Web.  Essentially, the way I have FF set up by choice makes it my own personalized Web portal because even the Google Search page became too cluttered with announcements, disclaimers, and other distractions, when a simple Web query tool with an option for more advance queries was all I wanted. </p><p>Is there a way that I can quickly make this release of FF (r76.01) look, act, and function the same as the previous release did tend days ago?  I mean I should not notice anything different now that I cannot adjust or bypass so that I only have to worry about important changes, such as enforcement of HTTPS:-only which I was doing with an EFF add-on long before it was built into FF. </p><p>Using the above analogy, would most FF users who deal with landlords, property management, or HOAs be thrilled if every time they came home from work they found the landscaping had changed, new interior decorations applied in every room, and their favorite comfortable furniture not where they left it, but it moved to different locations that do not fit well with their usual household routines (or maybe just thrown out entirely)? </p><p>I have nothing against meaningful changes to improve functionality, performance, or appearance; but having those changes made in one's carefully configured environment for use in conjunction with the Web for no important reason and without the ability to undo the majority of what has changed in ten minutes (maybe an hour for alterations necessitated by the Web itself changes suddenly at times of, oh say, the worst pandemic since before the first nodes on what is now known as the Internet were linked and communications established between them? </p><p>I would be thrilled if my list of installed add-ons (enabled or not) never changed unless there were some that truly would not work because of some necessary part of an browser upgrade.  Ditto for the way I like text menus and dislike icons or entirely missing menus for about the same reason I dislike trying to make sense of Chinese road and building signage circa 1860. </p><p>I doubt I will bother to gripe about difficult to (mostly) repair Firefox upgrades a third time a few months from now, because the hassles they cause will probably be more irritating to me than caving in like most sheople and using some Chrome variant browser. </p><p>Really, I would like to know how to get as close to what I had in Firefox about ten days ago, excepting only absolutely necessary differences.  It would be miraculous if I could repair the look, feel, and functionality that was lost in the upgrade to FF r76.01, especially if I could do the work in less time than it takes most people reading this rant to figure out that I do not enjoy proofreading, especially when there are riots in the streets in many U.S. cities, live on TV ... just what we need during an economic crisis caused by an ongoing pandemic. </p><p>Regards, Mark (thinking of browsers, cars, home machinery, entertainment gear with standardized UIs, appliance-style) </p>",download-and-install_1;desktop;firefox-760;windows-81;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1317319;,tmarkgibson
