You can <a href=""https://www.grc.com/ssl/ev.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">read this for more details on why this matters a great deal</a> read this for more details on why this matters a great deal. When I click on the gray padlock, I get a simple pop-up that doesn't display the legal company/org name or location of the web site! But it does show a gray padlock, green text ""Connection Secure"", and a clickable right-arrow. I then click on ""more information"", then ""View Certificate"" to finally get org details...but I still have no idea if this is an EV certificate! The only clue may be the detail ""Extended Key Usages"" ""Purposes: Server Authentication, Client Authentication"". I want to conclude that this means this is an EV certificate, but I am unable to find any documentation from Firefox/Mozilla that proves that this is an EV certificate. I suppose I could phone the organization and manually verify their details vs. what it says on the certificate, but this is a lot of work! Worse, for large organizations that go by different names and addresses, it could be a legit connection to the org's Web server, but what they tell me on the phone still might not match what the certificate says. </p><p><strong>Can anybody shed light on this?
