Using Win10/FF76, with NoScript 11.0.25 (&amp; previous).   NoScript is only extension.    </p><p>Since AmEx redesigned their website several (many?) months ago, I've had increasing issues using Firefox to log-on the site via their (bookmarked) new log-in page (a bookmarked link to their old log-on page still works, as do all my other banking/financial sites, as well as 98% of other sites).   Log-on button reacts when clicked, but no action - doesn't seem to run its script.   Initially, allowing permissions multiple cycles using NoScript (as is typical for some sites, as scripts load) was sufficient (I try to reduce scripts to minimum necessary, always excluding Facebook scripts).   Logging on via link from AmEx home page sometimes worked slightly better.   However, internal site functions seemed to need multiple refreshes on load.   Within the last two months, only completely disabling NoScript for AmEx tab worked.  Today, not even disabling or uninstalling NoScript completely worked.   In addition, today cannot log-out of AmEx site without multiple (~10x) clicks on the log-out button (webpage seems to gradually close down functionality with each click and twirl of the script indicator, similar to functionality loading issue previously noted). </p><p>Clearing all cache and cookies (per FF forum help) works one time - log-on can be accomplished with two attempts, but log-out continues problematic.  Subsequent log-ons problematic. </p><p>As before, problem repeated on other computers (today, two other computers using Win10/FF76; one with a new Win10 and FF install w/o NS). </p><p>Previously, other browsers unaffected (Old MS Edge, Opera).   Today, using MS Chrome Edge, AmEx site worked without problem.  However, noted that AmEx log-on page loaded with Edge was old-style (that still works with FF, also), not new.   All SSL certs (FF and Edge) verified. </p><p>AmEx doesn't have any link to their Web Support - I guess I have to write them a letter..  Suspect it's a problem on their end, not FF, but have run into several sites lately where FF either doesn't run well, or is specifically not supported.   Don't want to give up privacy features and independence of FF, but would like some ammo to hit AmEx with, if it's indeed an engineered problem with their site. </p>",websites;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;amex;webcompat;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",co_gringo

Because of this, i would think that if the structure of FireFox would allow, someone would probably by now have created a compatible version. This leads me to think there must be some aspects that can be handled by an extension, and some that can not due to internal coding. </p><p>I can't understand why the FireFox development team wouldn't work with the community to provide those Tab Mix Plus enhancements to the internal coding that no longer can be created by an extension. It would seem like the competitive thing to do, so i must believe that there either is a real security reason, or simply the old extension was not as popular as i think it was. </p><p>I'm afraid i must admit that it has been so long that there are probably many alternative replacements to the Tab Mix Plus features that i don't recall, yet i really did prefer a setting to open links in a new tab rather than having to hold down Ctrl at the same time of clicking - i know it seems picayune, but it still is a preference! </p><p>I only mess around with VBA, so please use the ""big print and pictures"" method of explanation :) </p><p>Thank-you for your thought! </p>",firefox-750;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",brucemc777

I'm running Firefox (version 75.0, auto-updates enabled) on a Windows 10  (Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362) desktop PC. I'm using the built-in Firefox password manager, although as a general practice I do not log into it using my master password unless absolutely needed (for example, to check my email or Slack). For the vast majority of the general browsing I do, I stay logged out of my accounts. </p><p>This has worked just fine for years. However, lately Firefox keeps prompting me to enter my master password, and won't stop prompting me for my password while I'm browsing. Oftentimes I'll randomly receive the prompt, often on sites that should not be asking for a password, such as a blank New Tab or sites that don't have any associated data in my password manager. </p><p>What's frustrating is that, when I close the prompt, Firefox will immediately re-prompt me again to enter my master password, despite me not wanting to log in (or on some sites, not having an account or even a login page). It will keep repeating this prompt incessantly, sometimes for 5-6 times before going away briefly, only to reoccur when I navigate to a new site.  </p><p>My browser is configured to be a bit more privacy-conscious, and I'm wondering if this may be causing this behavior. In Options &gt; Privacy and Security, I've set Custom blocking for the following items: - Cookies (all third-party sites) - Tracking content (in all windows) - Cryptominers - Fingerprinters I have also set my browser to delete cookies and site data upon closure.  </p><p>I am using the following plugins, with auto-updates enabled: uBlock Origin HTTPS Everywhere Privacy Badger Decentraleyes Cookie Autodelete Firefox Mult-Account Containers Facebook Container </p><p>I've searched the support forums for help on this topic and found the two articles below. However, after trying the offered solutions, neither fixed the underlying behavior. Also note that I am not using any third-party antivirus solutions, like ESET Internet Security and Avast, which have been known to cause similar issues with the Firefox password manager. Here are the articles I found: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-master-password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-master-password</a> (I tried these steps and still had the same behavior happen) <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785</a> (this just disables the Password Manager, something I ideally would not have to do to stop this behavior) </p><p>Can anyone provide any insight into why Firefox keeps doing this? I love Firefox but lately it's become a drag to use because of this. Thanks all. </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1310582;1310583;,andre.tom
