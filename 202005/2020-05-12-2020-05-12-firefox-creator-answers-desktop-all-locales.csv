It seems like the browser has problems applying the correct colors to the elements, which most of the time results in poor contrast between background and text.

Regarding the latter, the problem seems to be corrected as soon as the element is on focus, and reverts to the wrong colors when focus is lost. </p><p>Interim solution to at least improve readability is to refresh FF while on light mode, and then switch the OS back to dark mode.

Let's say the site is lfoo.bar.baz (it's a subdomain, and the top-level is not a .com). When I open a new tab and type ""l"", Lfoo does not autofill; it is in the dropdown and I have to press the Down arrow to highlight it. This is a big hitch in my workflow, because I expect Ctrl-T L Enter to get me to Lfoo like it did before FF75.  </p><p>This is what I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> I tried config modifications to revert the bar to pre-75 behavior. When they didn't work, I reverted them. </li><li> I removed all other bookmarks with sites that start with L, notably LinkedIn. </li><li> I deleted all instances of LinkedIn (the site that was appearing instead of Lfoo) from my history. After this, instead of autofilling LinkedIn, which I barely use and hadn't visited in 90 days (places.frecency.fourthBucketCutoff), the location bar would not fill in anything after I typed ""l."" </li><li> I gave my Lfoo bookmark the keyword ""l."" This worked, but it's a total hack and I shouldn't have to do it; also, it doesn't autofill lfoo.bar.baz into the location bar, but just moves the cursor down to Lfoo in the dropdown when I type ""l."" </li><li> I ticked ""When using the address bar, suggest"" &gt; ""Browsing history."" This worked, but of course browsing history is now suggested for every other input (which I don't want-- it's why I had this turned off in the first place). I don't want Lfoo suggested on the basis of my history; I want it suggested because it's a bookmark and I asked Firefox to suggest bookmarks. </li></ul> <p>Because lfoo.bar.baz is a subdomain, not a .com, and a redirect to a login page, I suspect it has been discounted for suggestion in spite of it being one of my most-used sites and far and away my most used site that starts with L. </p>",bookmarks;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1312295;,rha.rao

After updating to FF 76 (or even 75) with new Adressbar I often have an issue with incorrect displaying of autocomplete selection.Tried to show on two screenshot: the first one is right after opening a new tab (or closing the last one), url bar autofocused, I've started typing my request (i.e. 'python' on screenshots). Urlbar automatically completing my input to the first shown suggestion, but doesn't separate my input from the added part - there isn't any selection or even cursor. If I switch to another tab or alt-tab to some other window, then back to this input, it restore normal behavior (screenshot 2): manual input is normal text, suggestion is selected. Can't reproduce the issue specially - it happens randomly but regularly. I'm using Firefox for many years with the same profile, didn't modify any settings recently - 99% sure issue came with one of last major updates with modified url bar. Did anyone have the same issue and what can I try to repair it?
