I tried a few of them and they all did the same thing: the screen froze for about 20 seconds, then switched over to a new email in my Outlook (desktop) program, which had already been open (i.e. FF didn't have to wait for the program to open). I tried this from Chrome, and it worked instantly (so, the underlying functions work just fine). I got rid of the addon (I had tried a few of them) and just used the built-in Alf-F ""Email link"" function; it did the same thing. Right now my only quick method is to use Chrome, but I'd prefer Firefox instead.

The only way fix is to restart the browser, but sometimes I even have to restart the PC bc the wi fi connection stops working. Its like if all my bandwidth has been used to load that site but is not enough. I downloaded chrome to see if this happens there but it seems to work ok on chrome, also on edge. </p><p><br> I already cleared the cache, restarted the router, started in sfe mode, updated windows, etc. Did some of you had a similiar issue with this site or same issue but different site maybe? </p>",websites;desktop;,firefox,websites,es,1313266;1313283;1313363;1314171;,lmvb85

I didn't choose either. my first thought i was getting hacked that happens a lot on YouTube. then by its self it said it was going to refresh Firefox then the browser closed. when it came back on it was like i had just installed it. it was asking me all those questions. then it updated then closed again then opened asking me all those questions again then i signed in an all my passowords are gone again. Lucky for me i saved a back-up a few months ago so i only lost a few passwords. the spell checker doesn't work it keeps changing my set home page to Mozilla. I go to a website while i'm there i get that same message safe mode or refresh. now it doesn't give me that message it just refreshes its self without asking me and does it around every 20 minutes so i stopped setting it back up. but tis still doing it. so i uninstalled firefox cleanerd all the leftover files and resistry keys rebooted then downloaded a new copy of the forefox installer. then installed i answered all the questions then set everything up and before i could go to a web site it refreshed its self How do I make it stop? Its refreshed 2 times while i tried to type this so i had to write it in note pad then copy it then paste it here. </p>,firefox-690;firefox-6903;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1313018;1313019;,Mr.Bobcat
