I've typed this password at least several times before (with success) so I was sure that I remember it correctly. Fortunately I had it on the paper. I checked it - and I realized, that I remembered it correctly. So I tried once again but I failed. I tried few times with the same result. I had the same password also for different site. So I logged on that site - with success. So my keyboard seems to work correctly. I didn't change master password in Firefox. At least I am not aware of that. It was unchanged for whole period I used this feature, as I wrote it wasn't long. Fortunately I have all important passwords saved on the paper so I decided to reset my Firefox Master password. It is possible that I've lost less important passwords but I can reset them because I still have access to my most important data. I do not need any help. And I am aware that I could made mistake of any type.

I have properly installed flash in the $MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH directory that firefox looks for; if I go to the plugins section, it shows adobe flash. I also have the ability to play flash files on websites, just not locally. On the profile I'm using to reproduce the error, the http_https_only tag in about:config is set to 'false', so [[this|<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172126</a>]] is irrelevant. I made sure that firefox is indeed what is set to open these types of files via the xdg specifications that firefox searches for when looking what to open a file with via xdg-mime (firefox uses xdg-open on the linux version to see what to open with): xdg-mime default firefox.desktop application/x-shockwave-flash In $HOME/.config/mimeapps.list, it is properly listed in the line applications/x-shockwave-flash=firefox.desktop Firefox does have a .desktop file setup in /usr/share/applications, and xdg-mime does recognize firefox as the app to open swf files. I am able to open other types of files locally such as videos. Going to about:preferences and setting firefox to open swf files makes an infinite loop of firefox opening new tabs that must be then terminated. I'm not sure if an update broke firefox, as I was previously able to open local swf files. Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1337501;,japaneselearning101
