I don't mean multiple windows but multiple sessions of firefox itself where each one has however many windows/tabs that I may have open managed under each instance.  As an example, right now on one of my machines, I see two different two different instances when I attempt to Send Tab To Device (see Groot in attachment).  This has lead to me losing session data as it seems that only one instance is managed by the restore feature.   I don't consider that only one instance being restored a bug but maybe devs think different; I'm not questioning the session restore feature operation here.  What I'm asking here is how to merge multiple instances down to one so that sessions restore will recover all my windows/tabs.  How do I figure out which windows/tabs are with which instance? How do I know which instance will be restored? </p><p>Possible Feature Request: I don't know if multiple instances being started is self inflicted or a by product of some firefox operation encountered during use; I've not deliberately started separate instances.  What would be cool is a feature that only allows one instance to be running at a time.  This feature could warn if there is already a managed instance running if another attempts to start and help to prevent future possible lose of session data. </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kurt39

I notice a similar profile of getting the speeds that are advertised at the start of a contract and then to throttle it as they add more customers to the same kit that they lease from OpenReach; increased latency! I also get OpenReach business notifications and know that the ISPs pay OpenReach for not only bandwidth that they use but also the electricity that powers them, OpenReach also charge for shit loads more but lets stick to the simples! ALL the ISPs deny ANY management function which is disengenuous to say the least!! There is a worrying trend in businesses to not only have no usable phone numbers (I had about eight BT numbers when we had the Cisco Router but NONE work anymore) due to the telephony shit that infests what laughly passes for customer service these days. {Thinks: Is there an undisclosed word limit to this field!?!?? I daren't hit return to go to a new para 'cause it might send like the excreble messaging systems which pass for comms in these benighted days!!
