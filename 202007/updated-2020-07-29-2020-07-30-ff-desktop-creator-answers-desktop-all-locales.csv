Anytime I try to open a swf file, firefox will not open it but instead ask what I should do with the file, over and over again. I have properly installed flash in the $MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH directory that firefox looks for; if I go to the plugins section, it shows adobe flash. I also have the ability to play flash files on websites, just not locally. On the profile I'm using to reproduce the error, the http_https_only tag in about:config is set to 'false', so [[this|<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1172126</a>]] is irrelevant. I made sure that firefox is indeed what is set to open these types of files via the xdg specifications that firefox searches for when looking what to open a file with via xdg-mime (firefox uses xdg-open on the linux version to see what to open with): xdg-mime default firefox.desktop application/x-shockwave-flash In $HOME/.config/mimeapps.list, it is properly listed in the line applications/x-shockwave-flash=firefox.desktop Firefox does have a .desktop file setup in /usr/share/applications, and xdg-mime does recognize firefox as the app to open swf files. I am able to open other types of files locally such as videos. Going to about:preferences and setting firefox to open swf files makes an infinite loop of firefox opening new tabs that must be then terminated. I'm not sure if an update broke firefox, as I was previously able to open local swf files.

I recently backed up my Mozilla Roaming and Local profiles to an external drive before replacing the hard drive in my laptop. I also separately made a backup of my bookmarks. After replacing my hard drive with a new one, I restored an earlier image file of my computer in order to put back all my data onto the new drive. </p><pre>Then I did a Fresh Start, effectively doing a new install of Windows 10 (v.1903). </pre> <p>(As far as I can tell, my old Firefox data was deleted during the Fresh Start reinstall.) </p><p>I now did a new install of Firefox onto my computer. After I opened it I synced and it seems that all my bookmarks, etc came back. The only two problems: 1) All my hundreds of bookmark favicons had been replaced with a generic globe. 2) My last session (which had scores of tabs), was not restored. So I tried copying and pasting the saved profiles back into the new Mozilla Roaming and Local profiles, but I can't get Firefox to access them.  Instead, it only accesses the new profile. I did an uninstall and tried it again, but all I ended up doing is creating another new profile. Now when I go to About:Profiles (see image), the default-release and default profiles listed don't seem to exist anymore (they aren't loadable, and they can't be found using the filepath noted there), and the actual backup profiles that I copied from my portable drive into Mozilla and that I actually see in File Explorer, doesn't show up as a profile choice. How can I restore my old backed up profile, and will that solve my missing favicons problem? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1337487;1337500;,blue_sky

I signed into sync  as usual because this is not the first time I've had to do this over the last few years actually about two months ago I did the exact same thing to another computer with no issues on the same account. This time however sync did everything except for all my add ins after waiting, trying to find solutions online etc. etc. gave up, but gave it 24 hours more to try to figure out what was going on. Ran across a few articles that Firefox 79 change something with sync but don't understand exactly what they're talking about why this would affect this installation, so I then looked at  the versions installed on each system, my main system is running Firefox 78 or I should say was running Firefox 78 I thought upgrading it to 79 would fix the issue so I did and that did not work. in the meantime I proceeded to uninstall Firefox 79 on the second machine that refuses to sync the add-ons and replace it with Firefox 78, during this process I removed all Firefox entries related to profiles installs updates etc. I tried to wipe every mention of Firefox on the machine as if it never have Firefox installed on it before. Installed 78 signed in to sink expecting everything to work as normal and still nothing it's been two hours since the install I have re-synced multiple times in hopes of getting it to work with no success it appears to sync everything but the add-ons, and yes I have add-ons on the sync list on all computers have double triple and quadruple checked that to make sure . I really don't want to have to manually run from computer to computer to figure out what add-ons I have and all the settings of each one to make it perfect because I have had issues in the past of installing an add-on on one machine and the settings being different on another causing issues between the add-ons would appreciate if somebody could tell me how why or what the hell I'm supposed to do here to make Firefox think actually work again the way it had worked for years I really need these computers identical in every way as i am disabled and have mobility issues such related to all be installing and uninstalling. Thanks for your help in this matter and I'll do my best to answer any questions to help you guys figure this out. Also I'm not even remotely familiar how to file bug reports or anything else so somebody wants to suggest that I would appreciated if they are able to do it on my behalf and I will give them all the information so it's done properly. Thanks againI just noticed that there's troubleshooting information able to be shared this information is being shared from the computer that works absolutely perfect and is the computer I want to sync from below if somebody wants to explain to me how I can get that data and add it to this post so you guys can compare and figure out what the heck the problem is I will do it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",hillvalleyfarms

It used to be that I would just copy the users over and everything would be cool (XP to W7 didn't give me this problem) but it's not working this time.  My guess is that it's because my old laptop used Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  My desktop monster uses Windows 10 Pro but this new laptop uses Windows 10 Home (which is just awful compared to Pro) so there's probably an issue with how the user profiles are handled.  I didn't have a Firefox account because I didn't want every machine I use to have the same Firefox setup.
