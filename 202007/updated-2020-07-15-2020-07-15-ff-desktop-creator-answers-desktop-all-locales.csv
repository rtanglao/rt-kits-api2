When I type a search term or web address into the bar and hit the enter key, nothing happens. Nothing happens when I click the ""go"" arrow on the righthand edge of the bar either.  </p><p>When I first click on the bar, a menu pops up below it and one of the options is ""search with Google"". If I click this option, it puts @google at the beginning of the bar, and search works just fine. But this extra step is irritating, and it doesn't work to take me directly to a website. For example to get to Pinterest, instead of typing <a href=""http://pinterest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pinterest.com</a> in the bar and going directly there, I have to type ""@google pinterest"", and click on the first search result.  </p><p>I read some past topics addressing this question, and have tried clearing my cache, refreshing Firefox, and restarting Firefox in SafeMode. None of these have helped (and even in SafeMode I still had the same problem). Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. </p>",websites;firefox-780;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,websites,en-US,1332891;,ritanichols75
