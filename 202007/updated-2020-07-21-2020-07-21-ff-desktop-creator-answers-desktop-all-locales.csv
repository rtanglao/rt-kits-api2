Since the FF update in June, we are having random users crash everyday and the only thing that will get them working is to re-install FF  we have the latest ESR and the regular version all on latest versions .  Out of 200 or so PCs, we have at least 4 or 5 random users crashing daily.   its not happening for me, but for many others its a regular thing.    </p><p>Is there a paid option for FF support to help troubleshoot this?  we cannot just go to another browser at this time.  below is an example of error.  can provide crash reports if needed.  we have sent some crash reports but nothing so far has fixed this. Boss man thinks its due to one program or another causing this to close xul.dll __ just started crashing again with every launch. </p><p>AvailablePageFile: 10948079616 AvailablePhysicalMemory: 3160023040 AvailableVirtualMemory: 138531589087232 BreakpadReserveAddress: 2081169473536 BreakpadReserveSize: 83886080 BuildID: 20200429190206 CPUMicrocodeVersion: 0xb4 CrashTime: 1588969132 FramePoisonBase: 9223372036600889344 FramePoisonSize: 65536 InstallTime: 1588767561 ModuleSignatureInfo: {""McAfee, Inc."":[""EpMPThe.dll"",""EpMPApi.dll""],""Microsoft Corporation"":[""msvcp140.dll"",""msvcp140.dll"",""VCRUNTIME140.dll"",""VCRUNTIME140.dll""],""Microsoft Windows"":[""nsi.dll"",""NapiNSP.dll"",""pnrpnsp.dll"",""winrnr.dll"",""winmm.dll"",""webauthn.dll"",""DWrite.dll"",""wsock32.dll"",""WINMMBASE.dll"",""usp10.dll"",""wbemsvc.dll"",""wbemprox.dll"",""wbemcomn.dll"",""version.dll"",""dbgcore.dll"",""dbghelp.dll"",""wtsapi32.dll"",""dhcpcsvc.dll"",""avrt.dll"",""credui.dll"",""nlaapi.dll"",""d3d11.dll"",""wshbth.dll"",""uxtheme.dll"",""dwmapi.dll"",""ntmarta.dll"",""DXCore.dll"",""dxgi.dll"",""IPHLPAPI.DLL"",""dnsapi.dll"",""mswsock.dll"",""CRYPTBASE.DLL"",""devobj.dll"",""userenv.dll"",""umpdc.dll"",""powrprof.dll"",""msasn1.dll"",""kernel.appcore.dll"",""profapi.dll"",""windows.storage.dll"",""msvcp_win.dll"",""cryptsp.dll"",""bcrypt.dll"",""wintrust.dll"",""ucrtbase.dll"",""gdi32full.dll"",""crypt32.dll"",""KERNELBASE.dll"",""cfgmgr32.dll"",""bcryptPrimitives.dll"",""win32u.dll"",""oleaut32.dll"",""msvcrt.dll"",""sechost.dll"",""user32.dll"",""advapi32.dll"",""psapi.dll"",""SHCore.dll"",""shlwapi.dll"",""combase.dll"",""ws2_32.dll"",""setupapi.dll"",""imm32.dll"",""clbcatq.dll"",""shell32.dll"",""gdi32.dll"",""rpcrt4.dll"",""ole32.dll"",""kernel32.dll"",""ntdll.dll""],""Mozilla Corporation"":[""firefox.exe"",""xul.dll"",""nss3.dll"",""mozglue.dll"",""lgpllibs.dll""]} ProductID: {ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384} ProductName: Firefox ReleaseChannel: esr SafeMode: 0 SecondsSinceLastCrash: 1414 StartupCrash: 1 StartupTime: 1588969132 SystemMemoryUsePercentage: 62 ThreadIdNameMapping: 680:""Gecko_IOThread"",18824:""JS Watchdog"",19360:""JS Helper"",2804:""JS Helper"",1884:""JS Helper"",14320:""JS Helper"",1656:""JS Helper"",13604:""JS Helper"",12392:""JS Helper"",16680:""JS Helper"",4912:""Timer"",16648:""Link Monitor"",12732:""Socket Thread"",15080:""BGReadURLs"",6128:""LSP Annotator"", Throttleable: 1 TotalPageFile: 18174980096 TotalPhysicalMemory: 8511303680 TotalVirtualMemory: 140737488224256 URL:  UptimeTS: 3.04721 Vendor: Mozilla Version: 68.8.0 </p><p>This report also contains technical information about the state of the application when it crashed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-680;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1334810;1334818;1334825;1334834;,gdonohue
