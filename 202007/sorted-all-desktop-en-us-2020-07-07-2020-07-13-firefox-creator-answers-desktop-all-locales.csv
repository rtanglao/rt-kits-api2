My other extensions are listed in the ""Installed Plugins"" part.  The issue seems to happen on both Kubuntu and Windows. Thank you for reading. EDIT: I tried without Color, and it worked.

I do not want to make my webpage font size bigger, just the bookmarks toolbar font. It is infuriating to have this change take place without me specifically doing anything and I should not have to download an add-on or extension to fix this (nor should I have to do some weird about:config thing that someone else posted; that makes zero sense to me and is potentially dangerous). What the heck happened with the most recent update and why are there no controls to adjust toolbar font size in the preferences!?!?!?!? ",other;firefox-780;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,en-US
