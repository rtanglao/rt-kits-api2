(I do not have problems with any other shortcuts I have created, only the Walmart website shortcut).  The problem only began recently, as I have had a shortcut on my desktop for Walmart for months now. When the website locked up on me one day I deleted the original shortcut I had at that time, and I have tried many times since to create another one, but none will work.   I am able to click and drag, from the Walmart website, to the desktop, to create the shortcut, however when I click on the shortcut to open it I only get a blank page.  This is ONLY with the Walmart shortcut I create.  What's going on, and why is this happening!
