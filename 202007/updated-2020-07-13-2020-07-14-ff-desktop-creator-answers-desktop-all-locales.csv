So you have to decide which way you want to move the window and choose the appropriate end of the tab bar. Compared to Chrome, the FF tab bar is really skinny - even though the difference is only about 1/16 or 1/8 inch, that small difference is enough in Chrome to grab the window where you want and drag it without opening the tab right below where you're grabbing.

If you for example open 5 tabs and then close firefox (and wait 2 minutes and check in the task-manager that its closed) and then deleting everything in the 'sessionstore-backups' folder and then starting firefox, then the 5 tabs are there again. I have made backups the moment firefox was not working anymore, but firefox seems to anyhow not load them (have multiple recovery files saved after first problems, instantly). I got the folder from about:support 'open directory' but i'm using Linux (Linux Mint 19 - Firefox 77.0.1). Maybe sessions are saved elsewhere? Firefox even inreased the data inside of them by the new 5 Tabs, so they grow in size, and if you opened it in a text editor you could search the new tabs even, as far as i remember from yesterday. Then i don't remember the order of two things from yesterday: </p><p><br> 1. I moved some recently 'changed' files from the profile folder and then move them back (i wanted to backup, but i moved and the problem was somehow firefox was starting at the same time, it was a mistake, and then i had trouble not knowing if the preferences are still the same, and since i updated from i think 64 to 77.0.1 (i have a list of important changes) some where different, for example i would never have geolocation enabled. but others like the deleted pocket links (in about:config) are still the way they are, so i wonder. and i had multiple files in the moment </p><p><br> 2. the sessionstore now is little (5 tabs probably), i tried to delete session store very often, i dont know if it was after this? but probably. But like i said i don't remember it. </p><p><br> </p><p>But now the new problem. The History and Book marks file does not work, i moved them away or deleted them (of course backup before that) because this was an online tip, but the restoring thing just worked for the bookmarks, and just something between i think 1-3 days ago. </p><p><br> The problem now is i can't recover ANYTHING anymore. I can not really read the recovery file with a text editor, many letters are red, with the linux text editor, it says translated something like ""some symbols don't work, please choose encoding"" and there are many: </p><p>UTF-8 Central European (WINDOWS-1250) Unicode (UTF-16) Western (IBM-850) Unicode (UTF-7) ... </p><p>Over 50 different probably.

In the older Firefox versions it was a preference in  about:preferences#advanced  page: "" warn me when websites try to redirect or relod the page ""  and i was kept it  unticked , but now i can't find it.

If I want to sign in to a specific site automatically while still generally deleting cookies when I turn off Firefox, then I need to list all the cookies used by that site in Manage Permissions as Allow. This is easy regarding sites that use cookies all with pme common domain, since you just enter the one domain name. Today I wanted to preserve cookies from a major newspaper, but I find at least five domain names in the cookies that I have to protect in order to enable auto sign-in for that one site. My suggestion is that there be some improved method for easily 'transfering' (rather than writing down and re-keying) selected cookie domains from Manage Data to Manage Permissions, instead of having to rekey them and make errors doing that. If I want to auto sign-in to 15 sites, but keep the controls set for deleting unprotected cookies when closing Firefox, I would have to enter perhaps 75 domains by hand. An alternative might be a column in Manage Cookies whereby I could check mark a cookie, thereby transfering it to show in Manage Permissions, perhaps as defaulting to Allow for Session. Then I could review them and if desired switch each to Allow. </p>",cookies;firefox-780;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",Quenchoo

If you select to print (not in the browser, choosing the feature on the web page) the browser appears to hang with no response for several minutes.

But the problem is when you try to print certain information that is embedded in the page (i.e. results from a medical test, a receipt from a credit card payment) you have to utilize the print link on the page to get the correction information to print.

I can also save the bookmark to the toolbar and it appears there. Also I can cut an paste the bookmark from the toolbar to the folder.  I've tried disabling add-ons and that doesn't fix the problem.
