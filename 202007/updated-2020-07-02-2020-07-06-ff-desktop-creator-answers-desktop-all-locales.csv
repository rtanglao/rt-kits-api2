I have very few sites where ABP allows ads. I have Bitdefender for antivirus. I have reset Firefox at least 5 times this past 6 weeks.  This has gotten old.

It doesn't even show up in the play section when prompted.   So what's the sense of that? After resetting Firefox, I fail to understand why in the most viewed panel, why my most viewed aren't there after each reset?  Also, why doesn't it populate my most viewed consistently?  That being, if I go to the same sites all the time, why don't they show as most viewed?  I get sites showing up I've only been to once in a month, instead of multiple times in a day.

Now, normally this wouldn't be a problem as the top of the screen would cut off any extra padding. However, using a program that reserves the screen edge shows that a maximized Firefox window indeed extends past the regular window border by exactly 8 pixels. </p><p>What's more, when using Windows Snap on two separate Firefox windows, one of the windows respects the screen edge while the other does not! This leads to the window control buttons at the top right of both windows to be in different vertical positions, which is difficult to use. </p><p>No other programs I have exhibit this behavior, which is why I'm turning to Mozilla support.

Previously if such an event would happen, upon restart Firefox would ask if I want to restore previous session after ""a crash"" (also showing a sad bear icon) and i would restore my previous session successfully. Alternatively, I would manually press the ""restore previous browsing session"" button in the menu (if not prompted automatically to do so upon starting Firefox). However, today, after the disconnection, when I tried starting Firefox, it first ran some update before opening up and didn't give me the window asking if I want to restore previous browsing session. The button for restoring previous browsing session manually in the menu was also greyed out. Somehow the option/preference to restore previous session seems to have been unselected (but not by me!)... I have already tried working with some solutions I found through Google searches about this problem and posted on this forum (including working with previous.js - a file which I can not find) but I haven't been successful though I am not sure if I was getting everything stated right. In the sessionstore-backup folder I could only find recovery.js and recovery.bak files only, nothing else, despite folder settings being set to show hidden files. I must note though that my browsing history is still there, and again, having already opened my Firefox once, I have not closed it again so it's still running on the first instance (currently on the latest version of Firefox) after the crash/restart/update/failed-restore-of-previous-browsing-session...I hope that's hopeful :( </p><p>Please help, I had critical stuff I was working on through multiple tabs over the past ""few months"" and it would be a nightmare to try and comb through the history to restore it piece by piece considering that it shows even the stuff I had closed and was no longer working with...restoring the session would greatly help  :( </p>",tabs;firefox-780;desktop;windows-81;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1330100;1330118;1330157;1330171;1330428;1330570;,troymargetsy

So what I have done is on max the window is where I get this problem. Min. the size window goes away if the screen's location is about 1"" down from the top of the frame on the screen. If I move it up some just a little 3/4"" it seems to be a small drop down window again. If I move it up even more not to the max but just up to say about 1/2"" the drop down window gets bigger however it is still cut down with no way to scroll down to see the rest of the window. So what my thoughts are is the over scan of the video is too big? If so how do I take care of it? I hope this helps out. Let me know thank you for your help on this matter. So if I go to single display its all good on the laptop window. </p><p>UPDATE: So I have also played with other web browser, Chrome and Edge and I can't recreate it in those browsers.

It seems to be triggered by the mouse scrolling wheel.  I have removed and reloaded Firefox but still the same, when reloading it recognises the previous instalation and recalls some previous settings, I don't seem to be able to stop this happening.

My standard browsing habit consists of launching browser with 1 pinned tab and 1 home page (so 2 tabs only), then opening 5-10 tabs from my bookmarks, checking pages then closing them and leaving only 1 pinned page open. In firefox 78.0.1 after doing this (opening and then closing multiple tabs ""to the right"" using new context menu added in 78) my ram usage does not drop. It goes from 2.4GB (system only usage) to 5.0GB and does not drop after closing tabs. However when I open 10-20 tabs again RAM usage does not rise (maybe slightly, like 5.3GB). So it looks like firefox has multiple tabs stored in ram and opening new tabs just rewrites that memory instead of allocating new one. I have 8GB of ram so 3GB of usage from 1 open tab is crazy. I think it was 500-900MB before. I also have terrible lags because of this - browser hangs up every few seconds for few seconds. I had trouble writing this post with 2 tabs open because of 3.3GB ram usage! Restarting browser helps - ram uasge rises from 2.4GB to 3.2GB only (800MB for 2 tabs) but every new opened and closed tab seems to stay in memory. For example if I open 10 more tabs except for 2 that always open so I have 12 tabs I have 3.6GB memory usage. After I close them it slowly drops to 3.5GB instead of returning to 3.2GB. It does not matter how I close tabs - using right click context menu (close other tabs, close tabs to the right), using X on tabs, or using add-on to close all tabs except for pinned ones. They always remain in memory somehow. PLS fix this ASAP. </p><p>P.S. I also tried checking about:performance menu but there is nothing interesting here. It says that 2 opened tabs and addons use 100MB of memory which is not true because browser at this moment uses 1060MB. </p><p>Update 1: I also tested safe mode. 3,4GB of PC RAM usage on firefox safe mode start. Opened few tabs, ram usage goes to 4.2GB. After closing all tabs except for 1 ram usage start to SLOWLY decrease but it stops at 3,7GB. Ram usage drop was really slow like 10-30 seconds. It should be instant after closing tabs. </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Piterk

The next time I go to that site, again my password doesn't work, so I open up Chrome and get in with no problem.

(I believe I understand private windows to use the RAM for caching but use the HDD under normal circumstances?) - Enabling/disabling VPN makes no difference, nor does what network I'm on, and other devices on this network have no similar issues - Other browsers on the same computer have no issues  - Malware, anti-virus, etc all are active and scan has been run a few times.  - Apple's hardware diagnostic turns up no issues, and this has happened now in FF over multiple of the latest versions (not sure when exactly it started) on two different Macbooks, though the new one is from an image of the old one (maybe that's something?) - Uninstalling/reinstalling FF does not make a difference  </p><p><strong>Where I'm at:</strong> The only thing that sort of worked (But it's now stopped working on certain sites, but continues to work for others) is moving FF's profile folder, uninstalling, and reinstalling. I was lead to believe FF would then create a new folder when this happened, but it just kicked up an error for me and wouldn't start. When I moved the old profile folder back and started up the freshly installed version with the old profile folder, the problems were all solved. Though as mentioned, they are starting to happen again on some of the sites. No errors or changes have been made that I can identify, plenty of space available on the HDD, etc.  </p><p>I've become a big fan of FF over the years (over Chrome), and want to stay in a privacy-focused browser, but I haven't been able to find much that seems to help this specific situation online.

I have just been updated to version <strong>78.0.1 (64-bit)</strong> I have a large number of .lnk files that drive my work. As of this update, Firefox no longer opens these files, instead it forces me to download the link file, and then click on the downloaded link file to instatiate it. Of course, this means that I cannot open the link file in Private mode. This is cluttering up my download folder, forcing the web page referenced into non-private mode, and causing cascading problems from there. What is the setting that will allow me to click on my bookmarked .lnk files (which in most cases open .html web pages) and open directly. If I can't do this then I'll have to migrate away from Firefox, which I absolutely do not want to do. </p><p>Thank you.

Whenever I need to restart my computer, I close my session, restart, reopen Firefox and it loads my entire session no problem. The neat thing about this is that when I do this, the tab title (along with the website icon) is preserved but the actual page only reloads when I switch to that tab. For example, imagine I have a YouTube video titled ""Programming in Python"", the tab would say ""Programming in Python - YouTube"" with the YouTube logo to the left of the title. There is definitely some kind of cache magic going on because say if that video was taken down on YouTube, the title would still be preserved until I switch to that tab. In my latest reloaded session, I noticed that tabs #250-500 failed to load the tab title and instead show the website URL with the icon I attached below. Is there any way to reload these tab titles without actually refreshing the page manually one by one (kinda like how Firefox does it on startup)?

This has lead to me losing session data as it seems that only one instance is managed by the restore feature.

How do I know which instance will be restored? </p><p>Possible Feature Request: I don't know if multiple instances being started is self inflicted or a by product of some firefox operation encountered during use; I've not deliberately started separate instances.  What would be cool is a feature that only allows one instance to be running at a time.  This feature could warn if there is already a managed instance running if another attempts to start and help to prevent future possible lose of session data. </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1329455;,kurt39

I also get OpenReach business notifications and know that the ISPs pay OpenReach for not only bandwidth that they use but also the electricity that powers them, OpenReach also charge for shit loads more but lets stick to the simples! ALL the ISPs deny ANY management function which is disengenuous to say the least!!
