Of late, I have observed that the Twitter's display settings which I set in my Twitter A/c settings (by using the More-&gt;Display option doesn't save the display settings I set for the Twitter account. Every time I close and open the FF browser, it reverts to the default arge font and blue colour setting which I dislike and prefer to set it to the smallest font size and a color of my choice.  This seems to be happening after my browser was upgraded to Version 78 (or 78.0.2) so something in this new version seems to reject my Twitter display settings for some reason. Would be grateful if someone can help fix this. Thanks. </p><p>Ramesh </p>",websites;firefox-780;desktop;windows-81;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",rameshiyer

I want my history to be stored indefinitely, just like how my Google searches are stored for me to refer to when I want/need to.  4.
