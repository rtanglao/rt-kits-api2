If Firefox printints to that printer it works, but if any other printer is later selected, Firefox sends the job to the new printer but the paper format stays as the same as the label printer.  The proper paper sizes are set in the printer properties but Firefox seems to ignore them. No other browser software has this issue. Yes, I've reset the printer settings a number of times, the printers all work until another label is printed, then Firefox is again stuck on that label format. This is has been an issue with previous releases of Firefox, and it continues even with the latest release. Regrettably, if I need to print labels, Firefox is not used because of the need to reset all the printer settings afterwards.  I like Firefox, but with this annoying problem, it will not be used often. Any suggestions other then to continue to reset the printer's  settings? Thanks.

The only places I can see to grab the window without accidentally opening tabs or dragging the tab off the tab bar into a new window are at each far end of the tab bar. So you have to decide which way you want to move the window and choose the appropriate end of the tab bar. Compared to Chrome, the FF tab bar is really skinny - even though the difference is only about 1/16 or 1/8 inch, that small difference is enough in Chrome to grab the window where you want and drag it without opening the tab right below where you're grabbing. I hope this description makes sense - hard to put it into words. ",tabs;firefox-780;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,en-US
