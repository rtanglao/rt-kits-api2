I did and got 78.0.1 (64-bit) for Windows 7. Later I was deleting a program - winpdfeditor - in the Windows control panel and, at completion, suddenly got a message that Firefox was updating (again), but this time with a big bold warning - as I recall - that this version was not synched with anything. This new Firefox opened. My regular version, the one I'd updated this morning -- let's call it FF-1 -- was also open. In the second version (FF-2) I immediately checked under Tools &gt; Options &gt; Logins and Passwords, and the passwords section was empty. I closed FF-2. FF-1 is still open and still has all my passwords. I checked my Mozilla &gt; Firefox &gt; Profiles folder and now have two profiles - one called <strong>jn******.default</strong>, where I can see all my regular FF files, including logins.json, and one called <strong>i6******.default-release</strong>, with all files created today and no logins.json. Windows control panel also tells me I have two FFs, but identifies them as v78.01 and v72.02, and says both were installed today.   I just checked <strong>about:profiles</strong> and get this: ""Another copy of Firefox has made changes to profiles. You must restart Firefox before making more changes.""  What to do now?

Now, normally this wouldn't be a problem as the top of the screen would cut off any extra padding. However, using a program that reserves the screen edge shows that a maximized Firefox window indeed extends past the regular window border by exactly 8 pixels. </p><p>What's more, when using Windows Snap on two separate Firefox windows, one of the windows respects the screen edge while the other does not! This leads to the window control buttons at the top right of both windows to be in different vertical positions, which is difficult to use. </p><p>No other programs I have exhibit this behavior, which is why I'm turning to Mozilla support. I don't know if the issue has to do with the browser or how Windows 10 renders the desktop, but it throws off the design of the desktop as I intend to display it. </p><p>In the provided example picture, the left window demonstrates predicted behavior where the upper border of the window is at the position I intend (40 pixels from the true screen edge), while the right window can be seen extending past the left one by exactly 8 pixels. I have tried this with extensions disabled, in safe mode, and every other way I can think of and the problem persists. No other programs exhibit this issue.

Need updated directions to move tabs below bookmarks bar.,"<p>This is very frustrating and I hope you can help me. Every time Firefox updates the tabs move up to the top of the browser, when I need them below the bookmarks bar, where they used to be. I did get instructions on how to do it for v. 72 (I think), but now I've updated to v. 78 and the tabs are again at the top. The instructions for changing the css: file go up to v. 74 only. Also, in the css: file I'm not sure how much of what's already there should be replace. The entire file? Or? This is probably frustrating for a whole raft of people, but for older ones like me (I'm 76) it's particularly maddening. I would appreciate any help I can get. Also, where would I submit my suggestion to Mozilla to just add a blasted toggle for moving the tabs back and forth. It would make a whole lot of people happy. BTW, I'm attaching a screenshot of the first page of what appears to be at least 8 pages of css: code. Should I delete all of it or...?

It seems to be triggered by the mouse scrolling wheel.

My standard browsing habit consists of launching browser with 1 pinned tab and 1 home page (so 2 tabs only), then opening 5-10 tabs from my bookmarks, checking pages then closing them and leaving only 1 pinned page open. In firefox 78.0.1 after doing this (opening and then closing multiple tabs ""to the right"" using new context menu added in 78) my ram usage does not drop. It goes from 2.4GB (system only usage) to 5.0GB and does not drop after closing tabs. However when I open 10-20 tabs again RAM usage does not rise (maybe slightly, like 5.3GB). So it looks like firefox has multiple tabs stored in ram and opening new tabs just rewrites that memory instead of allocating new one. I have 8GB of ram so 3GB of usage from 1 open tab is crazy. I think it was 500-900MB before. I also have terrible lags because of this - browser hangs up every few seconds for few seconds. I had trouble writing this post with 2 tabs open because of 3.3GB ram usage! Restarting browser helps - ram uasge rises from 2.4GB to 3.2GB only (800MB for 2 tabs) but every new opened and closed tab seems to stay in memory. For example if I open 10 more tabs except for 2 that always open so I have 12 tabs I have 3.6GB memory usage. After I close them it slowly drops to 3.5GB instead of returning to 3.2GB. It does not matter how I close tabs - using right click context menu (close other tabs, close tabs to the right), using X on tabs, or using add-on to close all tabs except for pinned ones. They always remain in memory somehow. PLS fix this ASAP. </p><p>P.S. I also tried checking about:performance menu but there is nothing interesting here. It says that 2 opened tabs and addons use 100MB of memory which is not true because browser at this moment uses 1060MB. </p><p>Update 1: I also tested safe mode. 3,4GB of PC RAM usage on firefox safe mode start. Opened few tabs, ram usage goes to 4.2GB. After closing all tabs except for 1 ram usage start to SLOWLY decrease but it stops at 3,7GB. Ram usage drop was really slow like 10-30 seconds. It should be instant after closing tabs. </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Piterk

But disabling all extensions and plugins in a normal window doesn't solve it. (I believe I understand private windows to use the RAM for caching but use the HDD under normal circumstances?) - Enabling/disabling VPN makes no difference, nor does what network I'm on, and other devices on this network have no similar issues - Other browsers on the same computer have no issues  - Malware, anti-virus, etc all are active and scan has been run a few times.  - Apple's hardware diagnostic turns up no issues, and this has happened now in FF over multiple of the latest versions (not sure when exactly it started) on two different Macbooks, though the new one is from an image of the old one (maybe that's something?) - Uninstalling/reinstalling FF does not make a difference  </p><p><strong>Where I'm at:</strong> The only thing that sort of worked (But it's now stopped working on certain sites, but continues to work for others) is moving FF's profile folder, uninstalling, and reinstalling. I was lead to believe FF would then create a new folder when this happened, but it just kicked up an error for me and wouldn't start. When I moved the old profile folder back and started up the freshly installed version with the old profile folder, the problems were all solved. Though as mentioned, they are starting to happen again on some of the sites. No errors or changes have been made that I can identify, plenty of space available on the HDD, etc.  </p><p>I've become a big fan of FF over the years (over Chrome), and want to stay in a privacy-focused browser, but I haven't been able to find much that seems to help this specific situation online.

I have just been updated to version <strong>78.0.1 (64-bit)</strong> I have a large number of .lnk files that drive my work. As of this update, Firefox no longer opens these files, instead it forces me to download the link file, and then click on the downloaded link file to instatiate it. Of course, this means that I cannot open the link file in Private mode. This is cluttering up my download folder, forcing the web page referenced into non-private mode, and causing cascading problems from there. What is the setting that will allow me to click on my bookmarked .lnk files (which in most cases open .html web pages) and open directly. If I can't do this then I'll have to migrate away from Firefox, which I absolutely do not want to do. </p><p>Thank you.

Whenever I need to restart my computer, I close my session, restart, reopen Firefox and it loads my entire session no problem. The neat thing about this is that when I do this, the tab title (along with the website icon) is preserved but the actual page only reloads when I switch to that tab. For example, imagine I have a YouTube video titled ""Programming in Python"", the tab would say ""Programming in Python - YouTube"" with the YouTube logo to the left of the title. There is definitely some kind of cache magic going on because say if that video was taken down on YouTube, the title would still be preserved until I switch to that tab. In my latest reloaded session, I noticed that tabs #250-500 failed to load the tab title and instead show the website URL with the icon I attached below. Is there any way to reload these tab titles without actually refreshing the page manually one by one (kinda like how Firefox does it on startup)? This is kinda how I navigate and it isn't helpful seeing just a URL. </p>",firefox-690;tabs;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1329407;1329408;,k2.t.cho

This has lead to me losing session data as it seems that only one instance is managed by the restore feature.   I don't consider that only one instance being restored a bug but maybe devs think different; I'm not questioning the session restore feature operation here.  What I'm asking here is how to merge multiple instances down to one so that sessions restore will recover all my windows/tabs.  How do I figure out which windows/tabs are with which instance? How do I know which instance will be restored? </p><p>Possible Feature Request: I don't know if multiple instances being started is self inflicted or a by product of some firefox operation encountered during use; I've not deliberately started separate instances.  What would be cool is a feature that only allows one instance to be running at a time.

I rotate ISPs regularly and have been at this shit since the WWW was invented and have even bought a Cisco router to host our own web site in the 1990s. I KNOW that the ISPs manage my connection speeds, router management software WILL be more capable than the Cisco router we managed ourselves!! I notice a similar profile of getting the speeds that are advertised at the start of a contract and then to throttle it as they add more customers to the same kit that they lease from OpenReach; increased latency! I also get OpenReach business notifications and know that the ISPs pay OpenReach for not only bandwidth that they use but also the electricity that powers them, OpenReach also charge for shit loads more but lets stick to the simples! ALL the ISPs deny ANY management function which is disengenuous to say the least!! There is a worrying trend in businesses to not only have no usable phone numbers (I had about eight BT numbers when we had the Cisco Router but NONE work anymore) due to the telephony shit that infests what laughly passes for customer service these days. {Thinks: Is there an undisclosed word limit to this field!?!?? I daren't hit return to go to a new para 'cause it might send like the excreble messaging systems which pass for comms in these benighted days!! My point for the designers of Firefox is: when I try to do ""Speed test I can count up to FIVE seconds before a Ping is registered which is never more than a 100ms so that's bollocks! Then it doesn't matter how many tabs I have open (often shit loads) the speeds that I get are independant and even when I'm ""listening"" to radio articles that doesn't effect the results either! A GENUINE speed test should be built into Firefox don't ya think?? </p>",other;firefox-780;desktop;mac-os;escalate;,firefox,other,en-US,1329413;1329508;,joestoner49
