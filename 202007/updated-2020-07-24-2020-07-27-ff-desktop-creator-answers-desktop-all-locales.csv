I also can't tell if there is one sole cause of all of these issues or several, but please do your best to explain what's going on. </p><p>1-2 months ago, some strange things started happening with my computer repeatedly. Consistently, a command prompt would open unexpectedly, saying something about Chromium failing to update. I couldn't do anything with that program, so I just X'd it out, and maybe around a minute later Firefox would crash and restart. Once that happened, my Firefox home page would be set to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a>, and the default search engine would also be changed to Yahoo!. And on my desktop, shortcuts for Internet Explorer and Chromium would be added, and the shortcut for Chromium would be automatically pinned to my taskbar. </p><p>Windows Security would then notify me that it's blocked a threat, so I'd go to check it out and remove said threat. Every time, it;d say the blocked threat makes changes to browser settings without proper permission, and the blocked threat is called ""sodecitot.exe"", located in a filepath like c:\programdata\{5b729525-380e-6a38-89c28-8402d0dace36}\sodecitot.exe (just in case it's some obscure ID, I've swapped out those numbers and letters with random numbers and letters). Then Windows Security reports ""Remediation incomplete"" on the same threat, implying it attempted to restore itself. That letter and number folder name notably follows the same format as a bunch of folders which were last modified when I first turned on this computer on January 1, 2019. </p><p>I was getting a lot of such reports from Windows Security on very similar threats, having various different letters and numbers for their folder names, and I figured it was likely malware, so I made several full scans with MSERT, Malwarebytes, Windows Security, and Windows Defender Online Scan, all to no avail. </p><p>I don't even know why Internet Explorer is installed, but its files were last modified in February 2019, so I think it's just a shortcut that was added. </p><p>I'm not sure what Chromium is or why it's installed either. I tried to look it up to learn more about it but found nothing useful, and its executable looks like a blue version of Google Chrome's logo. Some parts of Chromium's installation were last modified in October 2019, but most of its files were modified just today. </p><p>Notably as well, when these problems started happening 1-2 months ago, there were two instances of all of my desktop shortcuts having weird visual issues, one being the little arrows on the shortcuts (which indicates it's a shortcut and not an actual file) being replaced with a X's, and a separate instance where the Audacity logo was over top every other shortcut for a few minutes. </p><p>With the same events happening today, a new error message opened, saying something about Windows Explorer attempting to load the C runtime library incorrectly (screenshot included). </p><p>I also considered turning to Mozilla, Google, and/or Microsoft support when this was originally happening, but then it suddenly stopped. I had a bunch of screenshots of some of the weirder things, but since nothing was happening for a while I deleted them. Now, 1-2 months later, it's starting right back up and I don't know why. I suspect it all links back to Chromium, but I'm not sure if I can just delete its files and call it quits, because I don't know if it's supposed to be there. It seems like something by Google, but I can't even confirm that. </p><p>So yeah. Any suggestions? </p><p><br> </p><p>My computer has a Windows 10 operating system. Mozilla Firefox is installed and constantly open, used for entertainment. Google Chrome is installed and constantly open, used for work. Apparently, some part of Google Chrome's installation trips off Malwarebytes whenever I make a scan. Removing it causes Chrome to crash, and once I open it again that part is replaced. Usually, I just remove it so I don't miss any other threats, and then just restore my closed tabs. Audacity is installed and has a desktop shortcut. Internet Explorer is apparently installed, and there is no uninstall executable as far as I can tell. Whatever it is, Chromium seems to keep trying to install itself, with parts of it already existing on my computer. </p>",desktop;other;malware;escalate;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1336551;1336552;,jcclay1

I solved the problem by installing an extended release version of Firefox, 52.7.4, which still supported the maff extension.  Et voilà, all my maff files now open. </p><p>I have held onto my old XP machine because I have a boatload of legacy graphic programs which I do not want to spend the hundreds of dollars to upgrade to Windows 7 or 10 versions.  Recently someone gave me an XP machine which is newer and has a much better processor than my own.   </p><p>So I figured if I just install Firefox_ESR_52.7.4 I would easily be able to open those maff files I wish to store on the (new) XP machine. </p><p>Curious thing, the only version I could find to download Firefox_ESR_52.7.4 came in a zip file with no installer.  I mention this because I'm wondering whether it may not be the cause of the fact that I cannot get this version of Firefox to open files with the maff extension.  I right-click the file to ""Open With"" and select Firefox from the list, but it then simply goes into an infinite loop of showing me the Open With dialog box.  I even put Firefox.exe into the Send To folder, and the exact same thing happens. </p><p>When I downloaded Firefox_ESR_52.7.4 for my Windows 7 machine, it did come with an installer, but I cannot use it for the XP machine because it is the 64-bit version.  And for the life of me I cannot find anywhere to download ESR_52.7.4 with an installer. </p><p>Anybody out there who could shed some light on this problem? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Dandelion </p><p>P.S.:  I tried to post this question using Firefox (my extended release version) but after signing in, the page just hangs... and hangs.  I suppose this is because I'm using a version of Firefox which Mozilla deems unacceptably outdated.  But my argument has been and always will be that there are extensions I cannot live without, so as long as the newer versions of Firefox do not support those extensions, tant pis.

Looking into the bug that this is potentially attached to I found this information ( <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1652912"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1652912</a> ) :  Having NS_FaultTolerantHeap::APIHook_RtlFreeHeap in the crashing stack means Fault Tolerant Heap (= FTH) has been enabled for firefox.exe. FTH is automatically activated when Windows OS detects some heap-related issue which it thinks can be mitigated by FTH such as double free. This crash means Firefox crashed due to some heap related issue earlier, which enabled FTH, but probably FTH was not be able to mitigate the heap issue.  First of all, can you check FTH is activated for firefox.exe through event viewer?  1.	Open Event Viewer from Start menu (or, run eventvwr from command prompt)  2.	In the left pane of Event Viewer, go to Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Fault-Tolerant-Heap &gt; Operational  3.	If FTH is activated for firefox.exe, you'll find Event ID 1003 as the attached screenshot.  If FTH is activated, instead of looking into this crash, we need to investigate the original heap issue without FTH. You can disable FTH by stopping Diagnostic Policy Service. Can you do the following steps to send us a crash report without FTH?  1.	Open Command prompt as Administrator  2.	Run ""net stop dps""  3.	Open Firefox and follow the steps causing the tab crash  4.	Send a crash report  5.	Go back to the command prompt and run ""net start dps"" to re-enable the service  This may be caused by a third-party application. Given that 99.26% of the crashes of this signature involves AccessibleHandler.dll, do you use a screen reader or some accessibility related application?  If it is related to a screen reader, you may have to use Chrome for the time being until you can get more assistance :( </p><p>You gave me this instruction: 2.	In the left pane of Event Viewer, go to Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Fault-Tolerant-Heap &gt; Operational  Two issues I had:  On a screen reader, I have no idea which is ""left column"" and ""right column"" since to a large extent a screen reader is rather ""divorced"" from the physical layout that sighted people see on the screen (I am totally blind and don't even have a monitor nor mouse running on this machine).  Then, I found application and services log... but I did not find anywhere Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Fault-Tolerant-Heap &gt; Operational  I had Microsoft &gt; and several things with Windows but nothing about fault tolerance. When I went on to your second request: 1.	Open Command prompt as Administrator  2.	Run ""net stop dps""  3.	Open Firefox and follow the steps causing the tab crash  4.	Send a crash report  5.	Go back to the command prompt and run ""net start dps"" to re-enable the service  </p><p>When I did step 2 as Administrator as you asked, I got the error message that Windows cannot find ""net stop dps .  I tried the command both with and without the quotation marks and got the same error message.   Please remember that the Windows 10 on my computer is the HOME version, not the Windows PROFESSIONAL VERSION with all the security stuff found on that version and used in office environments.   From a practical standpoint, unless you folk have another suggestion, it appears that i will likely have to GIVE UP ON FIREFOX (remembering from your message that most of these particular crashes result from an issue with Firefox working with screen readers) until a time comes when Firefox might be updated to resolve issues between Firefox and screen readers.  I believe I will contact Vispero, the publisher of JAWS, to let them know about the problem I am having with all these crashes in the current version of Firefox. Of course, I am open to try any other suggestions to further diagnose the problem, if I can carry them out with speech and NO SIGHTED HELP. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;windows-10;bug_1;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1336317;,knobman

I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 10 x64. I am quite good in informatics. The specs of the hardware are very good, it has 16 GB ram and SSD. The problem is that Firefox is very sluggish every other time I restart the PC. I use only a few add-ons and plugins. When I restart in safe mode, it still supersluggish. For instance, I play speed chess online and I lose because the animation is not moving, the chessboard freezes. It takes like half a minute to open Gmail and start a new email. To open anything, it takes ages. It takes ages to respond to a click on a webpage. Restarting the PC normally resolves the problem. I have Avast antivirus, Zonealarm firewall and I regularly run spyware scan too.  My drivers are up-to-date. The laptop works well otherwise. Even when Firefox becomes sluggish, the overall RAM and CPU usage is below 20%. My internet is 100 Mbit/s, wireless. </p><p>I already refreshed and reinstalled Firefox. No help.

When I click on the firefox icon on my bottom taskbar, firefox loads with all my tabs, but only with a very small window, I can't get it bigger.  When i hit f11 to go full screen, I can see all my top tabs, but the bottom task bar disappears.  The little boxes in the top right to maximize screen are there, but when I hit that icon, firefox shrinks and those boxes to maximize the screen disappear.  If I right click when in the small window, there is no option to maximize.  I have restarted several times, did not work.  I have most recent version of firefox and windows 10, which I use on my laptop.  This is a firefox problem, as it does not happen in chrome, but I prefer firefox as my default browser.   I have now spent 3 hours trying all the fixes on the support web site, but it seems I have a choice to either see firefox full screen without bottom taskbar or in a small box that is useless for me.  I also had the problem of the top tabs disappearing, but I seem to have fixed that.  I really need help!  I could not even get a good screen shot when firefox is just the little box.  I don't know if it is related, but my icons on my desktop also disappeared, but that is probably a windows problem.

All of the issues (at least those I've discovered so far) are noted on the attached image, so there's little point in repeating them here.  The greatest problems are with new windows: issues A and B make new windows almost useless (without a lot of extra effort to work around the issues), and the fact that I can no longer add more tabs to a new window is simply intolerable.  (If I attempt adding a tab, it somehow ""locks"" the window, and it cannot be exited or deleted without taking down Firefox.)  The second problem is that at least some menu items in the ""original"" window(s) from the previous version no longer work correctly, if at all.  The latter ""if at all"" (Tools|Page Info) is something I heavily depend upon because other browsers don't have such a tool.  (I have not tried all of the other Tools to see if they misbehave, too.)  To me, it's all part of what makes ""full-featured Firefox"" better than ""crippled Chrome"" (which touts speed but deliberately, for the sake of that speed, has restricted its features compared to Firefox).  Unfortunately, there is no option in the ""Help"" dropdown to try reloading and reinstalling the current version (to see if that will fix the problems), so I'm stuck. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1335555;1335754;1335773;,harveyh

I use SwissCows as the search engine and the problem I encountered was that when I would click on one of the search results, it would open the link in a new tab. As one may imagine, this would get confusing quickly. To fix the issue, I went into advanced preferences and adjusted <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow</strong> and <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction</strong> values to 1 and 0 respectively. It fixed that problem, but now I have a new problem.

I figured maybe one thing was fine until I realized that Widevine actually did some bad stuff to your OS, since it needs to access the internal OS to block screenshots and screen recordings. Today, I discovered that geolocation also uses Google servers, and in the process of turning it off I also discovered that there is this ""Safe Browsing"" that also uses Google. Looking even further, even some of the privacy things redirect to Google. I haven't even mentioned that the default search engine is Google. Even if Google paid you to make them the default, you could create a prompt on the first launch asking for search engine, with Google selected by default but another search engine (like DDG) recommended. All of this Google software is likely sucking on our data. </p><p>Now while writing this post, I noticed something even worse. Why are Google servers on the filter whitelists? This is uncool. I understand, maybe your website needs to detect Firefox to function correctly, and antifingerprint would break it. But WHY GOOGLE? All of this seems to be going against the goal of privacy. How are you supposed to expect a random person to go directly to about:add-ons, disable Google Widevine, go to about:preferences, disable safe browsing, go to about:config, enter the ""danger"" zone confidently, and delete Google from the 10,000 times it appears in the config? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1336036;1336462;1336485;,matthew34
