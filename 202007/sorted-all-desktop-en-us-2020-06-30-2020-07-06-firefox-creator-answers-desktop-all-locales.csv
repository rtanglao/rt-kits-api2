I would click on my bookmarks or type in the URL and nothing would come up. It refused to even attempt to get on the page, nothing would come up. The page would be blank. My extensions weren't working, either, and some websites had logged me out. So the solution I found via Support was to do a Refresh.  I did that and everything worked great again. My bookmarks and tabs were saved, I just had to fiddle with my extensions and theme.  Now, only a week later, Firefox is having the same problem. Websites not loading, extensions not working. I'm using the latest version on Windows 10, so that can't be the issue. Do I just Refresh and hope it doesn't happen a third time? Doing a weekly Refresh would be such a nightmare.  I love Firefox, especially because of the extensions, but that's the only thing I can think of that's causing this issue.

When I opened up Messenger on the same platform again a few hours later, I notice that it said ""son of a boss"" instead. I checked Messenger on my phone, and it didn't change the word there. The same thing occurs on my Reddit account sometimes too, where similar swears are replaced with ""boss"".

With a web site displayed like cnn.com where there is a link at the top (CNN logo) there is a problem when a drop-down list of bookmarks covers that logo/link.  When I click on a bookmark with the Surface pen, the click event goes instead to the page ""underneath"" the drop-down list and I go zooming off to that link instead of to the bookmarked link that I want. I see this when using the Surface pen, not with a conventional mouse.  The tablet is running in normal screen mode, not in tablet mode.

It goes from 2.4GB (system only usage) to 5.0GB and does not drop after closing tabs. However when I open 10-20 tabs again RAM usage does not rise (maybe slightly, like 5.3GB). So it looks like firefox has multiple tabs stored in ram and opening new tabs just rewrites that memory instead of allocating new one. I have 8GB of ram so 3GB of usage from 1 open tab is crazy.

I have many different bookmarks in Firefox so I'd rather not switch over to Safari unless absolutely necessary. Nothing else is missing, so I doubt if I've been hacked. I did check a bank account, which was fine. I'm not a high profile person, so I doubt if I've been targeted. And I see the pic of the lock closed in the URL bar constantly.
