I just want Firefox to display webpages ""normally"", i.e. with black text, without regard to the current system colors. </p><p>To reproduce: - Turn on High Contrast - Visit a site such as <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ppois.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ppois.html</a> - Change system High Contrast text color to any color you wish - Notice that the text on the page also changes to the same color, even with the setting on ""Never"" </p><p>Is there any way I can get Firefox to ignore the system's text color settings?

I screenshotted it because I thought firefox would crash before I could copy them all. If needed, I can paste them one by one. </p><p>I downloaded Chrome, which I'm using right now and it isn't crashing like firefox. However, when I had firefox open at the same time, firefox crashed and caused Chrome to crash as well..  </p><p>Any help is appreciated. I prefer to continue using firefox because I'm used to it and it has all my saved passwords.

Sessionstore encodig recovery.,"<p>Somehow the sessionstore just showed a blank tab, but (if opened with a text editor) the sessionstore file containts the complete session (even the latest tabs) but its not possible to recover from that. If you for example open 5 tabs and then close firefox (and wait 2 minutes and check in the task-manager that its closed) and then deleting everything in the 'sessionstore-backups' folder and then starting firefox, then the 5 tabs are there again. I have made backups the moment firefox was not working anymore, but firefox seems to anyhow not load them (have multiple recovery files saved after first problems, instantly). I got the folder from about:support 'open directory' but i'm using Linux (Linux Mint 19 - Firefox 77.0.1). Maybe sessions are saved elsewhere? Firefox even inreased the data inside of them by the new 5 Tabs, so they grow in size, and if you opened it in a text editor you could search the new tabs even, as far as i remember from yesterday. Then i don't remember the order of two things from yesterday: </p><p><br> 1. I moved some recently 'changed' files from the profile folder and then move them back (i wanted to backup, but i moved and the problem was somehow firefox was starting at the same time, it was a mistake, and then i had trouble not knowing if the preferences are still the same, and since i updated from i think 64 to 77.0.1 (i have a list of important changes) some where different, for example i would never have geolocation enabled. but others like the deleted pocket links (in about:config) are still the way they are, so i wonder. and i had multiple files in the moment </p><p><br> 2. the sessionstore now is little (5 tabs probably), i tried to delete session store very often, i dont know if it was after this? but probably. But like i said i don't remember it. </p><p><br> </p><p>But now the new problem. The History and Book marks file does not work, i moved them away or deleted them (of course backup before that) because this was an online tip, but the restoring thing just worked for the bookmarks, and just something between i think 1-3 days ago. </p><p><br> The problem now is i can't recover ANYTHING anymore. I can not really read the recovery file with a text editor, many letters are red, with the linux text editor, it says translated something like ""some symbols don't work, please choose encoding"" and there are many: </p><p>UTF-8 Central European (WINDOWS-1250) Unicode (UTF-16) Western (IBM-850) Unicode (UTF-7) ... </p><p>Over 50 different probably. Some even crash the program, what is the encoding for the recovery file? </p><p>There needs to be an Extension that is able to import and read broken sessionstore files, and 'places' files. </p><p><br> Probably i was to greedy, but i made stupid mistake accidently. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lonasethu.jw

If I want to sign in to a specific site automatically while still generally deleting cookies when I turn off Firefox, then I need to list all the cookies used by that site in Manage Permissions as Allow.

Today I wanted to preserve cookies from a major newspaper, but I find at least five domain names in the cookies that I have to protect in order to enable auto sign-in for that one site. My suggestion is that there be some improved method for easily 'transfering' (rather than writing down and re-keying) selected cookie domains from Manage Data to Manage Permissions, instead of having to rekey them and make errors doing that. If I want to auto sign-in to 15 sites, but keep the controls set for deleting unprotected cookies when closing Firefox, I would have to enter perhaps 75 domains by hand. An alternative might be a column in Manage Cookies whereby I could check mark a cookie, thereby transfering it to show in Manage Permissions, perhaps as defaulting to Allow for Session. Then I could review them and if desired switch each to Allow. </p>",cookies;firefox-780;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",Quenchoo

A few days back, after reorganizing my bookmarks, I noticed these changes did not sync to my other computers. I followed the recommendations for [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1219438"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1219438</a>] <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1219438"" rel=""nofollow"">deleting certain files to restart the sync</a>, a recommendation to create new accounts, and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1294263"" rel=""nofollow"">reinstalling Firefox</a>. None of these worked. What did work was: </p><p>1. I backed up my bookmarks to both html and json, just in case.  2. I uninstalled Firefox completely, on two of my three computers, then reinstalled. 3. I created a new account. While this is not necessary, I discovered Firefox does allow Gmail's <a href=""https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/12/19/gmail-email-address-tricks/"" rel=""nofollow"">email address tricks</a>  after a plus sign (example: firefox+randomword (at) <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>). I've been doing this more and more for extra security so a hacker can't use my regular email as a starting point. 4. With all computers logged in, I imported my bookmarks and synced. This solved the bookmark issues. But I've lost my history. I logged into my old account to discover my history was erased as expected. Searching for a solution turned up a Windows tool, but also a mention to import to another browser from which to import into my new account. I downloaded Opera and imported my history locally.  5. In Firefox, logged into my new account, I prepared to import my browsing history back into the new account. Lo and behold, a Firefox pop-up asked if I wanted to merge my old Firefox account sync data into my new account. I did, and everything worked-meaning I did not have to import from Opera. </p><p>For admins: It's great there was a tool to allow me to cross import/merge accounts.

I never had any problems with it until now. It is this baffling sound issue. Firefox will not play any sound. At first I noticed that some adds on Youtube videos were without sound but I took no action. Yesterday I noticed that no sound will play on Firefox browser. I have no issues with my sound card or audio issues of any kind. Google Chrome plays sounds normally, as well as the Edge, this issue is only when I use Mozilla Firefox.  I spent most of the time yesterday and today on trying to solve this issue but with no success. I tried every solution i could find on the internet but no joy. Firefox just don't play any sounds.  As Firefox is my preferred, default web browser this thing is especially frustrating.  Does anybody have a solution for this problem? Please help!

I have tried both and both give me the same problem. The 'radio' buttons become unusable on the site and I cannot click on them anymore (such as the Publish button, for example).  So I am unable to save any of my work and must just shut down. I have also tried do nothing and this just freezes everything.  </p><p>This is very very frustrating and counterproductive.

And I am hoping someone can offer a solution, even if it is to tell me I am doing it wrong. </p><p>It seems like others would have a similar problem, and it is sort of difficult to explain, although I'd think there would be a simple solution. Anyway, let me try to explain... </p><p>When I use the autofill option, it is usually while placing an order, or filling out my account details for whatever shopping site, or gaming profile, etc.  But I have multiple addresses I need to consider when I am shopping, and need to send the order to one or the other, instead of my regular address.  Like placing an order that I want sent to my mother's address. </p><p>As anyone knows, when you change something, like the address, state, zip or phone number, you end up with several autofill entries. Like this... </p><p>First Name, Last Name (My primary info, but I can't see it in the pop-up) First Name, Last Name (My primary info, but my work address, which I also don't see) First Name, Last NAME First Name, Last Name FIRST NAME, Last Name First Name, Last Name </p><p>These pop up, all valid options, the next time you start filling out a form.  Which is great, because ONE of them is the one you would like to use, but there is no way to see WHICH one points to the one you need.  The first one is my normal address, phone, etc, but the autofill pop up doesn't show you anything other than the name, the second is my work, but I can't see that it is... only the name. The third might be my mom's address, but again, I have no idea because only my name is shown...etc etc etc. </p><p>Is there a better autofill plugin out there, one that lets you label them? Or some way to show more than just the name? Just showing me the same name 12 times, without any way to know what the right one to use is, kinda makes the autofill feature useless for me.  If I only had one phone, or one address, etc, the feature would work great.  But since I have about a dozen addresses I routinely use, each with their own unique state or zipcode, or phone number, has rendered autofill useless unless I only need the common ""top"" one. </p><p>I hope I've made it clear what the problem is.  And no, using a unique firefox profile for each is not the answer.  I'd have to log out/off firefox and switch profiles several times in one shopping or gaming session, which would only make the solution highly annoying. </p><p>It would be nice to find a plugin, or any other solution, that would let me label, or differentiate each from the other when the autofill pop-up gives me the option to fill the form. </p><p>Like... Home - First Name, Last Name Work - First Name, Last Name Mom's - First Name, Last Name Gary's - First Name, Last Name </p><p>Anyone have a solution, or feel my pain? Or am I simply doing it wrong? </p><p>ANY help is greatly appreciated. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-780;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1332082;1332084;,Lawtonwestberry

I thought it might be a issue on google's side, but this has been a persistent issue for at least a month.   </p><p>Also I go into google chrome and do the exact same steps, exact same file and it downloads easily.

The cookie is back.  If I ""Manage Permissions..."" and block yahoo from creating a cookie,  it consistently loads on first run,  but then I'm constantly hit with yahoo first run banners, etc. that do nothing because each time it loads it has no cookie. </p><p>I'm really interested if this is a firefox issue, or a yahoo issue.

I have spent over $200 to get technical support on my laptop because I thought it was a windows problem. They couldn't fix it. I told them that I was able to use Pinterest for years and they answered me that it has to do with new updates on Firefox because an older version of firefox seemed to work and that certain algorithm's must have been changed.

As the default security settings of Outlook software prevents a number of scripts from running, it is common to be unable to view an HTML email as the sender intended, even if one “downloads pictures”, and so Outlook displays an advisory on these emails; “If there are problems with how this message is displayed, click here to view it in a web browser”.  If I click on this, the email will open in Internet Explorer (IE) and I will be able to view the email as intended. </p><p>I want to open these emails automatically in Firefox (FF) but, despite searching the web for a solution, I cannot see how to do this.  My default web browser is set as FF and everything web related other than Outlook emails successfully opens in FF.  I see that the Outlook emails are saved thus: C:\Users\<em>MyUserName</em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\<em>UniqueID</em>\email.mht.  I have searched how to open mht files in FF and have accordingly downloaded the <strong>Web Archives</strong> Extension.  Unfortunately, even with Web Archives installed, when I try to open the cached mht file in FF, the file will not open.  I also tried to change the default application by file type of .mht and .mhtml files from IE to FF but Windows will not offer FF as an alternative program for these files types. </p><p>Please could someone advise what I should do so that if I need to view an email in Outlook in a browser, the email will open, and successfully render, in FF? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-780;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1331634;,ross01

Mozilla is using the old operator error routine we hear so often when a company can’t be bothered to help a customer. Now I am faced with $50 an hour to have a TRUSTED computer repair person to sort this out. Don’t ever ask Mozilla for help, their uneducated robot will just say it’s your problem. Perhaps I should have just stayed with Google Chrome, at least they tried to give an intelligent answer and not give up on their customer and blame the customer for the problem. I think this is on page 35 of the Mozilla customer service manual. When you don’t know the answer just blame the user and move on to a simpler question.  An uneducated answer is better than no answer at all. Let the user pay someone to fix the problem caused by Mozilla.

After I close and then re-open Firefox, however, the home page goes back to being un-themed, despite (as far as I can tell) everything else that should be affected by the theme still being themed. I am using the official dark theme that comes with the browser, and the only extensions that I have that should affect it are Dark Reader and Firefox Color, though the problem still occurs with them disabled. My other extensions are listed in the ""Installed Plugins"" part.  The issue seems to happen on both Kubuntu and Windows. Thank you for reading. EDIT: I tried without Color, and it worked. I think it was applying an old theme I made on Color that looked like the dark theme but with a white start page.

Most are lined out and a few are not (depends on the page). Then the pop up window goes away.  </p><p><strong>First issue:</strong> How do you make that pop up stay open so that you can read the information it is displaying? How can you recall the pop up, if you need to? What does lined out mean vs. not lined out? Obviously, I can take a guess here but it would be nice to have an official reference or explanation. </p><p><strong>Second Issue:</strong> I would expect that the Safe Protection Dashboard would be in agreement with the info displayed in that tracker pop up window. It does not. Open a URL, the tracker pop up window opens and lists, for example: 8 trackers, 6 of which are lined out, 2 are not. Go to the Safe Protection dashboard and it ALWAYS says ""<em>No trackers know to Firefox were detected on this page.</em>""   --&gt; Well, something ain't right here. These two tracker status indicators should be in agreement. And, just in case, they don't have to be in agreement, then there should be some explanation as to why there are different results. </p><p>Thank you for a great product and the attention to detail. </p>",other;firefox-780;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",plrfl

I have the same issue when I try doing it via Chat out of my Gmail account. </p><p>What happens is that when I execute to dial the number, the dialer pops up and instantly closes, and the call does not go through. That dialer will not stay open, and it must forthe call to work. This happens whether I try to use it online from <a href=""https://hangouts.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hangouts.google.com/</a> or out of a Gmail e-mail account via Google Chat, which is included in the e-mail account. </p><p>I prefer to use Firefox rather than Google Chrome. But in testing, I find I can make outgoing calls from Chrome. </p><p>Once in a while, this works. In my Google search, I did find one assertion that it no longer will work out of Firefox because Firefox has stopped supporting plug ins (I had no idea -- then Flash also should not work, but it does, I can watch flash videos, so I'm doubtful plugin support is the issue). </p><p>Yet, I do find that Firefox actually offers a Google Hangouts add on! I don't see how that could be if it can't be supported for lack of a plugin. I installed that, closed and reopened Firefox, and tried to dial out of it. Same problem, dialer flashed open and closed, it did not dial out. </p><p>Again, I note, sometimes, rarely it seems, it will work. It should not do even that if it requires a plugin that is not there. I didn't see anything in settings that I would expect could be related. </p><p>I also note, I have tested it on a Windows 10 laptop, again out of the current Firefox, and same issue. So it doesn't appear the problem is necessarily linked to my Mac, its linked to Firefox.

If I then clicked on the download button, it would be saved in my downloads folder, and clicking the saved file in Firefox's download links would open it in my default PDF viewer (ie Acrobat). This allowed me to easily look at PDF files without cluttering up Firefox's downloads list, as well as quickly open a downloaded PDF in Acrobat. </p><p>Following a recent update to Firefox, these options seem to have been changed and I can't find a way to revert to the previous behaviour. It seems to be treating the in-browser function as a full PDF viewer, rather than a preview. I can set Firefox to open PDFs in Acrobat, but then it downloads every link I click on which happens to be a PDF and opens them all in Acrobat. Or I can tell it to open them in the browser, but then if I want to open a PDF in Acrobat I have to download it, then hunt for it in my downloads folder and open it there rather than directly in Firefox. It also clutters up my downloads list, making it harder to find slightly older downloads without going through file explorer. </p><p>Alternatively, I can tell Firefox to ask me what to do every time. This is a bit better (a new option ""open with firefox"" has been added), but still involves making a couple of extra clicks each time I open a PDF - and it still insists on downloading every PDF based link I click. </p><p>What makes this particularly strange is that the in-browser PDF viewer still has a ""download"" button, which has the traditional two ""open with___""/""save file"" options, even though as far as I can tell it will only display stuff it's already downloaded. </p><p>Is it possible to return to Firefox's previous behaviour, or is it gone for good? </p>",firefox-780;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",pi4toid

I have very few sites where ABP allows ads. I have Bitdefender for antivirus. I have reset Firefox at least 5 times this past 6 weeks.  This has gotten old. I have tried starting without the Add-ons, but what's the sense of having Add-ons available then? If I try to use Firefox with the autoplay feature for videos on sites like <a href=""http://NFL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">NFL.com</a> or <a href=""http://NASCAR.com"" rel=""nofollow"">NASCAR.com</a>, Firefox will in short time crash (Firefox is not responding), ..usually when I have more than 2 tabs open, but has done it with a singular tab open.  As a matter of fact, it will sometimes crash before loading the page. If I use FIrefox with autoplay disabled, I can't even prompt the video to play.  It doesn't even show up in the play section when prompted.   So what's the sense of that? After resetting Firefox, I fail to understand why in the most viewed panel, why my most viewed aren't there after each reset?  Also, why doesn't it populate my most viewed consistently?  That being, if I go to the same sites all the time, why don't they show as most viewed?  I get sites showing up I've only been to once in a month, instead of multiple times in a day. My final thing...why does Edge keep prompting me to install it while using Firefox?  I have Edge already installed when Firefox crashes and it has a fresh install from just 2 weeks ago.  But I still get these annoying notifications. I know this is long, but this is what happens when you try diligently to do as the instructions show in the Help section multiple times...only to come to the same conclusion. Can someone please help? </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1330622;1330628;1330629;1330636;1330660;,Highhorse
