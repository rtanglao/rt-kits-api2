It discolours my screen and I'm unable to do anything on the pc unless I reset it by holding the power button. Sometimes my curser completely disappears and other times it becomes a jumbled mess but i can still move it. I have two monitors and it only discolours the one firefox is open in, which has happened to both monitors on seperate occasions. It has never discoloured both monitors at the same time.  </p><p>Initially thinking this wasn't firefox, I double checked all drivers and scanned my PC with Bitdefender. Then just completley reinstalled windows 10. Monitoring my pc, most compenents sit around 30c and none are even close to having 100% usage when crashes occur. I've stress tested my pc and double checked every cord in my setup (all internal pc connections, power and display cords)  </p><p>The crashes mostly happen on Twitch and Youtube, as that's what I mainly use. Though they have occured on other websites as well. I've tried disabling hardware acceleration on firefox and limiting the content process to 3. I have 4 extensions enabled, ClearURLs, Decentraleyes, HTTPS Everywhere and uBlock Origin. All off which have the firefox reccomended trophy thing.  </p><p>I'm at a loss now and have no idea what else to try. I'm still not even 100% sure it's firefox, as it seems like a graphics card problem. Though I've stress tested and left it for hours and no crashes. No crashes in the hundreds of hours of gaming I've done either. My PC has only ever crashed while using firefox.  </p><p>The last two tests that I can think of would be disabling all extensions or just trying a different browser and seeing what happens.  </p><p>The crashes vary from multiple times per day to like once or twice a month, so any suggestions might take a while for me to test and reply with results.  </p><p>Cheers </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1333290;1333291;,baileyn14

The only places I can see to grab the window without accidentally opening tabs or dragging the tab off the tab bar into a new window are at each far end of the tab bar. So you have to decide which way you want to move the window and choose the appropriate end of the tab bar. Compared to Chrome, the FF tab bar is really skinny - even though the difference is only about 1/16 or 1/8 inch, that small difference is enough in Chrome to grab the window where you want and drag it without opening the tab right below where you're grabbing.
