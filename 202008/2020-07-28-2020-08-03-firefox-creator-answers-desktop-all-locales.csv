I recently updated from v.69.0.1 to v.78.0.2. But the newer version installed in a different folder and now I can run both versions. Yesterday I had the v.69 working with around 500 tabs open. Suddenly it crashed and then freezed. Luckily, I had managed to save my current working session by accessing Tab Session Manager addon. But when I go to Tab Manager Session and click to open this saved session, FF v.69 will keep freezing, no matter what I do. (Tab Session Manager has another option „Export”, but I don't know to use it or what it does.) I will quit using FF v.69. But how can I get the new v.78 to open this 500-tab session? Any help is appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nicolae.lucian

Other times my whole screen just goes blank before I have a chance to do anything and then the blue screen. This does not happen with Chrome or Edge. These are 100% repeatable. ALWAYS with Firefox, NEVER with Chrome or Edge. Blue screen logs show errors related to atikmpag.sys (my graphics driver) and dxgkrnl.sys (DirectX). I checked for a graphics driver update; there was none. So I uninstalled and reinstalled using a fresh download from the motherboard manufacturer's website (using embedded graphics, no discreet GPU in this system). Did not solve the issue. I don't recall what version of Firefox I was using, but I updated to 79.0 and also tried ESR. No change. Ran Mozilla's recommended refresh procedure which removes extensions and resets settings. No change. Booted Windows into Safe Mode and the problem does NOT occur. When I booted back into normal mode, I uninstalled the graphics driver again and tried with default settings -- problem doesn't happen! </p><p>While this appears to be an issue with the graphics driver, it only happens in FF, so there seems to be an issue with the two interacting.  The latest Firefox crash report listed in about:crashes is from November 2019, long before this issue was discovered.  I assume that because the whole computer is crashing with a BSOD, FF doesn't register the crash. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-790;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1338573;1338574;1338605;1338621;,kosmicken

I arrange them in order when researching something. So, there's 20 tabs open, 4 different categories of the subject topic. There has to be a way besides a sidebar, to signify fast which group starts where. Best case scenario would be marking the 1st tab of a group with a flag, or static pop-up - a short, 15 character-limit description to signify which group it is (like '4k', '1080p', '720p', for video resolution values). 2nd-best would be a mouse-hover message, i.e. a flag or balloon to pop-up with the 15-character description. Finally, I could color-code the 1st tab of a group, or even the text .I saw some good extensions that did these - looks like Firefox disabled them with the latest browser upgrade.

Again, no option to set a hotkey to open up the Home Page. </p><p>Then I did more searching and I found various extensions that will open up the Home Page in a new tab.  Not what I want, ideally, but I had a look at the extensions anyway.  Unfortunately, you can't use a hotkey to open up the tab to that specific Home Page.  It just goes to the Home Page automatically when you open up a new tab.  You don't use a shortcut.  This is problematic because I already have my new tab set to a different website, and I don't want to replace that website with the Home Page.  I want to keep the same website for new tabs, and just open up a freaking Home Page using a shortcut. </p><p>Firefox has really gotten stupid ever since Quantum.

I was able to login to the Disk Station Locally using the Local Network IP I had assigned to it, and also able log in via the registered Domain through Synology with a Secure Connection using either method when logging in.  Everything worked perfectly. Over a year ago I had some issues with my network (it has been too long ago for me to remember what it was).  I could not resolve it, so when I called Netgear Tech Support they had me reset my router to factory settings.  This did fix the issue I was having, but I later noticed resetting had changed my IP address.  I thought this was not a problem at the time. It was then I also noticed I was no longer getting a Secure Connection on through my Disk Station. Have been trying to resolve this on my own, but I am not having any luck.  But I am learning as I go. Present Day –  I am still having issues logging in.   The message I get when I log into the Synology registered Domain with Firefox is ""Unable to Connect"".  I tried Chrome and get a similar message. When I log in locally using the assigned IP address I get ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"". </p><pre>I click on the ""Advanced"" button where Firefox displays the Error Message:  SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN.

Weather that is the one that is used for this connection I am speaking of, I do not know. --  The Certificate is current and has not expired. My apologies for this description being lengthy, I just want to make sure I state everything I can think of in order to get this fixed.

I've typed this password at least several times before (with success) so I was sure that I remember it correctly. Fortunately I had it on the paper. I checked it - and I realized, that I remembered it correctly. So I tried once again but I failed. I tried few times with the same result. I had the same password also for different site. So I logged on that site - with success. So my keyboard seems to work correctly. I didn't change master password in Firefox. At least I am not aware of that. It was unchanged for whole period I used this feature, as I wrote it wasn't long. Fortunately I have all important passwords saved on the paper so I decided to reset my Firefox Master password. It is possible that I've lost less important passwords but I can reset them because I still have access to my most important data. I do not need any help. And I am aware that I could made mistake of any type. But I decided to report that because there is also a chance that this is Firefox error so you should be aware of my case. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;windows-10;masterpassword;firefox-790;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",artur.a.sakowski

So I tried copying and pasting the saved profiles back into the new Mozilla Roaming and Local profiles, but I can't get Firefox to access them.  Instead, it only accesses the new profile. I did an uninstall and tried it again, but all I ended up doing is creating another new profile. Now when I go to About:Profiles (see image), the default-release and default profiles listed don't seem to exist anymore (they aren't loadable, and they can't be found using the filepath noted there), and the actual backup profiles that I copied from my portable drive into Mozilla and that I actually see in File Explorer, doesn't show up as a profile choice.

Ran across a few articles that Firefox 79 change something with sync but don't understand exactly what they're talking about why this would affect this installation, so I then looked at  the versions installed on each system, my main system is running Firefox 78 or I should say was running Firefox 78 I thought upgrading it to 79 would fix the issue so I did and that did not work. in the meantime I proceeded to uninstall Firefox 79 on the second machine that refuses to sync the add-ons and replace it with Firefox 78, during this process I removed all Firefox entries related to profiles installs updates etc. I tried to wipe every mention of Firefox on the machine as if it never have Firefox installed on it before. Installed 78 signed in to sink expecting everything to work as normal and still nothing it's been two hours since the install I have re-synced multiple times in hopes of getting it to work with no success it appears to sync everything but the add-ons, and yes I have add-ons on the sync list on all computers have double triple and quadruple checked that to make sure . I really don't want to have to manually run from computer to computer to figure out what add-ons I have and all the settings of each one to make it perfect because I have had issues in the past of installing an add-on on one machine and the settings being different on another causing issues between the add-ons would appreciate if somebody could tell me how why or what the hell I'm supposed to do here to make Firefox think actually work again the way it had worked for years I really need these computers identical in every way as i am disabled and have mobility issues such related to all be installing and uninstalling. Thanks for your help in this matter and I'll do my best to answer any questions to help you guys figure this out. Also I'm not even remotely familiar how to file bug reports or anything else so somebody wants to suggest that I would appreciated if they are able to do it on my behalf and I will give them all the information so it's done properly. Thanks againI just noticed that there's troubleshooting information able to be shared this information is being shared from the computer that works absolutely perfect and is the computer I want to sync from below if somebody wants to explain to me how I can get that data and add it to this post so you guys can compare and figure out what the heck the problem is I will do it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",hillvalleyfarms

My old laptop died the other day and so I bought a new one and put my old drive in an enclosure.  I had my Firefox heavily customised (over the past eight years) and I don't know how to transfer it over.  It used to be that I would just copy the users over and everything would be cool (XP to W7 didn't give me this problem) but it's not working this time.  My guess is that it's because my old laptop used Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  My desktop monster uses Windows 10 Pro but this new laptop uses Windows 10 Home (which is just awful compared to Pro) so there's probably an issue with how the user profiles are handled.  I didn't have a Firefox account because I didn't want every machine I use to have the same Firefox setup.  This was because my desktop and laptop are used for different purposes entirely. </p><p>Does anyone know how to import the settings from a Windows 7 profile to a Windows 10 profile?

I know this isn't the first time you've heard this... I've been fighting with this master password issue since the middle of July and I've exhausted all the options I'm aware of. I have tried to reset my password several times but the """"Master Password Box """"  keeps popping up (even while typing this) and none of my previous nor current passwords open it and it's required before i can login to access any of my data and passwords etc.. Which i do not know what the password is anymore. I did know it bc i typed it in several times a day.... either Microsoft update or Mozz update happened and that password is useless now and i can not afford to lose this information!!! As stated, I'm losing biz as i type PLUS i can't pay my bills until I get back into my data. My IPhone and iPad and other devices are all caught up in this mess as well. I feel absolutely hopeless! One would think if you donate several hundred $ a year to Mozz and you'd think there would be some sort priority support for Donors.  My other devices can't sign in either... Ive tried most everything I've seen in support and nothing seems to work. I feel as though the more i mess with it the deeper I'm sinking! I have a back up that is from 2018 which gaps the last 2 years of data and PW.. I Still have my old recovery key password that didn't work in the beginning when all of this happened, nor does windows master password work. I have everything backed up on a hard drive as well but I haven't gone down that road yet.

It's really glitchy sometimes; either it doesn't show up at all, then I have to manually copy paste my login data, or it moves around on the page when I scroll down, open up the keyboard etc. </p><p>So I thought, why not use Google's autofill, the feature I've always loved, because it works just perfectly, on Firefox instead. Did that on my tablet and mobile phone, as luckily you can select your autofill provider on Android. Sadly there's no option on Firefox so far (or I missed it, I quickly went through about:config but couldn't find anything there as well)... Maybe there's some hidden option or a safe addon that lets me do that? </p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated!

I also can't tell if there is one sole cause of all of these issues or several, but please do your best to explain what's going on. </p><p>1-2 months ago, some strange things started happening with my computer repeatedly. Consistently, a command prompt would open unexpectedly, saying something about Chromium failing to update. I couldn't do anything with that program, so I just X'd it out, and maybe around a minute later Firefox would crash and restart. Once that happened, my Firefox home page would be set to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a>, and the default search engine would also be changed to Yahoo!. And on my desktop, shortcuts for Internet Explorer and Chromium would be added, and the shortcut for Chromium would be automatically pinned to my taskbar. </p><p>Windows Security would then notify me that it's blocked a threat, so I'd go to check it out and remove said threat. Every time, it;d say the blocked threat makes changes to browser settings without proper permission, and the blocked threat is called ""sodecitot.exe"", located in a filepath like c:\programdata\{5b729525-380e-6a38-89c28-8402d0dace36}\sodecitot.exe (just in case it's some obscure ID, I've swapped out those numbers and letters with random numbers and letters). Then Windows Security reports ""Remediation incomplete"" on the same threat, implying it attempted to restore itself. That letter and number folder name notably follows the same format as a bunch of folders which were last modified when I first turned on this computer on January 1, 2019. </p><p>I was getting a lot of such reports from Windows Security on very similar threats, having various different letters and numbers for their folder names, and I figured it was likely malware, so I made several full scans with MSERT, Malwarebytes, Windows Security, and Windows Defender Online Scan, all to no avail. </p><p>I don't even know why Internet Explorer is installed, but its files were last modified in February 2019, so I think it's just a shortcut that was added. </p><p>I'm not sure what Chromium is or why it's installed either. I tried to look it up to learn more about it but found nothing useful, and its executable looks like a blue version of Google Chrome's logo. Some parts of Chromium's installation were last modified in October 2019, but most of its files were modified just today. </p><p>Notably as well, when these problems started happening 1-2 months ago, there were two instances of all of my desktop shortcuts having weird visual issues, one being the little arrows on the shortcuts (which indicates it's a shortcut and not an actual file) being replaced with a X's, and a separate instance where the Audacity logo was over top every other shortcut for a few minutes. </p><p>With the same events happening today, a new error message opened, saying something about Windows Explorer attempting to load the C runtime library incorrectly (screenshot included). </p><p>I also considered turning to Mozilla, Google, and/or Microsoft support when this was originally happening, but then it suddenly stopped. I had a bunch of screenshots of some of the weirder things, but since nothing was happening for a while I deleted them. Now, 1-2 months later, it's starting right back up and I don't know why. I suspect it all links back to Chromium, but I'm not sure if I can just delete its files and call it quits, because I don't know if it's supposed to be there. It seems like something by Google, but I can't even confirm that. </p><p>So yeah. Any suggestions? </p><p><br> </p><p>My computer has a Windows 10 operating system. Mozilla Firefox is installed and constantly open, used for entertainment. Google Chrome is installed and constantly open, used for work. Apparently, some part of Google Chrome's installation trips off Malwarebytes whenever I make a scan. Removing it causes Chrome to crash, and once I open it again that part is replaced. Usually, I just remove it so I don't miss any other threats, and then just restore my closed tabs. Audacity is installed and has a desktop shortcut. Internet Explorer is apparently installed, and there is no uninstall executable as far as I can tell. Whatever it is, Chromium seems to keep trying to install itself, with parts of it already existing on my computer. </p>",desktop;other;malware;escalate;windows-10;escalationresolved;firefox-780;malware78;,firefox,other,en-US,1336551;1336552;1336826;1336845;1336854;,jcclay1

After about 15 minutes of slow response times, I restarted FireFox and immediately, the page loaded very quickly as usual. </p><p>You can see the page where this was occurring at this url: <a href=""https://legacy-systems.biz/demo/demo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://legacy-systems.biz/demo/demo.html</a> </p><p>Any information etc. would be appreciated immensely. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1338541;1338544;1338586;,firefox195
