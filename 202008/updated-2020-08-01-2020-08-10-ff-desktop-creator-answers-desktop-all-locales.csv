I use the newest Firefox version 79.0 (64-Bit) on Windows 7 Pro SP1 and the extension ""Tab Session Manager"" I closed FireFay and as usual, after I restartef it, I waited for the opening of the series of my previous opened tabs. FireFax opened 117 tbs but did not fill in the URLs. They were all opened as new tabs. So I tried to open FireFox with deactivated add-ons. There it was possible to restore all the tabs. After that I closed FireFox again and opened it the usual way. It opened 116 tabs but they were all empty. I used the Add-on manager to shut down my extensions leaving only the tab session manager, AdblockPlus, NoScript. After restarting te tabs were empty again. In the list of the tab session manager I could find the sessions with 116 empty tabs (see ErrorTabSessionManager0.gif) but also the last session with the original tabs. See image ErrorTabSessionManager1.gif. I could even save this list from TabSessionManager. I updated PabSessionmanager to the newest version but that did not help. How can I get FireFox to load these previous tabs again, some of them are very important for me ? thanks for any help Jochen </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-790;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",drjomabuse

What would like to do?” with the two following options available: ""Stop it"" or ""Wait"".  If I click ""stop it"" the loading will indeed stop and I just have to refresh the page again to continue browsing normally. The troubles begin if I click ""wait"" or do nothing: the overall memory usage of Firefox will then increase seemingly exponentially and after only a few minutes the whole system will become unresponsive and I will have to hard reboot my computer or it will reboot by itself. This is extremely annoying as you can imagine as every time that happens I lose all unsaved data in the process! Strangely enough this issue sometimes even occur without any notification displayed or freeze happening in the first place: I would be browsing a few Mixcloud pages then switching to another website and after a couple of minutes I would notice that the memory usage is increasing although no Mixcloud page is open any longer... In both cases the only solution I found is to quit/force to quit Firefox as soon as possible to prevent it (and the system) to become unresponsive. Closing the application always resolves the issue and I can see the memory usage of the overall system subsequently dropping sometimes from up to 95% to 40% in the Activity Monitor app. Again I would like to stress that I have been experiencing this issue ONLY on Mixcloud and that I have no other memory related issue on my computer nor with Firefox in general."" </p><p>Mixcloud support reply at the time: ""this is linked to some issues we've been experiencing but our team are busy working on a fix for"". 10 months later nothing changed... </p><p>The same issue happened again this very morning: I opened a Mixcloud link from google results and even though I immediately closed it, 5 minutes later the RAM usage was at 93% and I struggled during 10 minutes to ""force to quit"" FF as the whole computer was becoming increasingly unresponsive. I can provide a crash report from this morning but would prefer not to display it publicly. </p><p>Please investigate this leak. It is becoming more and more frustrating to deal with as the time goes by. </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-800;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",entwined2

If you double-click on the failed page, then it downloads. The thing I discovered is that when I go to my downloads folder on my hard drive, the pages actually do save most of the time, even though the download history says failed. What is troubling is that when I double-click on the ""failed"" page in the download history, it will show the page being downloaded. But when I click on the saved page in my downloads folder, then the saved web page does not look at all like the original page. Instead it looks more like a text file with some photos on the page. The page looks disorganized. If I click to save the web page again, and let it say failed in the download history (I don't double-click on the page in the download history) then the page opens normally from my downloads folder. The thing that bothers me the most is that some pages that say failed actually failed. This creates uncertainty as to whether I can trust Firefox to actually download a page without me always going to my downloads folder to check to see if the saved page is actually there. Earlier versions of Firefox did not have this issue. I like being able to open a saved page from the download history, but that cannot be done if the download history says failed.

I keep getting a blacked out screen with an ""error #3000"" message. The only known website that seems to deal with the issue comes at the problem from the idea that people are trying to access the site via <em>Chrome</em>. The few options they suggested that I can apply to my machine— clearing the cache and cookies or else using CCleaner offered no help.  </p><p>This is not consistent however, as some other twitch channels I go to work perfectly fine. It's worth noting that I was not encountering this issues with Firefox version 78.0.2, while I am currently on version 79.0, and this is the version that has brought this issue up. Should I try downgrading to the previous version and see if that helps, or what? </p><p>Does anyone else get this error message, and if you do, what did you do to fix it? The few things I could try, I already have, save for turning off the hardware acceleration, which I don't think is the problem, as if it were, I would have seen it weeks ago when this wasn't an issue. </p><p>I am including a screenshot of what I'm seeing. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marc7

Ho notato che dopo gli ultimi aggiornamenti Firefox si è allineato alla linea di Chrome e Opera, creando un problema non da poco. Il problema è che non rispetta le impostazioni header per NON memorizzare la pagina in cache. Più in particolare le pagine da me create impostano il Cache-Control a ""private,no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate,max-age=0"" ed in più imposto l'header PHP (tramite .htaccess) per non memorizzare i file tipo php, js,css,html. Aggiornando la pagina tramite l'apposito comando ""Ricarica"" il browser mantiene in memoria i file obsoleti (js e css) non aggiornando la cache come richiesto. L'unico modo per aggiornare i file è ""eliminare la cronologia del browser"". La stessa cosa accade ricaricando gli iframe. </p><p>In prevalenza facciamo delle applicazioni WEB per cui è necessario che i file siano sempre aggiornati in base alle ultime modifiche, da cui la necessità di NON memorizzare in cache.

Изменения произошли после обновления браузера. Я возмущен и намерен не стесняться в выражениях своего возмущения.  За каким хреном собачьим в свою пользу и какой кретин додумался мне навязывать в качестве  главного иной поисковый сервис и иную главную страницу, чем те, которые были назначены мной и использовались до автоматического обновления браузера?  Каким образом и почему вместо сделанного мной выбора в качестве поиска по умолчанию и в качестве домашней страницы установлен продукт Yandex LLC, который в той реализации, в какой он мне поставлен, по моему субъективному мнению является  грязной помойкой новостей, нерелевантных моим интересам,  без спроса шпионящим ресурсом,  пропагандонским сервисом, трусливо замалчивающим главные с моей точки зрения события, но зато напичканный баннерами с третьесортной рекламой и такого же сорта новостями, заодно с кучей активных ссылок на bloatware, устанавливающихся точно таким же образом, как и этот поисковый по недоразумению сервис и эта ненужная мне домашняя страница браузера по умолчанию?  Меня очень интересует, кто с больной головы на здоровую решил, что это можно делать, не спрашивая меня и моего разрешения, исходя даже из самых лучших побуждений облегчить мне задачу выбора поставщика информационных услуг? Кто, каким образом и на каком основании осуществил эту замену настроек? Повторю описание ситуации особо одаренным альтернативно.  Устанавливая браузер,  я выбрал язык английский и поисковый сервис Google. И он тоже не идеален, но это мой выбор. Я разберусь, чем мне пользоваться - не разработчики сервиса и ПО, не поставщики сервиса должны в этом разбираться и тем более что-то предпринимать слабо приспособленными для этого органами деятельности и даже не господь Б-г, а я. Спрашивается: на основании чего и каким образом  поставка обновления браузера оказывается устроенной таким интересным способом, что я, однажды прекрасным утром открывая свой браузер, снова обнаруживаю абсолютно не устраивающие меня предварительные настройки обновленного программного продукта, которые не делал ни я, ни кто либо вместо меня со стороны пользовательского интерфейса? Это что - моль от соседей залетела и занесла? Это тараканы с помойки приползли и притащили инфекцию? Если в доме подметено, то почему бы однажды не отказать себе в привычке заходить, не переобувась в чистое. Тем более - в чужом доме.  Почему бы однажды не перестать влезать без спросу, как это бывает в обыкновении определенной категории людей, и взять за хорошее правило ничего не менять в  моих настройках приобретенной мной системы, включая настройки приложения, установленные мной,  до получения такой просьбы и делать только по получении согласия на действия, после предварительного полного информирования о результатах тех действий, которые будут произведены?   Как эта простота вмешательства стала возможной и как оградить себя  от девиантного поведения?  И третий раз. Кто, каким образом  и на основании чего бесцеремонно навязывает мне то, что я не делал и не собирался делать?  И, наконец, основной вопрос - как эти девиации исключить в дальнейшем, не затрачивая личное время на перенастройки того что уже один раз настроено мной по моему выбору, не тратя время на скандальные публикации, и не прибегая к отказу от Firefox? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",yuriybabaev

Before sending it in, I created a firefox account and synced everything (with the intent to be able to get my bookmarks on a friend's desktop if needed while my laptop was in repair.) </p><p>I had only switched from chrome about six months ago, and had not made a firefox account until I was about to send it in for repair. I did not double check that this was working (beyond the fact that it synced successfully), nor did I connect a phone or other laptop, as I figured I would be getting mine back soon, and syncing things was just on the off chance I needed to get a bookmark in the week my laptop was away. </p><p>I was then told that the screen was not repairable, and that I would be getting the cost of the laptop as credit to buy a new one. NOT IDEAL. But I figured hey, I save all my files on an external anyways, can reinstall the programs I use, and can sync firefox and chrome to get my bookmarks and history back. None of my files/info was actually lost at this point. </p><p>So I did that. Got the new laptop, started reinstalling everything. </p><p>Downloaded firefox, logged in to my account to start the sync. It did not load a single bookmark, history, anything, although I had set it to save all of that, and made sure to sync and make sure everything was up-to-date before I sent my original laptop away. </p><p>So now I no longer have access to the original laptop, did not plan on this, and I can not manually export bookmarks to transfer them over. Synching firefox is my only hope for getting them back. </p><p>I've lost links to wedding planning, research articles, and several more things, and only now, when I started panicking about sync not restoring everything, have I been googling and finding articles warning that sync is should not be used as a backup. </p><p>Chrome, on the other hand, restored everything perfectly, but does not have any of the current bookmarks I'd needed and used in the past few months. Y'know, the most relevant ones I'd like to have. </p><p>What can I do now, and is there any even slight possibility someone behind the scenes as firefox can find my bookmarks/history saved on a server somewhere?

We verified that Java script was still enabled - it is. Chrome works perfectly on the same items. This situation created an unknowing error on our part, in that, trying to go back to 78.02, we ran into a compatibility issue with the profiles folder / files. Saving the profiles in 79 stamps them accordingly, and will not allow that folder to be used on 78.02. That unleashed 2 day's worth of struggle to get back to 78.02 with everything we had customized, plus our bookmarks. We found this compatibility issue very hard to crack using the FF help system, but eventually we succeeded by manually creating a ""new folder"", and copy / pasting all the files, deleting the compatibility.ini. We then invoked this default New Folder and got back to normal.  And yes, Java-based items are working normally again.  There seems to be no grumbling on the web (at least, as yet) about what we regard as a bug, but we did waste a couple of days on this, and are now carefully ""Not now""-ing the update to 79 message, until more info is available and a fix is offered. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1339134;1339177;1339189;1339196;1339219;1339233;1339242;1339300;,rnjbailey

I got some big July 2020 Cumulative Updates, Security Updates, etc. last week and installed them. They also installed something for EDGE which was a window that would not close and was forcing me to go through a bunch of windows and fill out ""activation"" info. I finally opened Windows Task Manager and ended the task to shut it down. I then tried to uninstall it but more installation was being forced onto my laptop. Finally after a few days the uninstall button was highlighted in the list of ""apps"" and I was able to uninstall it. Today I got an update on my malware protection software subscription from a different company. It restarted my laptop, which was fine, however it brought an install yet again of EDGE, but I use Mozilla Firefox faithfully and have for years. Big fan of Mozilla and I donate every year and try to participate in surveys and all that. I have Firefox in my Windows 10 settings as my default browser. Nonetheless it keeps being foisting on me. I don't know how to reach Mozilla but I suspicion I am not the only one highly annoyed by this aggressive repeat downloading stuff. What I thought I could do is start a thread in the Mozilla Community and see if enough other people are upset. Perhaps Mozilla can do something with Microsoft about this. I would think Google's Chrome users are also upset by this. It is annoying the hell out of me because it just takes over my laptop and I can't get into my Start Menu or anything else because it is forcing me to activate it.

I recently updated from v.69.0.1 to v.78.0.2. But the newer version installed in a different folder and now I can run both versions. Yesterday I had the v.69 working with around 500 tabs open. Suddenly it crashed and then freezed. Luckily, I had managed to save my current working session by accessing Tab Session Manager addon. But when I go to Tab Manager Session and click to open this saved session, FF v.69 will keep freezing, no matter what I do. (Tab Session Manager has another option „Export”, but I don't know to use it or what it does.) I will quit using FF v.69. But how can I get the new v.78 to open this 500-tab session? Any help is appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nicolae.lucian

Other times my whole screen just goes blank before I have a chance to do anything and then the blue screen. This does not happen with Chrome or Edge. These are 100% repeatable. ALWAYS with Firefox, NEVER with Chrome or Edge. Blue screen logs show errors related to atikmpag.sys (my graphics driver) and dxgkrnl.sys (DirectX). I checked for a graphics driver update; there was none. So I uninstalled and reinstalled using a fresh download from the motherboard manufacturer's website (using embedded graphics, no discreet GPU in this system). Did not solve the issue. I don't recall what version of Firefox I was using, but I updated to 79.0 and also tried ESR. No change. Ran Mozilla's recommended refresh procedure which removes extensions and resets settings. No change. Booted Windows into Safe Mode and the problem does NOT occur. When I booted back into normal mode, I uninstalled the graphics driver again and tried with default settings -- problem doesn't happen! </p><p>While this appears to be an issue with the graphics driver, it only happens in FF, so there seems to be an issue with the two interacting.  The latest Firefox crash report listed in about:crashes is from November 2019, long before this issue was discovered.

I arrange them in order when researching something. So, there's 20 tabs open, 4 different categories of the subject topic. There has to be a way besides a sidebar, to signify fast which group starts where. Best case scenario would be marking the 1st tab of a group with a flag, or static pop-up - a short, 15 character-limit description to signify which group it is (like '4k', '1080p', '720p', for video resolution values). 2nd-best would be a mouse-hover message, i.e. a flag or balloon to pop-up with the 15-character description. Finally, I could color-code the 1st tab of a group, or even the text .I saw some good extensions that did these - looks like Firefox disabled them with the latest browser upgrade.

I was able to login to the Disk Station Locally using the Local Network IP I had assigned to it, and also able log in via the registered Domain through Synology with a Secure Connection using either method when logging in.  Everything worked perfectly. Over a year ago I had some issues with my network (it has been too long ago for me to remember what it was).  I could not resolve it, so when I called Netgear Tech Support they had me reset my router to factory settings.  This did fix the issue I was having, but I later noticed resetting had changed my IP address.  I thought this was not a problem at the time. It was then I also noticed I was no longer getting a Secure Connection on through my Disk Station. Have been trying to resolve this on my own, but I am not having any luck.  But I am learning as I go. Present Day –  I am still having issues logging in.   The message I get when I log into the Synology registered Domain with Firefox is ""Unable to Connect"".  I tried Chrome and get a similar message. When I log in locally using the assigned IP address I get ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"". </p><pre>I click on the ""Advanced"" button where Firefox displays the Error Message:  SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN.

Weather that is the one that is used for this connection I am speaking of, I do not know. --  The Certificate is current and has not expired. My apologies for this description being lengthy, I just want to make sure I state everything I can think of in order to get this fixed.

I would like the tabs to open in new tabs but I do not want Firefox to immediately switch to them. </p><p>Please note that I have unchecked ""When you open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately"". Meaning, Firefox correctly does not switch to new tabs for normal links.
