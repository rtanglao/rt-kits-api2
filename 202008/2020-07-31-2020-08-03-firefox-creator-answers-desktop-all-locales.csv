I recently updated from v.69.0.1 to v.78.0.2. But the newer version installed in a different folder and now I can run both versions. Yesterday I had the v.69 working with around 500 tabs open. Suddenly it crashed and then freezed. Luckily, I had managed to save my current working session by accessing Tab Session Manager addon. But when I go to Tab Manager Session and click to open this saved session, FF v.69 will keep freezing, no matter what I do. (Tab Session Manager has another option „Export”, but I don't know to use it or what it does.) I will quit using FF v.69. But how can I get the new v.78 to open this 500-tab session? Any help is appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nicolae.lucian

Sometimes I will see the demo animation in on the right get all garbled and if I close FF quickly, no blue screen. Other times my whole screen just goes blank before I have a chance to do anything and then the blue screen. This does not happen with Chrome or Edge. These are 100% repeatable. ALWAYS with Firefox, NEVER with Chrome or Edge. Blue screen logs show errors related to atikmpag.sys (my graphics driver) and dxgkrnl.sys (DirectX). I checked for a graphics driver update; there was none. So I uninstalled and reinstalled using a fresh download from the motherboard manufacturer's website (using embedded graphics, no discreet GPU in this system). Did not solve the issue. I don't recall what version of Firefox I was using, but I updated to 79.0 and also tried ESR. No change. Ran Mozilla's recommended refresh procedure which removes extensions and resets settings. No change. Booted Windows into Safe Mode and the problem does NOT occur. When I booted back into normal mode, I uninstalled the graphics driver again and tried with default settings -- problem doesn't happen! </p><p>While this appears to be an issue with the graphics driver, it only happens in FF, so there seems to be an issue with the two interacting.  The latest Firefox crash report listed in about:crashes is from November 2019, long before this issue was discovered.  I assume that because the whole computer is crashing with a BSOD, FF doesn't register the crash. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-790;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1338573;1338574;1338605;1338621;,kosmicken

I arrange them in order when researching something. So, there's 20 tabs open, 4 different categories of the subject topic. There has to be a way besides a sidebar, to signify fast which group starts where. Best case scenario would be marking the 1st tab of a group with a flag, or static pop-up - a short, 15 character-limit description to signify which group it is (like '4k', '1080p', '720p', for video resolution values). 2nd-best would be a mouse-hover message, i.e. a flag or balloon to pop-up with the 15-character description. Finally, I could color-code the 1st tab of a group, or even the text .I saw some good extensions that did these - looks like Firefox disabled them with the latest browser upgrade. Are there any cross-browser or Firefox persistent apps or add-ons that will let me mark up individual tabs, with either icons, messages, or background colors? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",thevolleyballer

When setting it up, in order to make a secure connection I registered the Domain I planned to use with Synology and received a registered Domain Name.  I then applied for and received a certificate from “Lets Encrypt.  It worked fine for a few years. I was able to login to the Disk Station Locally using the Local Network IP I had assigned to it, and also able log in via the registered Domain through Synology with a Secure Connection using either method when logging in.  Everything worked perfectly. Over a year ago I had some issues with my network (it has been too long ago for me to remember what it was).  I could not resolve it, so when I called Netgear Tech Support they had me reset my router to factory settings.  This did fix the issue I was having, but I later noticed resetting had changed my IP address.  I thought this was not a problem at the time. It was then I also noticed I was no longer getting a Secure Connection on through my Disk Station. Have been trying to resolve this on my own, but I am not having any luck.  But I am learning as I go. Present Day –  I am still having issues logging in.   The message I get when I log into the Synology registered Domain with Firefox is ""Unable to Connect"".  I tried Chrome and get a similar message. When I log in locally using the assigned IP address I get ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"". </p><pre>I click on the ""Advanced"" button where Firefox displays the Error Message:  SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN.

Weather that is the one that is used for this connection I am speaking of, I do not know. --  The Certificate is current and has not expired. My apologies for this description being lengthy, I just want to make sure I state everything I can think of in order to get this fixed.

It was unchanged for whole period I used this feature, as I wrote it wasn't long. Fortunately I have all important passwords saved on the paper so I decided to reset my Firefox Master password. It is possible that I've lost less important passwords but I can reset them because I still have access to my most important data. I do not need any help.

But I decided to report that because there is also a chance that this is Firefox error so you should be aware of my case. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;windows-10;masterpassword;firefox-790;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",artur.a.sakowski

If I just move my mouse down, as if the menu were immediately below the folder link, the corresponding rows on the menu on the other display are highlighted. However, clicking at that point does not select that menu entry. I must move my mouse over to where the menu is displayed, all the way being careful to not move outside of the Y dimension range of that menu (or it vanishes). This does not happen on all folders on the menu, but the ones it happens on vary from day to day. Prior to the version of FF that I am on, it would only happen once to a given menu and then it would start opening the menu where it should. I currently have 15 folders showing on the toolbar and 5 of them consistently misbehave.  </p><p>I'm on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 using the Gnome desktop/window manager (not Wayland). I am using a Dell Laptop XPS-13, connected to a Dell DisplayPort dock which drives two external displays, on which I usually do all my work.

In addition, with the dock connected and the two external displays, if I move the FF window to the laptop's display, the menus display properly. However, in my use of multiple applications, no application besides FF exhibits this problem.  If I open a private session, the problem is not exhibited. </p><p>Adding a screenshot example. I had to crop it on the bottom side to fit in the 1024 Byte limit for attachments. On the bottom, you see a black area on the left, which is where there is no monitor.

Therefore, when browsing in other tabs, gmail is always open.  How can I close it, or better yet, remove from my computer? It does not show up in the list of programs on my computer within the Control Panel. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1337494;,john408
