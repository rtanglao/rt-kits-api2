I got some big July 2020 Cumulative Updates, Security Updates, etc. last week and installed them. They also installed something for EDGE which was a window that would not close and was forcing me to go through a bunch of windows and fill out ""activation"" info. I finally opened Windows Task Manager and ended the task to shut it down. I then tried to uninstall it but more installation was being forced onto my laptop. Finally after a few days the uninstall button was highlighted in the list of ""apps"" and I was able to uninstall it. Today I got an update on my malware protection software subscription from a different company. It restarted my laptop, which was fine, however it brought an install yet again of EDGE, but I use Mozilla Firefox faithfully and have for years. Big fan of Mozilla and I donate every year and try to participate in surveys and all that. I have Firefox in my Windows 10 settings as my default browser. Nonetheless it keeps being foisting on me. I don't know how to reach Mozilla but I suspicion I am not the only one highly annoyed by this aggressive repeat downloading stuff. What I thought I could do is start a thread in the Mozilla Community and see if enough other people are upset. Perhaps Mozilla can do something with Microsoft about this. I would think Google's Chrome users are also upset by this. It is annoying the hell out of me because it just takes over my laptop and I can't get into my Start Menu or anything else because it is forcing me to activate it. I will also be complaining to Microsoft for whatever good that does and looking at forums to see if there is any backlash from other users. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,other,en-US,"",h_matterjones

Just thought to try it on Chrome and it's working fine. Basically, I can log in fine, but when I click over from reader to sites, it gets stuck saying ""loading sites"" forever.

This doesn't happen in Chrome, Windows settings, etc. I've tried assigning specific hotkeys to the input languages (like LShift + Alt + 1) and it doesn't change anything. I have also tried preventing accessibility services from accessing my browser. Whenever I deleted and reinstall the language packs it behaves normally for a day or two before being slow again. This also happens when I restart Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dcswon03

This seems to be an issue relating to how FF and Google are interfacing. For example the NYT is only in English, but any Google search results are in Tegulu.

Every time I try and search for something instead of using google it switches to yahoo? It didn't do this beforehand. I've seen some solutions on here like doing Ctrl + Shift + a and I've done it but it brings me to a blank tab. It's like whatever it is doesn't want me to remove it. I also tried refreshing Firefox and that didn't help either. </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,customize,en-US,1338722;1338811;,cho.laranang
