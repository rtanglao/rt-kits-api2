The partial solution I have found so far (having done this twice so far in almost as many days, and about to do it a second in one day.) is to do a complete uninstall of firefox, then do a windows defender offline scan (which seems to knock out whatever is left in the machine, it won't tell me what was found.) then to come back into win10 and doing a clean install which seems to work well enough (having multiple tabs open [I do miss being able to have large numbers of open tabs and not having my machine going nuts]) till I break down and check the youtube channels that I like to keep up with. main noticeable symptom is my machines cooling fan going into 'hyper' drive, then checking task manager and finding firefox using almost two gigs of memory and 40+% of cpu capacity.

They also installed something for EDGE which was a window that would not close and was forcing me to go through a bunch of windows and fill out ""activation"" info. I finally opened Windows Task Manager and ended the task to shut it down. I then tried to uninstall it but more installation was being forced onto my laptop. Finally after a few days the uninstall button was highlighted in the list of ""apps"" and I was able to uninstall it.

It restarted my laptop, which was fine, however it brought an install yet again of EDGE, but I use Mozilla Firefox faithfully and have for years.

What I thought I could do is start a thread in the Mozilla Community and see if enough other people are upset. Perhaps Mozilla can do something with Microsoft about this. I would think Google's Chrome users are also upset by this. It is annoying the hell out of me because it just takes over my laptop and I can't get into my Start Menu or anything else because it is forcing me to activate it.

I did not want to reset and lose all those, so I did not follow the instructions to reset to the default. </p><p>A second suggestion in that thread was to disable Google Translate. SO I did that, and it seems to be working. The unwanted page prompting to update or install Google Translate came up automatically when either of the two methids I use to open FF were used. 1. Normally, in the AM, I clicl on the FF icon on my task bar, and the unwanted Translate page would open at the end of the other home pages on my list. During the day, after I have read the news, if I open FF I usually just right click on the icon and choose ""Open a New Tab"" from the context menu. That opens just a single blank tab when FF is close. Since this issue with the Translate page started, maybe a week or 10 days ago, it has opened the single blank tab, and the unwanted Translate page. </p><p>SO what I did was open the addons menu and disable the Google Translate menu. That seems to have ended the unwanted Google Translate page from opening. I should also mention that I have CC Cleaner installed, and I observed this morning on the <a href=""http://Ghacks.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Ghacks.net</a> blog that there was an article about CC Cleaner having some interference with FF settings. I wonder if that is part of this? At ""browser.startup.homepage"" the following line is there: ""sync.prefs.sync.browser.startup.homepage""; it was set to ""TRUE"" and I changed it to ""False"" , and that seems to have fixed the issue, at least for now. If that is not the case going forward I will let you know. The only disadvantage to this fix is that I do use Google Translate a fair amount, now I will have to activate it each time I need it. </p><p>Thank you again for the prompt response. </p><p>Buzz </p> id:1338835,created:2020-08-04 08:07:34 -0800,updated:2020-08-04 08:07:34 -0800,creator:McCoy-thereal,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>Hello  buzzb3, </p><p>Does that look anything like what the OP in this thread is seeing (?): </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1297716"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1297716</a> </p>"
