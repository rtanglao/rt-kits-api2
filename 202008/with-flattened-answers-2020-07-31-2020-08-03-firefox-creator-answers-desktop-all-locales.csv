Assign a name like Aug2020, ignore the option to relocate the profile folder, and click the Finish button.  </p><p>After creating the profile, scroll down to it and click the <strong>Launch profile in new browser</strong> button. </p><p>Firefox should open a new window that looks like a brand new, uncustomized installation. (Your existing Firefox window(s) should not be affected.) Please ignore any tabs enticing you to connect to a Sync account or to activate extensions found on your system so we can get a clean test. </p><p><em>Do the problem site(s) work any better in the new profile?</em> </p><p>When you are done with the experiment, you can close the extra window without affecting your regular Firefox profile. (Aug2020 will remain available for future testing.) </p><p>IMPORTANT: Creating a new profile may change your default. If your regular profile has a <strong>Set as Default Profile</strong> button after this test, click that to make sure your next startup doesn't yield a surprise. </p>"

I recently updated from v.69.0.1 to v.78.0.2. But the newer version installed in a different folder and now I can run both versions. Yesterday I had the v.69 working with around 500 tabs open. Suddenly it crashed and then freezed. Luckily, I had managed to save my current working session by accessing Tab Session Manager addon. But when I go to Tab Manager Session and click to open this saved session, FF v.69 will keep freezing, no matter what I do. (Tab Session Manager has another option „Export”, but I don't know to use it or what it does.) I will quit using FF v.69. But how can I get the new v.78 to open this 500-tab session? Any help is appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nicolae.lucian,""

Best case scenario would be marking the 1st tab of a group with a flag, or static pop-up - a short, 15 character-limit description to signify which group it is (like '4k', '1080p', '720p', for video resolution values). 2nd-best would be a mouse-hover message, i.e. a flag or balloon to pop-up with the 15-character description. Finally, I could color-code the 1st tab of a group, or even the text .I saw some good extensions that did these - looks like Firefox disabled them with the latest browser upgrade.

Either: </p> <ul><li> Command+Shift+a (Windows: Ctrl+Shift+a) </li><li> ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Add-ons </li><li> type or paste <strong>about:addons</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return </li></ul> <p>In the left column of the Add-ons page, click Extensions.

The problem being, this window's profile is not in the about:profiles page. The about:profiles page shows the current one being used and one other. However, the one other has the after-update Bookmarks Menu and not the before-update Bookmarks Menu. So, unless there is a way to get the Bookmarks from the old FF window to one of the new FF windows, short of opening every single Bookmark for the past several years and adding it to the new about:profiles, I guess I'm screwed.  </p><p>May I suggest that if you're going to write a file on a person's desktop, that you might inform them through, say, an email, that this file has been added to one's desktop.

The next in line is System Host at 2% and then Task Mgr at 1.1% CPU. Those numbers are similar every time the freeze occurs.  </p><p>This is all I know how to give you.

It started after I reinstalled firefox, which I must presume is a newer version. I am blown away at all the horrible default things this browser does as it is which I know how to change. I CANNOT FATHOM that it would  set as a default to keep passwords. That is EXTREMELY DANGERSOUS and how I got two of my card numbers hacked. Very very bad. Firefox needs to be conservative with the defaults, not balls to the wall. It has all this advertizing, all these photos that have nothign to do with me. But at least I know how to create a blank page or one that i want. This just is a newer version that has done sometbhign with the settings. I can't figure it out. So I usee chrome now. I cannot endure clicking a link that should open my email and I get this box instead, it doesn't even ha e my outlook. sad. This is the problem -- too much tinkering with this browser.

And direct that macro hotkey to use a Mozilla Firefox shortcut that opens up the Home Page. </p><p>But I ran into a problem.  The Firefox Shortcut page says that ALT + H opens up the Home Page.  When I tried it, all it did was toggle the top menu bar off and on, or open up a Firefox Help Page. </p><p>So then I looked at my Saka Keys extension to see if there was an option to set a hotkey for the Home Page.  There was none. </p><p>Then I tried installing another shortkeys extension.  Again, no option to set a hotkey to open up the Home Page. </p><p>Then I did more searching and I found various extensions that will open up the Home Page in a new tab.  Not what I want, ideally, but I had a look at the extensions anyway.  Unfortunately, you can't use a hotkey to open up the tab to that specific Home Page.

1297414,2020-08-01 01:06:22 -0800,2020-08-01T04:03:48Z,Certificate Error SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN,"<p>Background -- I have a Synology Disk Station.  When setting it up, in order to make a secure connection I registered the Domain I planned to use with Synology and received a registered Domain Name.  I then applied for and received a certificate from “Lets Encrypt.  It worked fine for a few years. I was able to login to the Disk Station Locally using the Local Network IP I had assigned to it, and also able log in via the registered Domain through Synology with a Secure Connection using either method when logging in.  Everything worked perfectly. Over a year ago I had some issues with my network (it has been too long ago for me to remember what it was).  I could not resolve it, so when I called Netgear Tech Support they had me reset my router to factory settings.  This did fix the issue I was having, but I later noticed resetting had changed my IP address.  I thought this was not a problem at the time. It was then I also noticed I was no longer getting a Secure Connection on through my Disk Station. Have been trying to resolve this on my own, but I am not having any luck.  But I am learning as I go. Present Day –  I am still having issues logging in.   The message I get when I log into the Synology registered Domain with Firefox is ""Unable to Connect"".  I tried Chrome and get a similar message. When I log in locally using the assigned IP address I get ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"". </p><pre>I click on the ""Advanced"" button where Firefox displays the Error Message:  SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN.  I continue with the exception and able to log into the Disk Station.  </pre> <p>My Goal is to get it working with a secure connection as it did before the Router Reset. --  I have checked all the appropriate ports are open.  5000 and 5001. --  Have checked for any firewall restrictions. --  I have tried replacing the previous certificate with a new one. --  Synology Tech Support does not seem to know, so I figure the problem lies within Windows 10 or Firefox. --  The Certificate in my Windows mmc Console says the Certificate is OK.  Weather that is the one that is used for this connection I am speaking of, I do not know. --  The Certificate is current and has not expired. My apologies for this description being lengthy, I just want to make sure I state everything I can think of in order to get this fixed.  I do not know a lot about this topic, but am learning as I go.  Any help is very much appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1337919;,DennisCal,"id:1337919,created:2020-08-01 04:03:48 -0800,updated:2020-08-01 04:03:48 -0800,creator:fredmcd-hotmail,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<ul><li>MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_MITM_DETECTED </li><li>uses an invalid security certificate    SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN </li><li>configured their website improperly </li></ul> <p>How to troubleshoot the error code ""SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER"" on secure websites <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER</a> </p><p><br> </p><p>There is security software like Avast, Kaspersky, BitDefender and ESET that intercept secure connection certificates and send their own.  </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can</a> </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-and-other-browsers-cant-load-websites"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-and-other-browsers-cant-load-websites</a> </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-error-message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-error-message</a> </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-untrusted-error-message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-untrusted-error-message</a> </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-dont-load-troubleshoot-and-fix-errors?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=Error+loading+web+sites"" rel=""nofollow"">Websites don't load - troubleshoot and fix error messages</a> </p><p><a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Error_loading_websites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Error_loading_websites</a> </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-does-your-connection-is-not-secure-mean"" rel=""nofollow"">What do the security warning codes mean</a> </p>"

I've typed this password at least several times before (with success) so I was sure that I remember it correctly. Fortunately I had it on the paper. I checked it - and I realized, that I remembered it correctly. So I tried once again but I failed. I tried few times with the same result. I had the same password also for different site. So I logged on that site - with success. So my keyboard seems to work correctly. I didn't change master password in Firefox. At least I am not aware of that. It was unchanged for whole period I used this feature, as I wrote it wasn't long. Fortunately I have all important passwords saved on the paper so I decided to reset my Firefox Master password. It is possible that I've lost less important passwords but I can reset them because I still have access to my most important data. I do not need any help. And I am aware that I could made mistake of any type. But I decided to report that because there is also a chance that this is Firefox error so you should be aware of my case. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;windows-10;masterpassword;firefox-790;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",artur.a.sakowski,""

When I open a folder on my bookmarks toolbar, the menu pops up on another display. If I just move my mouse down, as if the menu were immediately below the folder link, the corresponding rows on the menu on the other display are highlighted. However, clicking at that point does not select that menu entry. I must move my mouse over to where the menu is displayed, all the way being careful to not move outside of the Y dimension range of that menu (or it vanishes). This does not happen on all folders on the menu, but the ones it happens on vary from day to day. Prior to the version of FF that I am on, it would only happen once to a given menu and then it would start opening the menu where it should. I currently have 15 folders showing on the toolbar and 5 of them consistently misbehave.  </p><p>I'm on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 using the Gnome desktop/window manager (not Wayland). I am using a Dell Laptop XPS-13, connected to a Dell DisplayPort dock which drives two external displays, on which I usually do all my work. If I drop back to just the laptop, all the folder menus display properly. In addition, with the dock connected and the two external displays, if I move the FF window to the laptop's display, the menus display properly. However, in my use of multiple applications, no application besides FF exhibits this problem.  If I open a private session, the problem is not exhibited. </p><p>Adding a screenshot example. I had to crop it on the bottom side to fit in the 1024 Byte limit for attachments. On the bottom, you see a black area on the left, which is where there is no monitor. On the right is a portion of my laptop's display (cropped on the bottom). On the top are the two displays, and the portion just above the laptop display is my right display, and left is left. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-770;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1337640;1337684;1338636;,KevinBuchs,"id:1338636,created:2020-08-03 11:12:38 -0800,updated:2020-08-03 11:12:38 -0800,creator:KevinBuchs,updated_by:,is_spam:false,num_helpful_votes:0,num_unhelpful_votes:0,content:<p>I was trying uninstalling various extensions to see if that affected the behavior.

I am able to open other types of files locally such as videos. Going to about:preferences and setting firefox to open swf files makes an infinite loop of firefox opening new tabs that must be then terminated.
