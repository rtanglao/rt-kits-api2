It's really glitchy sometimes; either it doesn't show up at all, then I have to manually copy paste my login data, or it moves around on the page when I scroll down, open up the keyboard etc. So I thought, why not use Google's autofill, the feature I've always loved, because it works just perfectly, on Firefox instead. Did that on my tablet and mobile phone, as luckily you can select your autofill provider on Android. Sadly there's no option on Firefox so far (or I missed it, I quickly went through about:config but couldn't find anything there as well)... Maybe there's some hidden option or a safe addon that lets me do that? Any advice would be much appreciated!

My old laptop died the other day and so I bought a new one and put my old drive in an enclosure.  I had my Firefox heavily customised (over the past eight years) and I don't know how to transfer it over.  It used to be that I would just copy the users over and everything would be cool (XP to W7 didn't give me this problem) but it's not working this time.  My guess is that it's because my old laptop used Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  My desktop monster uses Windows 10 Pro but this new laptop uses Windows 10 Home (which is just awful compared to Pro) so there's probably an issue with how the user profiles are handled.  I didn't have a Firefox account because I didn't want every machine I use to have the same Firefox setup.  This was because my desktop and laptop are used for different purposes entirely. Does anyone know how to import the settings from a Windows 7 profile to a Windows 10 profile?  So far, I've had no luck whatsoever.  Thanks!

Once everything has been loaded/displayed once, I can scroll through the page with all the images displayed correctly so I guess this is a matter of Firefox not preloading what's not currently displayed even though it's in the currently read page.

Simply browsing stuff has nearly 0 likelihood of crashing. The frequency varies - something like youtube or steam game browsing will crash with extremely high frequency and will work fine after reopened. Some text based websites will barely ever crash the firefox. What happens is either instant crash(most frequently) or infinite 'not responding' with the solution being task manager end process. Either way it happens - reopening browser reopens all tabs that were open. What I tried: 1) Cleared cache 2) Disabled all extensions. 3) Tried checking about:crashes - 0 reports there in last 30 days... meaning whenever I crash no actual crash report comes in.

I arrange them in order when researching something. So, there's 20 tabs open, 4 different categories of the subject topic. There has to be a way besides a sidebar, to signify fast which group starts where. Best case scenario would be marking the 1st tab of a group with a flag, or static pop-up - a short, 15 character-limit description to signify which group it is (like '4k', '1080p', '720p', for video resolution values). 2nd-best would be a mouse-hover message, i.e. a flag or balloon to pop-up with the 15-character description. Finally, I could color-code the 1st tab of a group, or even the text .I saw some good extensions that did these - looks like Firefox disabled them with the latest browser upgrade.
